1,1,"Mom, Dad, I found cigarettes
"
1,1,"in Greg's jacket.
"
,,
1,1," Greg, were you smoking cigarettes?
"
,,
1,1," No, Dad.
"
,,
1,1,"He's lying. There's no doubt about that.
"
,,
1,1,"Greg, I'm afraid your punishment
"
,,
1,1,"will be four hours in the snakepit.
"
,,
1,1,"That'll give you time to think about
"
,,
1,1,"what you did.
"
,,
1,1,"Man!
"
,,
1,1,"That'll teach him.
"
,,
1,1,"Jan, I'm afraid you've earned
"
,,
1,1,"a day in the fire chamber...
"
,,
1,1,"...for tattling on your brother.
"
,,
1,1,"Smoking. How does
"
,,
1,1,"a boy like that go so wrong?
"
,,
1,1," They live in a crummy neighborhood.
"
,,
1,1," The Bradys?
"
,,
1,1,"Yeah. They got robbers, thugs,
"
,,
1,1,"drug dealers. You name it.
"
,,
1,1,"You folks want some pancakes?
"
,,
1,1,"No, thanks. See, that's the worst
"
,,
1,1,"we got is Jemima's Witnesses.
"
,,
1,1,"""It seems today that all you see
"
,,
1,1,"""is violence in movies and sex on TV
"
,,
1,1,"""But where are those good,
"
,,
1,1,"old-fashioned values
"
,,
1,1,"""on which we used to rely?
"
,,
1,1,"""Lucky there's a family guy
"
,,
1,1,"""Lucky there's a man who'll
"
,,
1,1,"positively tell you
"

1,1,"""all the things that make us

,,
1,1,"""laugh 'n' cry
"
,,
1,1,"""He's a family guy""
"
,,
1,1,"Mom, my lips are too thin.
"
,,
1,1,"Can I please get collagen injections?
"
,,
1,1,"Meg, you don't need to change
"
,,
1,1,"the way you look.
"
,,
1,1,"You know, most of the world's problems
"
,,
1,1,"stem from poor self-image.
"
,,
1,1,"Excellent! The mind-control device
"
,,
1,1,"is nearing completion!
"
,,
1,1,"Stewie, I said no toys at the table.
"
,,
1,1,"Damn you, vile woman!
"
,,
1,1,"You've impeded my work since the day
"
,,
1,1,"I escaped from your wretched womb.
"
,,
1,1,"Don't pout, honey. When you were born...
"
,,
1,1,"...the doctor said you were
"
,,
1,1,"the happiest looking baby he'd ever seen.
"
,,
1,1,"But, of course. That was my victory day.
"
,,
1,1,"The fruition of my deeply-laid plans...
"
,,
1,1,"...to escape from that cursed ovarian
"
,,
1,1,"bastille! Return the device, woman!
"
,,
1,1,"No toys, Stewie.
"
,,
1,1,"Very well, then.
"
,,
1,1,"Mark my words, when you least expect it,
"
,,
1,1,"your uppance will come!
"
,,
1,1,"Mom, can I turn the heat up?
"
,,
1,1,"Don't touch the thermostat, Meg.
"
,,
1,1,"Your father gets upset.
"
,,
1,1,"Come on. This thing goes up to 90.
"
,,
1,1,"Who touched the thermostat?
"
,,
1,1,"God, how does he always know?
"
,,
1,1,"Brain implant, Meg. Every father's got one.
"
,,
1,1,"Tells you when the kids mess with the dial.
"
,,
1,1,"My thing went off!
"
,,
1,1,"Your thermostat okay?
"
,,
1,1," Yeah, it's all right.
"
,,
1,1," Is my kid over here?
"
,,
1,1,"Forget it! False alarm!
"
,,
1,1,"Ass ahoy.
"
,,
1,1,"Peter, it's 7:00 and you've still got
"
,,
1,1,"your pants on. What's the occasion?
"
,,
1,1,"He's going to a stag party.
"
,,
1,1,"Lois, I work hard all week
"
,,
1,1,"to provide for this family.
"
,,
1,1,"I am the man of the house.
"
,,
1,1,"As the man, I order you
"
,,
1,1,"to give me permission to go to this party.
"
,,
1,1,"Look, at least promise me you won't drink.
"
,,
1,1,"Alcohol always leads to trouble.
"
,,
1,1,"Come on. You're worrying about nothing.
"
,,
1,1,"Remember when you got drunk
"
,,
1,1,"off the Communion wine at church?
"
,,
1,1,"And so the Lord God smote poor Job...
"
,,
1,1,"...with festering boils all over his body.
"
,,
1,1,"Man, I hate it when he tells this story.
"
,,
1,1,"Yet, miraculously,
"
,,
1,1,"Job was still able to retain his dignity.
"
,,
1,1," Is that really the blood of Christ?
"
,,
1,1," Yes.
"
,,
1,1,"Man, that guy must've been wasted
"
,,
1,1,"And then there was that time
"
,,
1,1,"at the ice cream store.
"
,,
1,1,"Butter Rum's my favorite.
"
,,
1,1,"Remember you had an Irish coffee
"
,,
1,1,"the day we went to see Philadelphia?
"
,,
1,1,"I got it. That's the guy from Big.
"
,,
1,1,"Tom Hanks, that's it.
"
,,
1,1,"Funny guy, Tom Hanks.
"
,,
1,1,"Everything he says is a stitch.
"
,,
1,1,"I have AIDS.
"
,,
1,1," Promise me, Peter.
"
,,
1,1," Lois, honey, I promise.
"
,,
1,1,"Not a drop of alcohol is gonna touch
"
,,
1,1,"these lips tonight.
"
,,
1,1,"Who wants to play Drink The Beer?
"
,,
1,1,"Right here.
"
,,
1,1," You win.
"
,,
1,1," All right. What do I win?
"
,,
1,1,"Another beer!
"
,,
1,1,"I'm going for the high score!
"
,,
1,1,"Actually, Charlie's got the high score.
"
,,
1,1,"Man. Your clock won't flush.
"
,,
1,1,"I feel kind of bad, guys.
"
,,
1,1,"I promised my wife I wouldn't drink.
"
,,
1,1," Don't feel bad, Peter.
"
,,
1,1," Gee. I never thought of it like that.
"
,,
1,1,"Did you bring the porno?
"
,,
1,1,"Did I bring the porno?
"
,,
1,1,"You're gonna love it. It's a classic.
"
,,
1,1,"Listen, Ilsa. If I take this thing out...
"
,,
1,1,"...and you're not on it, you'll regret it.
"
,,
1,1,"Not today or tomorrow.
"
,,
1,1,"But soon, and for the rest of your life.
"
,,
1,1,"Come on, llsa! Get on it!
"
,,
1,1,"The statue was a gift from France.
"
,,
1,1,"What is this?
"
,,
1,1,"Man. My kid must've taped
"
,,
1,1,"over this for history class.
"
,,
1,1,"The Statue of Liberty?
"
,,
1,1,"What are we gonna do?
"
,,
1,1," Boys, we're gonna drink till she's hot.
"
,,
1,1," That's just crazy enough to work.
"
,,
1,1,"Meg, finish your pancakes.
"
,,
1,1," Chris, elbows off your father.
"
,,
1,1," Thanks, son.
"
,,
1,1,"a great example for the kids, Peter.
"
,,
1,1,"Yeah. A new family record.
"
,,
1,1,"Way to raise the bar, Dad.
"
,,
1,1,"Chris, you're 13. Don't talk like that.
"
,,
1,1,"Kids, Daddy only drank
"
,,
1,1,"so the Statue of Liberty...
"
,,
1,1,"...would take her clothes off.
"
,,
1,1," What did you promise me last night?
"
,,
1,1," I wouldn't drink at the stag party.
"
,,
1,1," And what did you do?
"
,,
1,1," Drank at the stag...
"
,,
1,1,"I almost walked right into that one. God!
"
,,
1,1,"Feels like accountants
"
,,
1,1,"are cranking adding machines in my head.
"
,,
1,1,"Dick, you ever wonder
"
,,
1,1,"what's outside those walls?
"
,,
1,1,"That's dangerous thinking, Paul.
"
,,
1,1,"You best stick to your work.
"
,,
1,1,"Okay.
"
,,
1,1,"You see? A hangover is nature's way
"
,,
1,1,"of telling you I was right. I mean...
"
,,
1,1,"Mom, are you all right?
"
,,
1,1,"My goodness.
"
,,
1,1,"This chair leg was loose. Isn't that silly?
"
,,
1,1,"I could've broken my neck.
"
,,
1,1,"Damn!
"
,,
1,1,"Honey. I took a cab home,
"
,,
1,1,"I slept on the table...
"
,,
1,1,"...so I wouldn't wake you up.
"
,,
1,1,"Nothing bad happened.
"
,,
1,1,"I guess you're right.
"
,,
1,1,"Apology accepted.
"
,,
1,1,"All right, I'm going to work.
"
,,
1,1,"Somebody's gotta put food on this table.
"
,,
1,1,"How are you coming, Johnson?
"
,,
1,1,"Mr. Weed, I've been working
"
,,
1,1,"on the new G.I. Jew line.
"
,,
1,1,"And as you can see, they look great.
"
,,
1,1,"You call these bagels?
"
,,
1,1,"I'm glad he's on our side!
"
,,
1,1,"Peter!
"
,,
1,1,"What?
"
,,
1,1,"Are you sleeping on the job?
"
,,
1,1,"No. There's a bug in my eye
"
,,
1,1,"and I'm trying to suffocate him.
"
,,
1,1,"Peter, I like you. But I need you to be
"
,,
1,1,"more than just eye candy around here.
"
,,
1,1,"It's your job to watch for toys
"
,,
1,1,"that could be hazardous to kids.
"
,,
1,1," Now, look sharp!
"
,,
1,1," Yes, sir!
"
,,
1,1,"And now back to Action News 5.
"
,,
1,1,"Our top story tonight, ""When Toys Attack.""
"
,,
1,1,"Quite a situation we've got here, Tom.
"
,,
1,1,"Quite a situation we've got here, Tom,
"
,,
1,1,"indeed, Diane.
"
,,
1,1,"The Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Company
"
,,
1,1,"of Quahog, Rhode Island...
"
,,
1,1,"...has released highly unsafe
"
,,
1,1,"products into the retail market.
"
,,
1,1,"Come on, Timmy! Throw the Silly Ball!
"
,,
1,1,"Boy! A Pound Poochie!
"
,,
1,1,"Come on, Baby Heimlich, spit it out.
"
,,
1,1,"Peter, I'm appalled.
"
,,
1,1,"Your negligence has damaged
"
,,
1,1,"this company's reputation.
"
,,
1,1,"You're fired!
"
,,
1,1,"Jeez. For how long?
"
,,
1,1,"My God! You got fired?
"
,,
1,1," Way to go, Dad! Fight the machine!
"
,,
1,1," How do you know about the machine?
"
,,
1,1,"Don't worry.
"
,,
1,1,"I'll still put food on this table.
"
,,
1,1,"Just not as much.
"
,,
1,1,"So it might get a little competitive.
"
,,
1,1,"Who cares about food? Now we'll never
"
,,
1,1,"be able to afford my lip injections!
"
,,
1,1,"Can we put her
"
,,
1,1,"out in the yard for a while?
"
,,
1,1,"Okay, who's hungry?
"
,,
1,1,"Jeez. How the hell
"
,,
1,1,"am I gonna break this to Lois?
"
,,
1,1,"If she finds out I got fired for drinking,
"
,,
1,1,"she's gonna blame me!
"
,,
1,1,"Lie to her. It's okay to lie
"
,,
1,1,"to women. They're not people like us.
"
,,
1,1,"I don't know. Hey, where's the other guy?
"
,,
1,1,"Come on, you bastard! I'm late for work.
"
,,
1,1,"This is perfect!
"
,,
1,1,"Look, I don't want your mom to worry,
"
,,
1,1,"all right?
"
,,
1,1,"When she worries, she says,
"
,,
1,1,"""I told you so"" and:
"
,,
1,1,"""Stop doing that. I'm asleep.""
"
,,
1,1,"So I'm just gonna tell a little lie, okay?
"
,,
1,1,"Not a word to your mom
"
,,
1,1,"about me getting canned.
"
,,
1,1,"What's that, Peter?
"
,,
1,1," Nothing. The lost-my-job smells great.
"
,,
1,1," What?
"
,,
1,1,"Meg, honey, can you pass
"
,,
1,1,"the fired-my-ass-for-negligence?
"
,,
1,1,"Peter, are you feeling okay?
"
,,
1,1,"I feel great!
"
,,
1,1,"I haven't got a job in the world.
"
,,
1,1,"All right, then let's eat.
"
,,
1,1,"I know you all hate eggplant, but...
"
,,
1,1,"What on earth was that?
"
,,
1,1,"What the deuce are you staring at?
"
,,
1,1,"It's tuna fish...
"
,,
1,1,"...and nothing else.
"
,,
1,1,"How's your job search going?
"
,,
1,1,"It sucks, Brian. I've already
"
,,
1,1,"been through two jobs this week.
"
,,
1,1,"I got fired off of that commercial.
"
,,
1,1,"Try it again.
"
,,
1,1,"""I'm caca for Cocoa Puffs.""
"
,,
1,1,"No, damn it! Take 26!
"
,,
1,1,"Then I had that job as the sneeze guard
"
,,
1,1,"for that restaurant's salad bar.
"
,,
1,1,"Take it outside, lady.
"
,,
1,1,"I thought I could win money
"
,,
1,1,"in that talent show.
"
,,
1,1,"And the prize goes
"
,,
1,1,"to The von Trapp Family Singers!
"
,,
1,1,"That is bull...
"
,,
1,1,"Peter, I know it's a dangerous precedent...
"
,,
1,1,"...but you might want to tell Lois the truth.
"
,,
1,1,"What? That I can't provide for my family?
"
,,
1,1,"That she's always right?
"
,,
1,1,"That I didn't stand up to a tank
"
,,
1,1,"in Tiananmen Square?
"
,,
1,1,"Screw this!
"
,,
1,1,"I just came over to buy some fireworks!
"
,,
1,1,"You can't keep lying to her
"
,,
1,1,"about losing your job.
"
,,
1,1,"Eventually, she'll find out
"
,,
1,1,"where you're going every day.
"
,,
1,1,"Yeah.
"
,,
1,1,"Yeah, you're right.
"
,,
1,1,"Okay, I'll tell her tonight.
"
,,
1,1,"Victory is mine!
"
,,
1,1,"I'll need the checkbook
"
,,
1,1,"in the morning.
"
,,
1,1,"I'm going to Stop 'N Shop
"
,,
1,1,"for some sweet corn.
"
,,
1,1,"You're spending money on food again?
"
,,
1,1,"Lois, we just had dinner.
"
,,
1,1,"I enjoyed it so much,
"
,,
1,1,"I thought we'd eat again tomorrow.
"
,,
1,1,"Since when are you so concerned
"
,,
1,1,"about our food budget?
"
,,
1,1,"I just...
"
,,
1,1,"Lois, this is really hard for me to say, but...
"
,,
1,1,"What is it, Peter?
"
,,
1,1," You're getting kind of fat.
"
,,
1,1," What?
"
,,
1,1,"It's just... It's not healthy.
"
,,
1,1,"Peter, I do my Jane Fonda workout tape
"
,,
1,1,"three times a week.
"
,,
1,1,"When was the last time you saw your toes?
"
,,
1,1,"I thought you people were
"
,,
1,1,"supposed to be jolly.
"
,,
1,1,"Peter, what the hell is the matter with you?
"
,,
1,1,"Honey, if there's something wrong,
"
,,
1,1,"you can tell me.
"
,,
1,1," Sorry, man. Am I late? What did I miss?
"
,,
1,1," Thank God you're here. What do I do?
"
,,
1,1,"Tell him to keep quiet. He's in too deep.
"
,,
1,1,"I don't know.
"
,,
1,1,"Where's the other guy?
"
,,
1,1,"This is unbelievable!
"
,,
1,1,"I promise you, everything's fine.
"
,,
1,1,"You got nothing to worry about.
"
,,
1,1,"Well, well, Mother!
"
,,
1,1,"We meet again!
"
,,
1,1,"Stewie, I thought
"
,,
1,1,"I tucked you in an hour ago.
"
,,
1,1,"Not tightly enough it would seem.
"
,,
1,1,"And now you contemptible harpy...
"
,,
1,1,"...I shall end your reign
"
,,
1,1,"of matriarchal tyranny.
"
,,
1,1,"You can play tomorrow, honey.
"
,,
1,1,"Right now it's bedtime.
"
,,
1,1,"Blast you and your estrogenical treachery!
"
,,
1,1,"Sweet dreams, kiddo.
"
,,
1,1,"You have the power to end this!
"
,,
1,1,"How'd she take it?
"
,,
1,1,"I told her she was fat.
"
,,
1,1,"No.
"
,,
1,1,"I hate lying to Lois. It's just...
"
,,
1,1,"It's the best way
"
,,
1,1,"to keep her from the truth.
"
,,
1,1,"You have no choice.
"
,,
1,1,"Your unemployment will dry up soon.
"
,,
1,1,"She'll probably sense something's amiss
"
,,
1,1,"when they repossess your house.
"
,,
1,1,"You really oughta think
"
,,
1,1,"of your family's welfare.
"
,,
1,1,"Jeez, Brian! That's a great idea!
"
,,
1,1,"Okay, do you have any disabilities,
"
,,
1,1,"past injuries, physical anomalies?
"
,,
1,1,"I didn't have gas
"
,,
1,1,"for the first time until I was 30.
"
,,
1,1,"What the hell was that?
"
,,
1,1,"Guys, our money problems
"
,,
1,1,"are over! We're officially on welfare.
"
,,
1,1,"Come on, help me scatter car parts
"
,,
1,1,"on the front lawn.
"
,,
1,1,"How much are we getting?
"
,,
1,1,"Let's see. $150 a week.
"
,,
1,1,"Wait. That's a comma, not a decimal.
"
,,
1,1,"Whoops.
"
,,
1,1,"No, I haven't seen Peter all afternoon.
"
,,
1,1,"I was giving a piano lesson.
"
,,
1,1,"Stewie, why don't you play
"
,,
1,1,"in the other room?
"
,,
1,1,"Why don't you burn in hell?
"
,,
1,1,"No dessert for you, young man.
"
,,
1,1,"Who would've thought getting drunk
"
,,
1,1,"would get me...
"
,,
1,1,"...$150,000 a week from the government?
"
,,
1,1,"This is why I don't vote.
"
,,
1,1,"Maybe somebody down there
"
,,
1,1,"was drinking, too.
"
,,
1,1,"Mr. President, why do you think
"
,,
1,1,"the public supports you...
"
,,
1,1,"...during these impeachment proceedings?
"
,,
1,1,"Probably because you're so fat.
"
,,
1,1,"Peter, you might want to call
"
,,
1,1,"the Welfare Commission.
"
,,
1,1,"That check is obviously an oversight.
"
,,
1,1,"Not necessarily. Maybe I'm like
"
,,
1,1,"their one millionth customer.
"
,,
1,1,"What?
"
,,
1,1,"You're gonna spend $150,000 a week?
"
,,
1,1," Yeah.
"
,,
1,1," On what?
"
,,
1,1,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
1,1,"Peter, you bought the statue of David?
"
,,
1,1,"No. I just rented it.
"
,,
1,1,"But they're gonna be ticked.
"
,,
1,1,"The penis broke off
"
,,
1,1,"while I was loading it into the car.
"
,,
1,1,"I shall call you ""Eduardo.""
"
,,
1,1,"Peter, how can we afford this?
"
,,
1,1,"You won't believe it, Mom! Dad's getting...
"
,,
1,1,"A big raise!
"
,,
1,1,"Peter, that's wonderful!
"
,,
1,1,"But, Dad, I thought...
"
,,
1,1,"The kind of raise that'll allow me
"
,,
1,1,"to give my kids a big allowance...
"
,,
1,1,"...just for keeping their big mouths shut.
"
,,
1,1,"Come on, guys.
"
,,
1,1,"I'll buy us
"
,,
1,1,"the most expensive meal we've ever had.
"
,,
1,1,"Yeah.
"
,,
1,1,"I'd like 6,000 chicken fa-ji-tas, please.
"
,,
1,1,"I beg your pardon?
"
,,
1,1,"And a ""So-sage"" McBiscuit, please.
"
,,
1,1,"Peter, what's the big surprise?
"
,,
1,1,"You know how I always said
"
,,
1,1,"you should be treated like a queen?
"
,,
1,1,"I got you your own jester.
"
,,
1,1,"Good to be here in New England.
"
,,
1,1,"And what's the deal
"
,,
1,1,"with ""New"" England anyway?
"
,,
1,1,"It's over 200 years old!
"
,,
1,1,"Last time I checked, that's not that new.
"
,,
1,1,"This is great.
"
,,
1,1,"I can finally afford to give my little girl
"
,,
1,1,"the lips she's always dreamed of.
"
,,
1,1,"Thank you, Daddy!
"
,,
1,1,"I don't know, Peter. Lips are one thing.
"
,,
1,1,"But did you have to buy
"
,,
1,1,"breast implants for Chris?
"
,,
1,1,"It makes him happy.
"
,,
1,1,"These are cool.
"
,,
1,1,"When did you get a pool?
"
,,
1,1,"It's a moat.
"
,,
1,1,"I know it's silly...
"
,,
1,1,"...but my husband thinks our family
"
,,
1,1,"needs extra protection now that...
"
,,
1,1,"...we're rich.
"
,,
1,1,"Does it work?
"
,,
1,1,"It does keep the Black Knight at bay.
"
,,
1,1,"Congratulations in all your success.
"
,,
1,1,"Here's your welfare check.
"
,,
1,1,"What the...
"
,,
1,1,"Hi, honey.
"
,,
1,1,"What?
"
,,
1,1,"I know what I did was wrong.
"
,,
1,1,"But I only did it for you and the kids.
"
,,
1,1,"Except for the jukebox in the bathroom.
"
,,
1,1,"That was for Peter.
"
,,
1,1,"Yeah, from the American taxpayers.
"
,,
1,1,"I am so mad I can't see straight.
"
,,
1,1,"No problem.
"
,,
1,1,"We got money to get that fixed...
"
,,
1,1,"...with enough left for us to buy our way
"
,,
1,1,"out of any trouble our kids might get into.
"
,,
1,1,"Just like the Kennedys.
"
,,
1,1,"I feel like I don't
"
,,
1,1,"even know you anymore, Peter.
"
,,
1,1,"The man I married would never think
"
,,
1,1,"he could fix a problem...
"
,,
1,1,"...just by spending money!
"
,,
1,1,"Boy, she's pretty pissed.
"
,,
1,1,"Who thought fraud
"
,,
1,1,"would be one of her buttons?
"
,,
1,1,"Why have a jukebox
"
,,
1,1,"in the john if your wife's mad at you?
"
,,
1,1,"Peter, you may have to return
"
,,
1,1,"that money to the taxpayers.
"
,,
1,1,"But I gotta make sure
"
,,
1,1,"Lois knows I'm doing it.
"
,,
1,1,"I need an event with thousands of people.
"
,,
1,1,"Something that everybody cares about.
"
,,
1,1,"We might have to leave
"
,,
1,1,"Rhode Island for this.
"
,,
1,1,"The air is electric here
"
,,
1,1,"at Super Bowl XXXIII tonight!
"
,,
1,1,"Pat, it's safe to say that all
"
,,
1,1,"these fans came out here...
"
,,
1,1,"...to watch a game of football!
"
,,
1,1,"John, we're in commercial.
"
,,
1,1,"Yeah, I know.
"
,,
1,1,"I'm just making conversation. Come on.
"
,,
1,1,"Football!
"
,,
1,1,"Amazing. You can barely drive a car.
"
,,
1,1,"Yet you were allowed to fly a blimp?
"
,,
1,1,"Yeah, America's great, isn't it?
"
,,
1,1,"Except for the South.
"
,,
1,1,"Boy, I hope Lois is watching.
"
,,
1,1,"Okay, taxpayers, here you go!
"
,,
1,1,"Looks like we're getting some rain
"
,,
1,1,"here tonight, John.
"
,,
1,1,"Yeah. Hey, wait a second!
"
,,
1,1,"This is no ordinary rain!
"
,,
1,1,"It's some kind of crazy money rain!
"
,,
1,1,"I'm being told it's a man and his dog
"
,,
1,1,"throwing cash out of a blimp.
"
,,
1,1,"Man. I hope this works. Otherwise,
"
,,
1,1,"I'm gonna have to start dropping these.
"
,,
1,1,"The crowd is storming the field!
"
,,
1,1,"This is pandemonium!
"
,,
1,1,"Have you ever seen anything like this, Pat?
"
,,
1,1,"Just once. The 1975 Cotton Bowl.
"
,,
1,1,"This is the old ""trying to make amends...
"
,,
1,1,"""...for spending $150,000 a week
"
,,
1,1,"in misappropriated welfare funds"" play.
"
,,
1,1,"I don't care what it is! That guy's ruining
"
,,
1,1,"a perfectly good game of football!
"
,,
1,1," Madden to Fox Security.
"
,,
1,1," Go ahead.
"
,,
1,1,"Take them down!
"
,,
1,1,"Yes, sir.
"
,,
1,1,"How was your shower?
"
,,
1,1,"I tell you, all of the rumors
"
,,
1,1,"about dropping the soap are true.
"
,,
1,1,"Really?
"
,,
1,1,"You can't hold onto that thing
"
,,
1,1,"to save your life.
"
,,
1,1,"It was slipping everywhere.
"
,,
1,1,"Guys were laughing.
"
,,
1,1,"There's the guy
"
,,
1,1,"that couldn't hold the soap.
"
,,
1,1,"That was classic.
"
,,
1,1,"Boy. I really let Lois down this time.
"
,,
1,1,"Do you think she'll wait for me?
"
,,
1,1,"If every woman dumped her husband...
"
,,
1,1,"...for crashing a blimp,
"
,,
1,1,"no one would be married.
"
,,
1,1,"Yeah, you're right.
"
,,
1,1,"Okay, I got the top bunk.
"
,,
1,1,"My collagen is wearing off.
"
,,
1,1,"Honey, sagging lips are just nature's way...
"
,,
1,1,"...of telling you you shouldn't
"
,,
1,1,"cover for your father's lie.
"
,,
1,1,"What does it mean when your armpits
"
,,
1,1,"cry stinky tears?
"
,,
1,1,"It means you're becoming a man.
"
,,
1,1,"But hopefully not the kind who stays out
"
,,
1,1,"all day and doesn't call...
"
,,
1,1,"...like your father
"
,,
1,1,"who shall remain nameless.
"
,,
1,1,"Hello, Mother.
"
,,
1,1,"Hi there, sweetie.
"
,,
1,1,"You know, Mother,
"
,,
1,1,"life is like a box of chocolates.
"
,,
1,1,"You never know what you're going to get.
"
,,
1,1,"Your life, however,
"
,,
1,1,"is more like a box of active grenades!
"
,,
1,1,"Now, I offer one last chance
"
,,
1,1,"for deliverance.
"
,,
1,1,"Return my mind-control device
"
,,
1,1,"or be destroyed.
"
,,
1,1,"You just want your toy back.
"
,,
1,1,"Okay, here you go, honey.
"
,,
1,1,"Yes... Well, victory is mine!
"
,,
1,1,"Damn you all!
"
,,
1,1,"Hello?
"
,,
1,1,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
1,1,"Lois, am I glad to see you.
"
,,
1,1,"I have nothing to say to you, Peter.
"
,,
1,1,"I gave the money back.
"
,,
1,1,"Why are you still steamed?
"
,,
1,1,"Peter, you lied to me,
"
,,
1,1,"you betrayed my trust.
"
,,
1,1,"Compared to that,
"
,,
1,1,"welfare fraud doesn't even matter.
"
,,
1,1,"Really?
"
,,
1,1,"Let's hope the judge feels that way.
"
,,
1,1,"This court will come to order.
"
,,
1,1,"I figured the sooner I cashed the check...
"
,,
1,1,"...the sooner they'd catch their mistake.
"
,,
1,1,"Why are we making a federal case
"
,,
1,1,"out of this?
"
,,
1,1,"Don't you think you should
"
,,
1,1,"have alerted the government...
"
,,
1,1,"...of such a gross overpayment?
"
,,
1,1,"I was gonna call them.
"
,,
1,1,"But my favorite episode...
"
,,
1,1,"...of Different Strokes was on.
"
,,
1,1,"The one where Arnold and Dudley...
"
,,
1,1,"...get sexually molested
"
,,
1,1,"by the bike shop owner?
"
,,
1,1,"All right. Now I want you boys
"
,,
1,1,"to scream real loud at my ass.
"
,,
1,1,"And everybody learns a valuable lesson.
"
,,
1,1,"Mr. Griffin, have you learned a lesson?
"
,,
1,1,"Yes. Stay the hell away
"
,,
1,1,"from that bike shop.
"
,,
1,1,"Okay, everybody, I feel really bad
"
,,
1,1,"about what I did. I just...
"
,,
1,1,"I don't know. I saw the one chance...
"
,,
1,1,"...l'd ever have to give my family
"
,,
1,1,"the things they deserve.
"
,,
1,1,"I guess I screwed it up.
"
,,
1,1,"I cheated the government.
"
,,
1,1,"And worst of all, I lied to my wife.
"
,,
1,1,"And she deserves better.
"
,,
1,1,"I'm sorry, honey.
"
,,
1,1,"Mr. Griffin, I think your words
"
,,
1,1,"have touched us all.
"
,,
1,1,"I'm sentencing you to 24 months in prison.
"
,,
1,1,"No!
"
,,
1,1," No!
"
,,
1,1," No!
"
,,
1,1,"No!
"
,,
1,1,"Yeah!
"
,,
1,1,"Excuse me, Your Honor?
"
,,
1,1,"Yes?
"
,,
1,1,"Look, my husband may be
"
,,
1,1,"a bit thoughtless at times.
"
,,
1,1,"He may even be downright stupid.
"
,,
1,1,"But I know he only accepted that money...
"
,,
1,1,"...because he wanted to be
"
,,
1,1,"a good husband and father.
"
,,
1,1,"But what he needs to remember
"
,,
1,1,"is that we love him.
"
,,
1,1,"And no matter what,
"
,,
1,1,"I'll always stand by him.
"
,,
1,1,"I love you too, honey.
"
,,
1,1,"That was very moving, Mrs. Griffin.
"
,,
1,1,"Okay, you can go to jail with him!
"
,,
1,1,"What?
"
,,
1,1,"Intolerable as it may be...
"
,,
1,1,"...l'm completely dependent upon
"
,,
1,1,"those wretched drones for sustenance.
"
,,
1,1,"Let us see how the constitution
"
,,
1,1,"of American justice fares...
"
,,
1,1,"...against the device!
"
,,
1,1,"Is that your boy?
"
,,
1,1,"What? Yeah. That's Stewie.
"
,,
1,1,"Gosh. I can't separate a kid that young
"
,,
1,1,"from his father. It's unjudgmenly.
"
,,
1,1," Hell, you've learned your lesson, right?
"
,,
1,1," Yeah.
"
,,
1,1," All right. You're free.
"
,,
1,1," Wow! Can you give me my job back?
"
,,
1,1,"No.
"
,,
1,1," Yes.
"
,,
1,1," All right!
"
,,
1,1,"That was a crazy one, Dick.
"
,,
1,1,"It sure was. In this next blooper
"
,,
1,1,"from Joanie Loves Chachi...
"
,,
1,1,"...watch what happens when Scott Baio
"
,,
1,1,"tries to say:
"
,,
1,1,"""She sells seashells
"
,,
1,1,"down by the seashore.""
"
,,
1,1,"What does your mom do?
"
,,
1,1,"She sells seashells down by the...
"
,,
1,1,"That is kind of a tongue twister.
"
,,
1,1,"It's good to have you home, Peter.
"
,,
1,1,"Honey, I knew everything
"
,,
1,1,"would turn out okay.
"
,,
1,1,"I sure am gonna miss being rich.
"
,,
1,1,"Don't worry.
"
,,
1,1,"I got a way to get money.
"
,,
1,1,"Not another welfare scam?
"
,,
1,1,"No. Minority scholarship.
"
,,
1,1,"No.
"
,,
1,1,"Are you insane?
"
,,
1,1,"Okay, I mean sexual harassment suit.
"
,,
1,1,"No.
"
,,
1,1,"Don't think so.
"
,,
1,1,"Absolutely outrageous.
"
,,
1,1,"Okay, disability claim.
"
,,
1,2,"Look at Stewie.
"
,,
1,2,"Isn't he adorable
"
,,
1,2,"playing with his Sesame Street phone?
"
,,
1,2,"Put me through to the Pentagon.
"
,,
1,2,"What sound does a cow make?
"
,,
1,2,"Don't toy with me!
"
,,
1,2,"I've already dispatched with Mr. Hooper.
"
,,
1,2,"I've six armed men outside Big Bird's nest.
"
,,
1,2,"And as for Linda?
"
,,
1,2,"It's difficult for a deaf woman
"
,,
1,2,"to hear an assassin approach, isn't it?
"
,,
1,2,"Can you count to three?
"
,,
1,2,"Indeed I can.
"
,,
1,2,"One! Two! Three!
"
,,
1,2,"Can I count to three? For God's sake,
"
,,
1,2,"I'm already shooting at a fifth-grade level.
"
,,
1,2,"""It seems today that all you see

"

1,2,"Now open up for the airplane.
"
,,
1,2,"Never! Damn the broccoli! Damn you!
"
,,
1,2,"And damn the Wright Brothers!
"
,,
1,2,"My, aren't we fussy tonight.
"
,,
1,2,"Okay. No broccoli.
"
,,
1,2,"Very well then. L...
"
,,
1,2,"Who the hell do you think you are?
"
,,
1,2,"Honey, it's not gonna go away
"
,,
1,2,"just because you don't like it.
"
,,
1,2,"Well, then. My goal becomes clear.
"
,,
1,2,"The broccoli must die.
"
,,
1,2,"Mom, will you take me out
"
,,
1,2,"to practice driving?
"
,,
1,2,"I'm teaching a piano lesson in half an hour.
"
,,
1,2,"Maybe your father can take you.
"
,,
1,2,"Sorry, Meg. Daddy loves you.
"
,,
1,2,"But Daddy also loves Star Trek.
"
,,
1,2,"And, in all fairness,
"
,,
1,2,"Star Trek was here first.
"
,,
1,2,"Captain's log, Stardate 8169.7.
"
,,
1,2,"The Enterprise has just discovered
"
,,
1,2,"a strange new planet...
"
,,
1,2,"...in the Gamma Faloppia star system.
"
,,
1,2,"Mr. Sulu, ahead Warp 9.
"
,,
1,2,"For God's sake, Peter.
"
,,
1,2,"You've been in front of the TV
"
,,
1,2,"since you got home from work.
"
,,
1,2,"Why don't you spend some time
"
,,
1,2,"with your family?
"
,,
1,2,"I will, during the commercials.
"
,,
1,2,"And if that's wrong, maybe I'm missing
"
,,
1,2,"the point of having commercials.
"
,,
1,2,"Please. My road test is tomorrow
"
,,
1,2,"and you haven't taught me anything.
"
,,
1,2,"You may want to find
"
,,
1,2,"a better teacher than Peter.
"
,,
1,2,"What are you talking about?
"
,,
1,2,"I'm a great driver.
"
,,
1,2,"Remember your trip to the Southwest?
"
,,
1,2," Jeez. Did I just hit that ostrich?
"
,,
1,2," No.
"
,,
1,2," Are you sure?
"
,,
1,2," He's fine. Keep going.
"
,,
1,2,"Don't believe that.
"
,,
1,2,"I always keep my eyes on the road.
"
,,
1,2,"I don't miss a thing.
"
,,
1,2,"We now return to Star Trek.
"
,,
1,2,"Holy crap. Uhura's black?
"
,,
1,2,"All right, Meg.
"
,,
1,2,"Now here's your first lesson.
"
,,
1,2,"You always want to be aware
"
,,
1,2,"of other cars on the road.
"
,,
1,2,"If you catch eyes with the guy next to you
"
,,
1,2,"at a red light, you gotta race him.
"
,,
1,2," This guy's asking for it.
"
,,
1,2," But Dad...
"
,,
1,2,"I don't make the rules, honey.
"
,,
1,2,"Now rev your engine twice.
"
,,
1,2,"Okay.
"
,,
1,2,"Go!
"
,,
1,2,"You forgot to flip him off.
"
,,
1,2,"But other than that, nice job.
"
,,
1,2,"You're back already?
"
,,
1,2,"That wasn't much of a lesson.
"
,,
1,2,"I didn't want to overload her
"
,,
1,2,"on her first time out.
"
,,
1,2,"Besides CHiPs is about to start.
"
,,
1,2,"So let's sit back and get lost in a world
"
,,
1,2,"of California Highway Patrol fantasy!
"
,,
1,2," What's the charge, Officer?
"
,,
1,2," Driving without my phone number.
"
,,
1,2,"Or maybe I should arrest you
"
,,
1,2,"for being too beautiful.
"
,,
1,2,"So, broccoli, Mother says
"
,,
1,2,"you're very good for me.
"
,,
1,2,"I'm afraid I'm no good for you!
"
,,
1,2,"The first rule of war is know thine enemy.
"
,,
1,2,"And I know this! Cold kills broccoli!
"
,,
1,2,"It's so simple.
"
,,
1,2,"All I need to do is build a machine
"
,,
1,2,"to control the global environment.
"
,,
1,2,"Forecast for tomorrow, a few sprinkles
"
,,
1,2,"of genius with a chance of doom!
"
,,
1,2,"This is taking forever!
"
,,
1,2,"Come on. Let's go. Fox is running
"
,,
1,2,"one of those new reality shows at 8:00.
"
,,
1,2,"Fast Animals, Slow Children.
"
,,
1,2,"Come on, guys. Wait up.
"
,,
1,2,"Dang. I got honey all over my legs.
"
,,
1,2,"Dad, we can't leave now. My entire life
"
,,
1,2,"depends on getting my license.
"
,,
1,2,"If I can't drive, I'll never have a boyfriend,
"
,,
1,2,"never get married...
"
,,
1,2,"...and then I'll have to adopt a kid
"
,,
1,2,"like Rosie O'Donnell.
"
,,
1,2,"Are you implying
"
,,
1,2,"that Rosie O'Donnell can't drive?
"
,,
1,2,"I'm so nervous.
"
,,
1,2,"You're gonna do great.
"
,,
1,2,"Remember everything I taught you.
"
,,
1,2," Let's start by going down Main Street.
"
,,
1,2," Okay.
"
,,
1,2," What are you doing?
"
,,
1,2," I'm driving.
"
,,
1,2,"Are you gonna mark me down
"
,,
1,2,"for not flipping him off?
"
,,
1,2,"God, my life is over.
"
,,
1,2,"I am the biggest loser I know!
"
,,
1,2,"I know how you feel, pumpkin.
"
,,
1,2,"I've had my share of disappointments, too.
"
,,
1,2,"It's a girl!
"
,,
1,2,"Can you check again?
"
,,
1,2,"You just have to remember that life
"
,,
1,2,"has its little ups and... Jeez!
"
,,
1,2,"We're gonna miss the beginning
"
,,
1,2,"of my show. There it is.
"
,,
1,2,"Dad, watch out!
"
,,
1,2,"Meg, honey, are you okay?
"
,,
1,2,"Yeah, I think so.
"
,,
1,2,"The Quahog
"
,,
1,2,"Cable Television Transmitter.
"
,,
1,2,"You just knocked out cable TV
"
,,
1,2,"for the whole town!
"
,,
1,2,"Boy! Look. There's Bigfoot!
"
,,
1,2,"Whoa. This isn't about me.
"
,,
1,2,"This is about you.
"
,,
1,2,"At least I bought us some time.
"
,,
1,2," She did it.
"
,,
1,2," What? Dad, you were the one driving!
"
,,
1,2,"I was teaching her to drive
"
,,
1,2,"and she lost control of the car.
"
,,
1,2,"Come on, we all did stupid stuff
"
,,
1,2,"when we were kids, right?
"
,,
1,2,"I remember when I tried
"
,,
1,2,"to sneak into an R-rated movie.
"
,,
1,2," Come on. Give the kid a break, huh?
"
,,
1,2," Why should we?
"
,,
1,2,"She got her arm shot off in Vietnam.
"
,,
1,2,"Poor kid.
"
,,
1,2,"What a senseless war.
"
,,
1,2,"I can't believe you just sold out
"
,,
1,2,"your own daughter.
"
,,
1,2,"I know what I did was wrong. And I know
"
,,
1,2,"it's not the first time I've embarrassed you.
"
,,
1,2,"And if you add the measure
"
,,
1,2,"of the angles of a right triangle, the sum...
"
,,
1,2,"Meg, clean out the shower
"
,,
1,2,"the next time you shave your legs.
"
,,
1,2,"It's like a carpet in there.
"
,,
1,2,"I hate to see you so upset.
"
,,
1,2,"I know. Let's play a little game
"
,,
1,2,"called Taking the Fall for Daddy.
"
,,
1,2,"If you win, I'll buy you a convertible
"
,,
1,2,"when you get your license.
"
,,
1,2,"Really? Daddy! Now I love you again!
"
,,
1,2,"You're gonna make
"
,,
1,2,"some Jewish guy a great wife.
"
,,
1,2,"Because of an accident
"
,,
1,2,"at the Quahog Cable Company...
"
,,
1,2,"...television transmission will be out
"
,,
1,2,"for an undetermined amount of time.
"
,,
1,2,"Of course, no one can see
"
,,
1,2,"this news program...
"
,,
1,2,"...so it doesn't really matter what we say.
"
,,
1,2,"I'm the Lord Jesus Christ.
"
,,
1,2,"Think I'll go get drunk and beat up midgets.
"
,,
1,2,"How about you?
"
,,
1,2,"Tom, I just plain don't like black people.
"
,,
1,2,"You guys, we're still on in Boston.
"
,,
1,2,"Excellent.
"
,,
1,2,"The weather machine is nearly completed.
"
,,
1,2,"What do you say to that, broccoli?
"
,,
1,2,"Stop mocking me! What's this?
"
,,
1,2,"It appears the witless provider
"
,,
1,2,"has finally brought me something of value.
"
,,
1,2,"I can use that crude device
"
,,
1,2,"to amplify my deadly signal.
"
,,
1,2,"Victory shall yet be mine.
"
,,
1,2,"Guess what, Mom?
"
,,
1,2,"Dad crashed the car
"
,,
1,2,"into the city cable transmitter.
"
,,
1,2," What?
"
,,
1,2," It's okay.
"
,,
1,2,"If I take the blame, he'll buy me
"
,,
1,2,"a convertible when I get my license.
"
,,
1,2,"Meg, it's not exactly taking the blame
"
,,
1,2,"if you go around telling everyone.
"
,,
1,2,"Peter, you're bribing your daughter
"
,,
1,2,"with a car?
"
,,
1,2,"Come on, Lois.
"
,,
1,2,"Isn't ""bribe"" just another word for ""love""?
"
,,
1,2,"You wanted me and Meg to bond.
"
,,
1,2,"That's what we're doing.
"
,,
1,2,"Dad, I was in a chat room
"
,,
1,2,"on America Online...
"
,,
1,2,"...and Doomie 22 told me
"
,,
1,2,"some idiot knocked out the cable.
"
,,
1,2,"We could be without TV for weeks!
"
,,
1,2,"Now, Chris, now let's not panic.
"
,,
1,2,"We can manage just fine without TV.
"
,,
1,2," What's that supposed to mean?
"
,,
1,2," Face it, you're addicted to television.
"
,,
1,2,"You're not exactly Mr. Cold Turkey.
"
,,
1,2,"Remember when you gave up candy?
"
,,
1,2,"I'll ask you one more time.
"
,,
1,2,"You didn't eat anything in my factory?
"
,,
1,2,"No.
"
,,
1,2," I'm just asking...
"
,,
1,2," Are you calling me a liar?
"
,,
1,2," I'm just saying...
"
,,
1,2," Shut up, Wonka.
"
,,
1,2,"Yeah. That was different. I'll be fine.
"
,,
1,2," Are you sure, honey?
"
,,
1,2," For God's sake, you guys.
"
,,
1,2,"You think I'm some simp who can't live
"
,,
1,2,"without TV? Give me a break.
"
,,
1,2," What's happening now?
"
,,
1,2," Sipowicz is finding who stabbed the super.
"
,,
1,2,"Are you gonna tell me,
"
,,
1,2,"or am I gonna have to show you my ass?
"
,,
1,2,"I ain't saying nothing!
"
,,
1,2,"All right, it was Jimmy the Hat!
"
,,
1,2,"Forget it, Mike.
"
,,
1,2,"Without actually seeing his ass,
"
,,
1,2,"this is just radio.
"
,,
1,2,"Class, we were scheduled to watch
"
,,
1,2,"a PBS program on the mating rituals...
"
,,
1,2,"...of the nude large-breasted Weewok tribe
"
,,
1,2,"of New Guinea.
"
,,
1,2,"Unfortunately, Megan Griffin ruined TV.
"
,,
1,2,"So instead, we're having a surprise test.
"
,,
1,2,"Suddenly I was
"
,,
1,2,"public enemy number one.
"
,,
1,2,"It was time to tell the truth.
"
,,
1,2,"Wait! I didn't drive into the satellite dish!
"
,,
1,2,"And who did?
"
,,
1,2,"I was just a 15-year-old girl.
"
,,
1,2,"But at that moment, I realized I had
"
,,
1,2,"a whole lifetime to make new friends.
"
,,
1,2,"But only one chance to get a new car.
"
,,
1,2,"And I had to take it.
"
,,
1,2,"Okay, I did it.
"
,,
1,2,"I don't know how much longer
"
,,
1,2,"I can last.
"
,,
1,2,"It's been a whole week
"
,,
1,2,"since I seen a TV show.
"
,,
1,2,"I wonder what Scooby and the gang
"
,,
1,2,"are up to now.
"
,,
1,2,"We now return to
"
,,
1,2,"The Scooby Doo Murder Files.
"
,,
1,2,"Gee whiz, gang.
"
,,
1,2,"The killer gutted the victim,
"
,,
1,2,"strangled him with his own intestines...
"
,,
1,2,"...and then dumped the body in the river!
"
,,
1,2," Jinkies! What a mystery!
"
,,
1,2,"You're right, Scoob.
"
,,
1,2,"We're dealing with one sick son of a bitch.
"
,,
1,2,"You just need to find something
"
,,
1,2,"to fill the void that's left in your life.
"
,,
1,2,"Lois has knitting, Chris has video games,
"
,,
1,2,"Meg's learning how to drive.
"
,,
1,2,"And me, I like the sauce.
"
,,
1,2,"Whose leg do you have to hump
"
,,
1,2,"to get a dry martini around here?
"
,,
1,2,"Can't live without TV. Must see TV.
"
,,
1,2,"Stewie, I expect you
"
,,
1,2,"to finish off your vegetables.
"
,,
1,2,"Rest assured, you relentless harridan,
"
,,
1,2,"I expect I shall finish them all off!
"
,,
1,2,"And you as well!
"
,,
1,2,"Brian, I'm a little worried about Peter.
"
,,
1,2,"Last night I woke up and he was
"
,,
1,2,"channel surfing through static.
"
,,
1,2,"I'm sure he'll find a way to cope.
"
,,
1,2," Morning, Lois.
"
,,
1,2," And you were worried.
"
,,
1,2," Peter, what the hell is that?
"
,,
1,2," It's my favorite TV family, the Griffins.
"
,,
1,2,"Peter, you're scaring me. I'm beginning
"
,,
1,2,"to think you're losing your grip on reality.
"
,,
1,2,"Boring. I'll go see what else is on.
"
,,
1,2,"Peter! Keep an eye on Stewie.
"
,,
1,2,"Don't move!
"
,,
1,2,"A little help?
"
,,
1,2,"It's Glen Quagmire,
"
,,
1,2,"the wacky next-door neighbor.
"
,,
1,2,"What's he up to this time?
"
,,
1,2,"I'm going to work!
"
,,
1,2,"Him and his crazy get-rich-quick schemes.
"
,,
1,2,"We have to find your father, Chris.
"
,,
1,2,"He's not well.
"
,,
1,2,"I never knew anyone who went crazy
"
,,
1,2,"before except my invisible friend...
"
,,
1,2,"...Col. Schwartz!
"
,,
1,2,"I get all the channels on this thing.
"
,,
1,2,"Lifetime.
"
,,
1,2,"CBS.
"
,,
1,2,"Hey, UPN.
"
,,
1,2,"All right. 90210.
"
,,
1,2," Dad?
"
,,
1,2," Meg, what are you doing at West Beverly?
"
,,
1,2,"They're really reaching for guest stars
"
,,
1,2,"in the 10th season.
"
,,
1,2,"Dad, what are you doing? Get out of here!
"
,,
1,2,"I'm already a total outcast because of you!
"
,,
1,2,"You're just upset because you wrecked
"
,,
1,2,"the cable transmitter.
"
,,
1,2,"I did not! Forget it.
"
,,
1,2,"What good is a car if I have no friends?
"
,,
1,2,"I didn't wreck TV! My dad did!
"
,,
1,2," What?
"
,,
1,2," What'd she say?
"
,,
1,2," Peter Griffin ruined TV?
"
,,
1,2," And blamed his daughter?
"
,,
1,2,"That's the lowest thing I've ever heard.
"
,,
1,2,"Peter, take that thing off and come home.
"
,,
1,2,"Hey, Lois. You're just in time
"
,,
1,2,"for the exciting conclusion.
"
,,
1,2,"Looks like some boob's
"
,,
1,2,"about to get lynched. Let's watch.
"
,,
1,2,"There they are.
"
,,
1,2,"That's the guy who ruined our cable.
"
,,
1,2,"Let's get him!
"
,,
1,2,"Stop! What is wrong with you people?
"
,,
1,2,"Okay, yes. My husband is responsible
"
,,
1,2,"for knocking out TV.
"
,,
1,2,"But we should be thanking him.
"
,,
1,2,"He's broken television's hypnotic spell
"
,,
1,2,"over us.
"
,,
1,2,"Now we can see the world for what it is...
"
,,
1,2,"...a beautiful place full of wonderful things
"
,,
1,2,"just waiting to be experienced.
"
,,
1,2,"Another chick flick.
"
,,
1,2,"She's right. All the hours we've wasted
"
,,
1,2,"on that damn idiot box.
"
,,
1,2," I'm gonna paint my house!
"
,,
1,2," I'll build a ship in a bottle.
"
,,
1,2,"I'm gonna push a hoop with a stick
"
,,
1,2,"down a dirt road.
"
,,
1,2,"I'll take you home, honey.
"
,,
1,2,"I can't believe I let Meg take the blame.
"
,,
1,2,"You were right, Lois. TV is evil.
"
,,
1,2,"I hear that Manson guy watches it
"
,,
1,2,"in jail all day long.
"
,,
1,2,"If I haven't seen it, it's new to me.
"
,,
1,2,"You just went a little overboard.
"
,,
1,2,"You need a little balance in your life.
"
,,
1,2,"There are other things to appreciate
"
,,
1,2,"besides television.
"
,,
1,2," You mean like this lamp?
"
,,
1,2," Yeah. Okay.
"
,,
1,2," The lamp gives us light.
"
,,
1,2," I get it.
"
,,
1,2,"And your family gives you love.
"
,,
1,2,"You should spend some time
"
,,
1,2,"with our kids, Peter. And with me.
"
,,
1,2,"What could me and you do together?
"
,,
1,2,"Lois! You've got a sick mind!
"
,,
1,2,"Peter, I'm talking about making love.
"
,,
1,2,"I thought you wanted us to murder
"
,,
1,2,"the children and harvest their organs...
"
,,
1,2,"...for beer money.
"
,,
1,2,"What a gorgeous day.
"
,,
1,2,"Isn't it a gorgeous day, Mr. Sun?
"
,,
1,2,"It's always a nice day
"
,,
1,2,"with two scoops of raisins, Peter.
"
,,
1,2," Top of the morning, everybody.
"
,,
1,2," Excellent!
"
,,
1,2,"Thus completes the penultimate
"
,,
1,2,"adjustment to my weather control device!
"
,,
1,2,"Victory is... Release me at once!
"
,,
1,2,"Your mother was right. It'd be a crime
"
,,
1,2,"to sit around and wait for the TV.
"
,,
1,2," Great. You can teach me how to drive.
"
,,
1,2," There'll be time to drive when you're dead.
"
,,
1,2,"There's a world out there waiting
"
,,
1,2,"for us to grab it by the short hairs!
"
,,
1,2," Damn!
"
,,
1,2," Let's go.
"
,,
1,2,"I'm so tired. This morning's fly-fishing
"
,,
1,2,"really wore me out.
"
,,
1,2,"Wake up! You promised you'd get
"
,,
1,2,"this hook out of my mouth.
"
,,
1,2,"Thank you.
"
,,
1,2,"Now, kids, your father's just trying
"
,,
1,2,"to spend time with his family.
"
,,
1,2,"Or kill us. I'm not sure which.
"
,,
1,2,"The Chinese sure like to spit,
"
,,
1,2,"don't they?
"
,,
1,2,"Diane, that last report was so good,
"
,,
1,2,"I think you deserve a spanking.
"
,,
1,2,"I don't think your wife
"
,,
1,2,"would appreciate that.
"
,,
1,2,"That frigid old cow lives in Quahog.
"
,,
1,2,"She can't hear a word I'm saying.
"
,,
1,2,"Actually, we're back on the air in Quahog.
"
,,
1,2,"Thank God!
"
,,
1,2,"Their puerile minds are once again
"
,,
1,2,"distracted by that flickering box.
"
,,
1,2,"Time to be bad!
"
,,
1,2,"Come on, everyone.
"
,,
1,2,"We're late for the Bavarian Folk Festival.
"
,,
1,2,"You know those Germans.
"
,,
1,2,"You don't join their party,
"
,,
1,2,"they come get you.
"
,,
1,2,"But Dad, the TV's back on.
"
,,
1,2,"What do you know? Okay, let's go.
"
,,
1,2,"Peter, I'm thrilled that you want to spend
"
,,
1,2,"so much time with the family.
"
,,
1,2,"But we're exhausted.
"
,,
1,2,"Maybe we could just sit
"
,,
1,2,"and watch some TV together?
"
,,
1,2,"We're too busy living life to the fullest.
"
,,
1,2,"Come on, let's go.
"
,,
1,2," I'm sick of life.
"
,,
1,2," Yeah. My dogs are barking.
"
,,
1,2," But I thought we were having fun.
"
,,
1,2," We were.
"
,,
1,2,"But now it might be nice to watch
"
,,
1,2,"other people have fun or get killed.
"
,,
1,2," You know, whatever's on.
"
,,
1,2," Look, Peter. It's your favorite show.
"
,,
1,2,"This is a dangerous mission.
"
,,
1,2,"And it's likely one of us will be killed.
"
,,
1,2,"The landing party will consist of myself,
"
,,
1,2,"Mr. Spock, Dr. McCoy, and Ensign Rickey.
"
,,
1,2,"Crap.
"
,,
1,2,"Sorry, Lois.
"
,,
1,2,"There's only one show I want to see.
"
,,
1,2,"It's called...
"
,,
1,2,"...Make Every Day Count,
"
,,
1,2,"starring Peter Griffin as himself.
"
,,
1,2,"Come on, Peter.
"
,,
1,2,"Don't you miss TV just a little?
"
,,
1,2,"The familiar stories, the broadly drawn
"
,,
1,2,"characters, the convenient plot turns...
"
,,
1,2,"...that bring a character around
"
,,
1,2,"at exactly the right moment?
"
,,
1,2,"Hi. I'm William Shatner.
"
,,
1,2,"My car broke down...
"
,,
1,2,"...on my way to give a speech
"
,,
1,2,"on how TV keeps families together.
"
,,
1,2,"Would you like to hear it?
"
,,
1,2,"No, I don't want to miss
"
,,
1,2,"the all-you-can-eat schnitzel bar.
"
,,
1,2,"Wait a minute! I love schnitzel!
"
,,
1,2,"Come along. I bet you could squeeze
"
,,
1,2,"into Lois' lederhosen.
"
,,
1,2,"I'll change in the car.
"
,,
1,2,"If I had a nickel for every time
"
,,
1,2,"one of my parents walked out...
"
,,
1,2,"...instead of teaching me how to drive,
"
,,
1,2,"I'd be one rich little...
"
,,
1,2,"Let's go, Meg.
"
,,
1,2,"Fare thee well, broccoli!
"
,,
1,2,"I don't know. I can't imagine
"
,,
1,2,"choosing life over television.
"
,,
1,2,"I'm telling you, it's great, Bill.
"
,,
1,2,"The only thing that would make this
"
,,
1,2,"perfect day better is if my family was here.
"
,,
1,2,"My God!
"
,,
1,2,"It was sunny a moment ago,
"
,,
1,2,"but now it's pouring!
"
,,
1,2,"Let's take off our shoes
"
,,
1,2,"and run home barefoot!
"
,,
1,2,"Griffin, you're a madman!
"
,,
1,2,"Barefoot, you say?
"
,,
1,2,"This is not safe.
"
,,
1,2,"I'll teach you how to drive some other time.
"
,,
1,2,"Pull over.
"
,,
1,2,"Mom, I can't even tell where ""over"" is.
"
,,
1,2,"You were right, Peter.
"
,,
1,2,"I've never felt so alive.
"
,,
1,2,"Victory is mine!
"
,,
1,2,"God damn it.
"
,,
1,2,"My God.
"
,,
1,2,"My God. I hit William Shatner.
"
,,
1,2,"Light growing dimmer.
"
,,
1,2,"Can't breathe. Beam me up, God.
"
,,
1,2,"I did not see that coming.
"
,,
1,2,"Daddy, I'm sorry I ran you over
"
,,
1,2,"and killed Mr. Shatner.
"
,,
1,2,"Don't worry. Once I'm of this body cast,
"
,,
1,2,"I'll do enough living for me and Bill.
"
,,
1,2,"Honey, can't we go back
"
,,
1,2,"to the way things used to be?
"
,,
1,2,"There's a big dent in that couch
"
,,
1,2,"that nobody else can fill.
"
,,
1,2,"Haven't you guys learned anything?
"
,,
1,2,"TV took over my life once.
"
,,
1,2,"I'm never gonna let that happen again.
"
,,
1,2,"My God.
"
,,
1,2,"We've lost him.
"
,,
1,2,"If you help me out of here,
"
,,
1,2,"I know a meadow where...
"
,,
1,2,"...the blueberries are begging to be picked.
"
,,
1,2,"Look, buddy. Just go in the pan.
"
,,
1,2,"And don't call me unless you're flatlining.
"
,,
1,2,"Turn that TV off. Nurse?
"
,,
1,2,"What would you do
"
,,
1,2,"for a Klondike Bar?
"
,,
1,2,"Would you stand on one leg?
"
,,
1,2,"Sure.
"
,,
1,2,"Would you act like a monkey?
"
,,
1,2,"Would you kill a man?
"
,,
1,2,"Daddy, now that I've finally passed
"
,,
1,2,"my driver's test...
"
,,
1,2,"...can I still get a convertible?
"
,,
1,2,"No. But I'm proud of you
"
,,
1,2,"for getting your license, sweetheart.
"
,,
1,2,"And I'm proud of you, Peter.
"
,,
1,2,"You taught us all a valuable lesson.
"
,,
1,2,"It's not what you do
"
,,
1,2,"that defines the quality of your life...
"
,,
1,2,"...it's who you do it with, and your family...
"
,,
1,2,"It's on.
"
,,
1,2,"I know you don't like broccoli, Stewie,
"
,,
1,2,"but you'll thank me...
"
,,
1,2,"...when you grow up big and strong
"
,,
1,2,"like your father.
"
,,
1,2,"A compelling argument.
"
,,
1,2,"You've swayed me, woman.
"
,,
1,2,"That is good. I feel stronger already.
"
,,
1,2,"It's good tasting and good for you.
"
,,
1,2,"Nice try.

"

1,3,"Yeah. I'll never forget the day he was born.
"

1,3,"One more push, Lois.
"

1,3,"This is a miracle, Mr. Griffin.
"

1,3,"Would you like to see?
"

1,3,"Yeah, I've never actually seen

1,3,"a baby being... Oh, God!

"

1,3,"I don't think we're through.
"

1,3,"Oh, my God! Is it twins?
"

1,3,"No. It's a map of Europe.
"
,,
1,3,"I confirmed everything
"
,,
1,3,"with the birthday party planner...
"
,,
1,3,"...at Cheesie Charlie's.
"
,,
1,3," Why Cheesie Charlie's?
"
,,
1,3," It's cool, Dad.
"
,,
1,3,"They have this game where you put in
"

1,3,"a dollar and you win four quarters!
"
,,
1,3,"I win every time! I get to go, right?
"
,,
1,3,"Why can't we have
"
,,
1,3,"the same kind of party we always do?
"
,,
1,3,"Peter, this could be
"
,,
1,3,"our last first birthday ever.
"
,,
1,3,"When Meg and Chris turned one,
"
,,
1,3,"I had so much to do, I missed everything.
"
,,
1,3,"Lois, you won't believe this!
"
,,
1,3,"Meg just said ""Da-Da!""
"
,,
1,3,"Her first words?
"
,,
1,3,"Then she stood up by herself
"
,,
1,3,"and started walking!
"
,,
1,3," Her first steps?
"
,,
1,3," Yeah.
"
,,
1,3,"What the hell are you doing
"
,,
1,3,"in here anyway?
"
,,
1,3,"All right! Her first drum solo.
"
,,
1,3,"Thanks to Cheesie Charlie...
"
,,
1,3,"...I'm not gonna miss a moment
"
,,
1,3,"of Stewie's party.
"
,,
1,3,"I say, am I to spend the entire day
"
,,
1,3,"wallowing around in my own feces?
"
,,
1,3,"A little service here!
"
,,
1,3,"Hey, Stinky.
"
,,
1,3,"Have we got some big plans for you.
"
,,
1,3,"Plans? What the devil
"
,,
1,3,"are you talking about?
"
,,
1,3,"It's your birthday, dude.
"
,,
1,3,"Saturday's gonna be real special, honey.
"
,,
1,3,"I've hired a professional
"
,,
1,3,"to make sure everything goes just right.
"
,,
1,3,"A professional? There's treachery afoot!
"
,,
1,3,"Meg, you're home late.
"
,,
1,3,"I stayed after school
"
,,
1,3,"to try out for cheerleading.
"
,,
1,3,"Don't keep me in suspense.
"
,,
1,3,"How'd you do?
"
,,
1,3,"I'll give you a hint.
"

1,3,"I S-U-C-K-E-D! Sucked!
"
,,
1,3,"Yay!
"
,,
1,3,"I mean, sorry, honey.
"
,,
1,3,"God, I hate high school.
"
,,
1,3,"I don't fit in with anyone.
"
,,
1,3,"Boy. Do I know that feeling.
"
,,
1,3,"Okay, man. Okay.
"
,,
1,3,"You are really throwing me off.
"
,,
1,3,"It's step-kick, step-twirl. Got it?
"
,,
1,3,"I thought we were gonna rumble
"
,,
1,3,"with those greasy Sharks.
"
,,
1,3,"Not without seven years of ballet
"
,,
1,3,"and two of jazz tap, we're not.
"
,,
1,3,"From the top, people!
"
,,
1,3,"Why don't you just hang back and stretch?
"
,,
1,3,"I don't get it.
"
,,
1,3,"The more I try to make friends,
"
,,
1,3,"the more people hate me.
"
,,
1,3,"Listen. You're a one-of-a-kind girl
"
,,
1,3,"with a mind of her own.
"
,,
1,3," Now, see, that's what people hate.
"
,,
1,3," Really?
"
,,
1,3,"I'm telling you, just be the girl
"
,,
1,3,"you think everyone else wants you to be.
"
,,
1,3,"Wow, it's so obvious.
"
,,
1,3,"Thanks, Daddy.
"
,,
1,3,"Hi, Mom. Bye, Mom.
"
,,
1,3,"I haven't seen Meg this happy
"
,,
1,3,"since that bus broke down...
"
,,
1,3,"...in front of our house.
"
,,
1,3,"Hi. Can we use your phone?
"
,,
1,3,"Holy crap! It's The Children of the Corn!
"
,,
1,3," Meg and I had a little father-daughter talk.
"
,,
1,3," It seems to have worked.
"
,,
1,3,"I wasn't just blowing smoke
"
,,
1,3,"when I bought this T-shirt.
"
,,
1,3,"Well, you're the number-one husband, too.

,,
1,3,"I know. That's why I bought this T-shirt.

1,3,"Let's throw up.

1,3,"Now your mom is counting on us

1,3,"to drop off the deposit.
"

1,3,"So let's just deliver the check and...

,,
1,3,"Hong Kong Phooey!
"
,,
1,3,"Yeah! Come on! Go, yeah! Eat my dust!
"
,,
1,3,"Come on, move it! Oh, man!
"
,,
1,3,"Chris, this place is great.
"
,,
1,3,"Pull over, you bastard!
"
,,
1,3,"Man.
"
,,
1,3,"Hey, Dad, they even got games
"
,,
1,3,"in the bathroom. Look, I won a balloon!
"
,,
1,3,"Yeah, way to go, Chris.
"
,,
1,3,"Where's my watch?
"
,,
1,3,"All right. I won a watch.
"
,,
1,3,"What's The Dukes of Hazzard?
"
,,
1,3,"That's mine. Come on.
"
,,
1,3,"Come on, give that back!

,,
1,3," Give it!
"
,,
1,3," Come on!
"
,,
1,3,"Folks in Hazzard County
"
,,
1,3,"hadn't seen a watch fight in a long time.

1,3,"Them boys rassled for a full five minutes

1,3,"Come on!
"
,,
1,3,"Hands off, fatty!
"
,,
1,3,"Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
"
,,
1,3,"I'm a paying customer.
"
,,
1,3,"I got a deposit check
"
,,
1,3,"for my kid's party right here.
"
,,
1,3,"Mr. Griffin. I am terribly sorry.
"
,,
1,3,"We're really looking forward
"
,,
1,3,"to Stewie's special day.
"
,,
1,3,"Now I don't know,
"
,,
1,3,"after the emotional trauma I've endured...
"
,,
1,3,"...on your premises,
"
,,
1,3,"I think I deserve a little discount.
"
,,
1,3,"Sir, our prices are set
"
,,
1,3,"by the corporate office.
"
,,
1,3,"Then maybe I'll just take
"
,,
1,3,"my business elsewhere.
"
,,
1,3,"Good luck filling our spot by this Saturday.
"
,,
1,3,"I got cash!
"
,,
1,3,"I'll take it!
"
,,
1,3,"Suit yourself.
"
,,
1,3,"Wait. I was just bluffing.
"
,,
1,3,"My wife has her heart set on this place.
"
,,
1,3,"Chris, this is a big day for you.
"
,,
1,3,"The day you become the man of the house.
"
,,
1,3,"Because when we get home,
"
,,
1,3,"your mother is going to kill me.
"
,,
1,3,"So the man in white is coming
"
,,
1,3,"to put me back in the womb, is he?
"
,,
1,3,"If I'm to defeat him,
"
,,
1,3,"I shall require professional forces.
"
,,
1,3,"Here we are. ""Come to Managua,
"
,,
1,3,"the Mecca of mercenaries. ""
"
,,
1,3,"I must prepare for my journey.
"
,,
1,3,"Let's see.
"
,,
1,3,"Grenades, mace, baggy full of Cheerios...
"
,,
1,3," So, are we all set at Cheesie Charlie's?
"
,,
1,3," Actually, I canceled the reservation.
"
,,
1,3,"What?
"
,,
1,3," How could you?
"
,,
1,3," Lois, I got a very good reason.
"
,,
1,3,"Wait a second.
"
,,
1,3,"These are always classic.
"
,,
1,3,"Lois, that Cheesie Charlie's is no good.
"
,,
1,3,"See, it happened like this.
"
,,
1,3,"Welcome to Cheesie Charlie's. Heil, Hitler!
"
,,
1,3,"Actually, the name's Griffin.
"
,,
1,3,"I was sent by my smart, beautiful,
"
,,
1,3,"and still sexually appealing wife, Lois.
"
,,
1,3,"Yes.
"
,,
1,3,"We're all set for your little boy's party.
"
,,
1,3,"I understand we're getting
"
,,
1,3,"a terrific bargain here.
"
,,
1,3,"Absolutely.
"
,,
1,3,"The children get to play our games.
"
,,
1,3,"And if they win enough tickets,
"
,,
1,3,"they get a prize.
"
,,
1,3,"I have 13 tickets now. Is that enough?
"
,,
1,3,"Sorry, Timmy.
"
,,
1,3,"But you need 15 tickets to live.
"
,,
1,3,"They also get food, cake,
"
,,
1,3,"and your choice of ice-cream flavors...
"
,,
1,3,"...vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, or people.
"
,,
1,3," What was that?
"
,,
1,3," Chocolate. Give me the check.
"
,,
1,3,"Hold it! Lois may have
"
,,
1,3,"had her heart set on this place...
"
,,
1,3,"...but I love my family too much
"
,,
1,3,"to risk their lives.
"
,,
1,3," Come on, Chris. We're leaving.
"
,,
1,3," No, you're not!
"
,,
1,3,"Please don't make me angry, pal.
"
,,
1,3,"You wouldn't like me when I'm angry.
"
,,
1,3,"All right, Peter. That's enough!
"
,,
1,3,"Bravo, Peter.
"
,,
1,3,"You are the Spalding Gray of crap.
"
,,
1,3,"Do you know how hard it was
"
,,
1,3,"to get a reservation at Cheesie Charlie's?
"
,,
1,3,"I had to book it the day of my ultrasound.
"
,,
1,3,"We'll never find another place in time!
"
,,
1,3,"For once, it was all gonna be so perfect!
"
,,
1,3,"Come on, Lois. It'll still be perfect.
"
,,
1,3,"We'll give him the best birthday ever...
"
,,
1,3,"...right here in the safety and comfort
"
,,
1,3,"of our own home.
"
,,
1,3," Peter, we've been over this.
"
,,
1,3," Honey, you won't have to lift a finger.
"
,,
1,3,"I got us a clown, a cake, a petting zoo,
"
,,
1,3,"a big-ass piata, the works!
"
,,
1,3," You got all those things?
"
,,
1,3," You bet I did.
"
,,
1,3,"Wow.
"
,,
1,3,"Even Cheesie Charlie's doesn't have
"
,,
1,3,"a petting zoo.
"
,,
1,3,"Okay, I'll call the parents
"
,,
1,3,"and let them know the party's here.
"
,,
1,3," You don't have any of those things.
"
,,
1,3," How do you know?
"
,,
1,3,"Face it. You're a terrible liar.
"
,,
1,3,"It was you.
"
,,
1,3,"Clowns and petting zoos
"
,,
1,3,"book months in advance.
"
,,
1,3,"You're gonna have a tough time finding a...
"
,,
1,3,"Hold on.
"
,,
1,3,"Ya! Ya!
"
,,
1,3,"Some day.
"
,,
1,3,"Hey there, little boy. Are you lost?
"
,,
1,3,"Now, listen to me, Jolene.
"
,,
1,3,"I've got an army to raise,
"
,,
1,3,"and I must get to Nicaragua.
"
,,
1,3,"I require a window seat and
"
,,
1,3,"an in-flight Happy Meal. And no pickles!
"
,,
1,3," God help you if I find pickles.
"
,,
1,3," Henry, I have a lost little boy.
"
,,
1,3,"Hey there, little fella.
"
,,
1,3,"Why don't you come with me?
"
,,
1,3,"Damn you!
"
,,
1,3,"You're one of them, aren't you?
"
,,
1,3,"What are they paying you? I'll double it!
"
,,
1,3,"I'll give you whatever you want!
"
,,
1,3,"Money! Women! Men?
"
,,
1,3,"Dad, what are we doing here again?
"
,,
1,3,"Pigs, Chris.
"
,,
1,3,"We're getting pigs for Stewie's petting zoo.
"
,,
1,3,"Crafty swine.
"
,,
1,3,"UPS.
"
,,
1,3,"Little bastards ain't as smart as...
"
,,
1,3,"Hi, Mom. This is Jennifer.
"
,,
1,3,"She gave me a ride home.
"
,,
1,3,"Meg, you made a friend.
"
,,
1,3,"What a lovely house, Mrs. G.
"
,,
1,3,"Meg, you didn't tell me
"
,,
1,3,"your mother was just like Martha Stewart.
"
,,
1,3,"Oh, no. Once you get to know me,
"
,,
1,3,"I'm really very nice.
"
,,
1,3,"You know what's nice?
"
,,
1,3,"Having a friend like Meg. And kittens.
"
,,
1,3,"It was super swell meeting you.
"
,,
1,3,"Bye, Meg. Friends forever.
"
,,
1,3,"Forever and ever.
"
,,
1,3,"Wow! What a great yard!
"
,,
1,3,"Guess what, Mom?
"
,,
1,3,"Jennifer invited me to a party on Saturday.
"
,,
1,3,"This Saturday?
"
,,
1,3,"Meg, you can't miss Stewie's first birthday.
"
,,
1,3,"But Mom...
"
,,
1,3,"Meg, our entire family is
"
,,
1,3,"going to be here for Stewie's party.
"
,,
1,3,"And that includes you. Understood?
"
,,
1,3,"I can't believe you'd put your family
"
,,
1,3,"before your own daughter!
"
,,
1,3,"She's a whiny little runt, isn't she?
"
,,
1,3,"I said ""runt. ""
"
,,
1,3,"I don't think I'm in the right place.
"
,,
1,3,"I'm looking for a guy to entertain
"
,,
1,3,"the kids at my son's birthday.
"
,,
1,3,"Sure. I can do that.
"
,,
1,3,"You do children's parties?
"
,,
1,3,"Yeah. I can do, like, a handstand,
"
,,
1,3,"and some somersaults maybe.
"
,,
1,3,"I can make pretend like
"
,,
1,3,"the children are little bugs in my web.
"
,,
1,3,"Do you know your phone number, son?
"
,,
1,3,"The only way you'll get me to talk
"
,,
1,3,"is through slow, painful torture.
"
,,
1,3,"And I don't think you've got the grapes!
"
,,
1,3,"It sounds like you don't want to go home.
"
,,
1,3,"Are you running away?
"
,,
1,3,"Stewart Gilligan Griffin runs from nothing!
"
,,
1,3,"You know, son,
"
,,
1,3,"running away never solves anything.
"
,,
1,3,"You're getting to be a big boy now.
"
,,
1,3,"And part of growing up means
"
,,
1,3,"facing your problems head on.
"
,,
1,3,"The ruptured capillaries in your nose belie
"
,,
1,3,"the clarity of your wisdom.
"
,,
1,3,"You're saying I must return
"
,,
1,3,"to face this man in white myself. So be it.
"
,,
1,3,"As for you, kind sage, I only hope
"
,,
1,3,"my heartfelt thanks will keep you warm...
"
,,
1,3,"...as you spend the next 10 years
"
,,
1,3,"in frozen carbonite!
"
,,
1,3,"Peter, you've only got
"
,,
1,3,"a couple of hours left.
"
,,
1,3,"If you pull a party out of your ass,
"
,,
1,3,"you'll want to stand up.
"
,,
1,3,"My friend Jennifer invited me
"
,,
1,3,"to hang out with her friends.
"
,,
1,3,"Can I go?
"
,,
1,3,"I won't fall for this trick.
"
,,
1,3,"Did you ask your mother?
"
,,
1,3,"Yes.
"
,,
1,3,"Okay, then. Have fun, sweetheart.
"
,,
1,3,"Thanks, Daddy!
"
,,
1,3,"Brian, Stewie's birthday is gonna suck.
"
,,
1,3,"The only stuff I could get on such short
"
,,
1,3,"notice was a cake and that big-ass piata.
"
,,
1,3,"I sure hope candy comes out of that.
"
,,
1,3,"Face it, Brian. I'm a bad father,
"
,,
1,3,"a lousy husband, and a snappy dresser.
"
,,
1,3,"I'll never be able to face Lois.
"
,,
1,3,"The circus is in town.
"
,,
1,3,"Maybe you could run away and join it.
"
,,
1,3,"The circus!
"
,,
1,3,"Hi. This is the right day, isn't it?
"
,,
1,3,"Oh, yes. Peter should be back any minute...
"
,,
1,3,"...and then we can start the party, I hope.
"
,,
1,3,"Hey, Lois, look.
"
,,
1,3,"The two symbols of the Republican party...
"
,,
1,3,"...an elephant and a big fat white guy
"
,,
1,3,"who's threatened by change.
"
,,
1,3,"Peter, this is the most wonderful
"
,,
1,3,"celebration I could have imagined.
"
,,
1,3,"Yeah. Where's Stewie?
"
,,
1,3,"He's upstairs, resting up for his big day.
"
,,
1,3,"I'll get him. If you see Meg,
"
,,
1,3,"tell her to take plenty of pictures.
"
,,
1,3,"Meg's not here.
"
,,
1,3,"She went to a friend's house.
"
,,
1,3,"What?
"
,,
1,3,"She's gonna miss Stewie's birthday.
"
,,
1,3,"I dropped her off an hour ago.
"
,,
1,3,"Boy, is she gonna be sorry, or what?
"
,,
1,3,"Peter. How could you let her go?
"
,,
1,3,"What's the big deal?
"
,,
1,3,"So Meg's with her new friends.
"
,,
1,3,"They seemed like some nice kids.
"
,,
1,3,"I'm glad you could join us.
"
,,
1,3,"We're gonna have a great time on our trip.
"
,,
1,3,"A trip? Like to the beach?
"
,,
1,3,"Because I didn't bring my swimsuit.
"
,,
1,3,"You won't need anything
"
,,
1,3,"where we're going.
"
,,
1,3,"Excuse me. I've gotta go mix the punch.
"
,,
1,3,"Birthday dude?
"
,,
1,3,"Do you want some ice cream?
"
,,
1,3,"Yes. But no sprinkles!
"
,,
1,3,"For every sprinkle I find, I shall kill you!
"
,,
1,3,"Come on, Lois. I hate to see you so upset.
"
,,
1,3,"We got animals. We got clowns.
"
,,
1,3,"I mean, a party couldn't be any better
"
,,
1,3,"if Jesus himself showed up.
"
,,
1,3,"Okay, everybody. For my next miracle,
"
,,
1,3,"I'm gonna turn water into funk.
"
,,
1,3,"Peter, the circus is terrific.
"
,,
1,3,"But it's not just Stewie's birthday.
"
,,
1,3,"We're also celebrating the day
"
,,
1,3,"our family became whole.
"
,,
1,3,"Today means nothing if Meg isn't here.
"
,,
1,3,"Meg, you seem sad. Today's a happy day.
"
,,
1,3,"I know. It's just that
"
,,
1,3,"I really like that guy over there.
"
,,
1,3,"But he doesn't even know I exist.
"
,,
1,3,"He must think I'm a total dog.
"
,,
1,3,"That is so not true.
"
,,
1,3,"Then what is it?
"
,,
1,3," He's a eunuch.
"
,,
1,3," Really?
"
,,
1,3,"Sure. All the guys here
"
,,
1,3,"have been castrated.
"
,,
1,3,"It's cool.
"
,,
1,3," Do you think that girl is hot?
"
,,
1,3," No.
"
,,
1,3,"Me neither.
"
,,
1,3,"Hey, you. Hit me.
"
,,
1,3,"There. Now, if I can just find a midget
"
,,
1,3,"with some gin, I'll be in business.
"
,,
1,3,"Where are you off to?
"
,,
1,3,"I gotta make things right for Lois
"
,,
1,3,"and get this monkey off my back.
"
,,
1,3,"Ow! Knock it off!
"
,,
1,3,"All right, men, the man in white
"
,,
1,3,"is coming to put me back in the womb.
"
,,
1,3,"Today he comes for me,
"
,,
1,3,"but tomorrow it could be you or you!
"
,,
1,3,"I offer you the opportunity to join me
"
,,
1,3,"in glorious battle.
"
,,
1,3,"I know that for some of you,
"
,,
1,3,"your motor skills are not developed.
"
,,
1,3,"Sadly, you will be used as decoys.
"
,,
1,3,"But your children's children
"
,,
1,3,"will know that you fell for a noble cause.
"
,,
1,3,"Now, who's with me?
"
,,
1,3,"Duckie?
"
,,
1,3,"Useless, every one of you! Fine.
"
,,
1,3,"I'll defend myself,
"
,,
1,3,"and the hell with all of you!
"
,,
1,3,"There, I've gone and soiled myself.
"
,,
1,3,"Are you happy now?
"
,,
1,3,"Our leader is here
"
,,
1,3,"to take us on our journey!
"
,,
1,3,"My children, rejoice. The hour
"
,,
1,3,"of transformation is close at hand.
"
,,
1,3,"Who are you?
"
,,
1,3,"This is Meg, wise one.
"
,,
1,3,"Can she come with us?
"
,,
1,3,"Perhaps. Do you have a mind
"
,,
1,3,"that seeks enlightenment...
"
,,
1,3,"...and a heart that seeks purity?
"
,,
1,3,"Not really.
"
,,
1,3,"Okay. Are you a confused adolescent
"
,,
1,3,"desperately seeking acceptance...
"
,,
1,3,"...from an undifferentiated ego mass
"
,,
1,3,"that demands conformity?
"
,,
1,3,"Wow, that sort of sounds more like me.
"
,,
1,3,"Great! Then all you need is
"
,,
1,3,"a dark-blue jogging suit.
"
,,
1,3,"Let's see what we have in stock.
"
,,
1,3,"What are you? About a 9?
"
,,
1,3,"No. A 6.
"
,,
1,3,"Right. Dispense the refreshments.
"
,,
1,3,"Meg, there you are.
"
,,
1,3,"Dad, what are you doing here?
"
,,
1,3,"I'm so embarrassed, I could die!
"
,,
1,3,"Not before the rest of us!
"
,,
1,3,"Meg, your mother wants
"
,,
1,3,"the family together today.
"
,,
1,3,"It's just Stewie's birthday.
"
,,
1,3,"So what if I'm not there?
"
,,
1,3,"Who's gonna remember?
"
,,
1,3,"Your mom will, trust me.
"
,,
1,3,"She remembers everything.
"
,,
1,3,"In fact, she always says the best memories
"
,,
1,3,"she has are when you kids were born.
"
,,
1,3,"Meg, that's it. This day is more
"
,,
1,3,"for your mom than it is for Stewie.
"
,,
1,3,"With all she's given us,
"
,,
1,3,"she oughta get whatever she wants.
"
,,
1,3,"And, Meg, today she wants you
"
,,
1,3,"to be with the family.
"
,,
1,3,"Really?
"
,,
1,3,"Daddy, you must think
"
,,
1,3,"I'm the worst daughter ever.
"
,,
1,3,"No you're not, honey.
"
,,
1,3,"What about that fat girl from the Judds?
"
,,
1,3,"I'm sorry I've been so selfish.
"
,,
1,3,"I miss my mom.
"
,,
1,3,"Me, too.
"
,,
1,3,"I also miss my nads.
"
,,
1,3,"Mr. Griffin, can we come
"
,,
1,3,"to Stewie's party, too?
"
,,
1,3,"Sure. The more the merrier.
"
,,
1,3,"Meg, you have the coolest family.
"
,,
1,3,"She sure does.
"
,,
1,3,"Here's to family!
"
,,
1,3,"To family!
"
,,
1,3,"Jeez, look at the time! Come on.
"
,,
1,3,"Come on, kids. Let's get going.
"
,,
1,3,"Sorry, Meg.
"
,,
1,3,"It's another bunch of people
"
,,
1,3,"that'd rather fake death...
"
,,
1,3,"...than go to a party with you.
"
,,
1,3,"Children, the time of ascension has arrived.
"
,,
1,3,"For the love of God. Haven't any of you
"
,,
1,3,"ever been in a cult before?
"
,,
1,3,"Damn it!
"
,,
1,3,"I can't achieve transcendence by myself.
"
,,
1,3,"That would just make me
"
,,
1,3,"some kind of lone nut.
"
,,
1,3,"Somebody's got to die with me.
"
,,
1,3,"Come back, Meg!
"
,,
1,3,"Whoops. Can't forget
"
,,
1,3,"my ceremonial white robe.
"
,,
1,3,"I guess there's nothing left
"
,,
1,3,"but the birthday cake.
"
,,
1,3,"Right here!
"
,,
1,3,"Meg!
"
,,
1,3,"I'm sorry, Mom.
"
,,
1,3,"Thank you, Peter.
"
,,
1,3,"No problem.
"
,,
1,3,"I cannot wait to taste this cake.
"
,,
1,3,"The guy who sold it to me
"
,,
1,3,"said it was delicious and erotic.
"
,,
1,3,"Peter, there's a naked man on this cake.
"
,,
1,3,"There were only two left.
"
,,
1,3,"And trust me, you did not want the one
"
,,
1,3,"of Al Roker with the Hershey Kiss nipples.
"
,,
1,3,"Gather round, everyone.
"
,,
1,3,"It's time for Stewie's big moment.
"
,,
1,3,"Hello?
"
,,
1,3,"Is anybody home?
"
,,
1,3,"Greetings, man in white.
"
,,
1,3,"I've been expecting you.
"
,,
1,3,"Who said that?
"
,,
1,3,"Peek-a-boo! I see you!
"
,,
1,3,"You're getting warmer.
"
,,
1,3,"Where are you? What do you want?
"
,,
1,3,"Freedom! What do you want?
"
,,
1,3,"I want to get the hell out of here!
"
,,
1,3,"I'm sorry. We're fresh out of that.
"
,,
1,3,"I'm afraid all that's left is untimely death.
"
,,
1,3,"What the hell is this?
"
,,
1,3,"It's a boy!
"
,,
1,3,"Anybody seen Stewie?
"
,,
1,3,"Yeah. Where is the birthday boy?
"
,,
1,3,"Victory is mine!
"
,,
1,3,"Yes. And this cake is yours, too.
"
,,
1,3,"Stewie, make a wish.
"
,,
1,3,"If you blow out the candle, it'll come true.
"
,,
1,3,"That's right, little buddy. What do you
"
,,
1,3,"want most in the whole world?
"
,,
1,3,"In the whole world, you say?
"
,,
1,3,"What the hell.

1,4,"And I wish you were because we're out.
"
,,
1,4,"That's funny. That's even more humorous
"
,,
1,4,"than that joke you told us last night.
"
,,
1,4,"Okay, so a Jewish guy and a Chinese guy
"
,,
1,4,"walk into a bar, right?
"
,,
1,4,"Wait a second.
"
,,
1,4,"Jewish guy and a Chinese guy
"
,,
1,4,"walk into a bar.
"
,,
1,4,"And there's a naked priest sitting there.
"

1,4,"And he...
"

1,4,"Oh, sorry, Father.
"
,,
1,4,"No, I've heard them all.
"
,,
1,4,"Look at the time.
"
,,
1,4,"I promised Loretta I was gonna trim
"
,,
1,4,"the hedges and be tender with her.
"
,,
1,4,"Believe me, Cleveland. Our wives need
"
,,
1,4,"some time off as much as we do.
"
,,
1,4,"This is when Lois does all those
"
,,
1,4,"little things that women like to do.
"
,,
1,4,"I'll be on your bed. No calls.
"
,,
1,4,"Hey, Lois.
"
,,
1,4,"You've been busy all day.
"
,,
1,4,"So I took care of dinner.
"
,,
1,4,"Really?
"
,,
1,4,"All you gotta do is gut it, clean it,
"
,,
1,4,"scale it, and cook it.
"
,,
1,4,"I spent all morning
"
,,
1,4,"cleaning up the house.
"
,,
1,4,"And in five seconds,
"
,,
1,4,"you turn it into low tide at the pier.
"
,,
1,4,"Jeez. I'm sorry, honey.
"
,,
1,4,"I'd help you clean it up.
"
,,
1,4,"But you know how lousy
"
,,
1,4,"I am with housework.
"
,,
1,4,"Remember when I tried doing the laundry?
"
,,
1,4,"Let's see. Shirts, pants...
"
,,
1,4,"I'm missing another sock.
"
,,
1,4,"Welcome to Narnia. I'm Mr. Tumnus.
"
,,
1,4,"Give me back my sock, you goat bastard!
"
,,
1,4,"Hey!
"
,,
1,4,"You're right. It's better if I do it.
"
,,
1,4,"Damn it to the bowels
"
,,
1,4,"of bloody hell!
"
,,
1,4,"The baby's up. Can you get him?
"
,,
1,4,"Okay. I hope he doesn't need changing.
"
,,
1,4,"I'm a little gun-shy
"
,,
1,4,"after what happened last time.
"
,,
1,4,"No, you imbecile!
"
,,
1,4,"That's not talc! That's paprika!
"
,,
1,4,"Take that!
"
,,
1,4,"All right, I'll do that, too!
"
,,
1,4,"Can you at least take Chris to his game?
"
,,
1,4,"Jeez, Lois. I spent all morning on a boat...
"
,,
1,4,"...drinking beer, telling jokes,
"
,,
1,4,"and screwing around.
"
,,
1,4,"How about a little me time?
"
,,
1,4,"Honey, I'm begging you.
"
,,
1,4,"Drop Chris off at his soccer game...
"
,,
1,4,"...and come right home.
"
,,
1,4,"I need you to look after Stewie
"
,,
1,4,"while I'm teaching piano lessons, please!
"
,,
1,4,"All right! You know I spoil you.
"
,,
1,4,"Thanks for the ride, Dad.
"
,,
1,4,"All right. Have fun, Chris.
"
,,
1,4,"Hey, Petey!
"
,,
1,4,"Quagmire? What are you doing here?
"
,,
1,4,"Soccer moms!
"
,,
1,4,"All right.
"
,,
1,4,"I'd like to hang around with you.
"
,,
1,4,"But Lois needs me at home.
"
,,
1,4,"I got beer.
"
,,
1,4,"Boo, Lois! Yay, beer!
"
,,
1,4,"It's okay, Stewie. Where the hell's Peter?
"
,,
1,4,"That was good, Reuben.
"
,,
1,4,"Now play Brahms' Lullaby.
"
,,
1,4,"""Lullaby and good night""
"
,,
1,4,"Enough! The only thing worse
"
,,
1,4,"than the wretched pain...
"
,,
1,4,"...in my mouth is the excrement
"
,,
1,4,"spewing from yours!
"
,,
1,4,"I wish I could make the pain
"
,,
1,4,"go away sooner.
"
,,
1,4,"But I can't turn time forward.
"
,,
1,4,"Oh, no! Perhaps I can! Of course!
"
,,
1,4,"I'll simply build a machine...
"
,,
1,4,"...that can move time!
"
,,
1,4,"I shall call it a time machine.
"
,,
1,4,"E-flat, Salieri! E-flat!
"
,,
1,4,"Go, Chris! Daddy loves you!
"
,,
1,4,"I mean in a platonic way. I'm married.
"
,,
1,4,"Hand ball! Penalty kick, blue!
"
,,
1,4,"That's the 10th time today!
"
,,
1,4,"Nice grab, orca.
"
,,
1,4,"Get Moby Dick off the field
"
,,
1,4,"before he burps up a license plate!
"
,,
1,4,"Easy, fella. That's my kid. Now apologize.
"
,,
1,4,"Okay. I'm sorry your kid's a brain dead
"
,,
1,4,"stinking blue cheese feta!
"
,,
1,4,"That's it!
"
,,
1,4,"Way to go, Dad!
"
,,
1,4,"You hit my mom!
"
,,
1,4,"No, I hit your dad.
"
,,
1,4,"Stand back. Give her some air.
"
,,
1,4,"You mean, ""Give him some air.""
"
,,
1,4,"Call an ambulance. She's going into labor.
"
,,
1,4,"You mean, ""He's going into labor.""
"
,,
1,4,"Whoops.
"
,,
1,4,"I can't believe I punched a woman.
"
,,
1,4,"A pregnant woman.
"
,,
1,4,"I just hope she accepts my peace offering.
"
,,
1,4,"I sent her a little something for the baby.
"
,,
1,4,"I would've brought it over myself
"
,,
1,4,"if I wasn't under house arrest.
"
,,
1,4,"You're just fortunate
"
,,
1,4,"this is your first offense, Peter.
"
,,
1,4,"Could've been a lot worse if the cops...
"
,,
1,4,"...knew about the other times
"
,,
1,4,"I broke the law.
"
,,
1,4,"And there was that time
"
,,
1,4,"I took a whiz in public.
"
,,
1,4,"And that time I snuck into Wimbledon.
"
,,
1,4,"And that time I snuck into Wimbledon.
"
,,
1,4,"Me and Cleveland are gonna ""amscray.""
"
,,
1,4,"Wait. You guys can't leave me here alone.
"
,,
1,4,"Why don't you come with us?
"
,,
1,4,"I can't leave the premises.
"
,,
1,4,"They're monitoring my every move.
"
,,
1,4,"I gotta get out of here!
"
,,
1,4,"There's my little house husband.
"
,,
1,4,"It's been so wonderful
"
,,
1,4,"having you home all week.
"
,,
1,4,"Thanks, honey.
"
,,
1,4,"But I don't know how you...
"
,,
1,4,"...stand it here all day.
"
,,
1,4,"I mean, I'm so bored,
"
,,
1,4,"I can't even watch TV anymore.
"
,,
1,4,"All the shows are starting to run together.
"
,,
1,4,"This contains adult content
"
,,
1,4,"and is brought to you by the letter ""H"".
"
,,
1,4,"Hello?
"
,,
1,4,"Son of a bitch. I'm on my way.
"
,,
1,4,"Some poor bastard got his head
"
,,
1,4,"blown off down at a place called Hooper's.
"
,,
1,4,"Bert, I wish
"
,,
1,4,"you wouldn't drink so much, Bert.
"
,,
1,4,"Well, Ernie, I wish you wouldn't eat
"
,,
1,4,"cookies in the damn bed!
"
,,
1,4,"Bert, you're shouting again, Bert!
"
,,
1,4,"I know you can't understand
"
,,
1,4,"what I'm going through.
"
,,
1,4,"All the stuff that makes you happy...
"
,,
1,4,"...like cooking and cleaning,
"
,,
1,4,"is right in the house just waiting for you.
"
,,
1,4," You are one lucky...
"
,,
1,4," Stop now.
"
,,
1,4,"Peter, I don't do those things
"
,,
1,4,"because I enjoy them.
"
,,
1,4,"I do them because I love my family.
"
,,
1,4,"Lois loves her family. Lois loves her family.

1,4,"See, Lois, the guys would've
"

1,4,"found that hilarious.
"
,,
1,4,"Why don't I go buy some groceries
"
,,
1,4,"and make us a nice romantic dinner?
"
,,
1,4,"Like when we were dating.
"
,,
1,4,"That oughta take your mind off the guys.
"
,,
1,4,"It already has.
"
,,
1,4,"I wonder what the guys are up to?
"

1,4,"That's nasty.
"

1,4,"Where's the damn pull string?
"
,,
1,4,"You never know what you're gonna
"

1,4,"find down here.
"

1,4,"Peter!
"
,,
1,4,"You're the Pawtucket Patriot.
"
,,
1,4,"Verily. Come hither and give heed.
"
,,
1,4,"Whoa. I don't swing that way, pal.
"
,,
1,4,"Look, I got a date with my female wife.
"
,,
1,4,"I just came down to get some beers.
"
,,
1,4,"Why spend time with your wife?
"
,,
1,4,"If you build a bar in this basement...
"

1,4,"...and stock it with plenty
"
,,
1,4,"of frosty Pawtucket Patriots...
"
,,
1,4,"...your friends will come down here
"
,,
1,4,"for a beer as well.
"
,,
1,4,"Build a bar! That's a great idea.
"
,,
1,4,"Wait. One last question.
"
,,
1,4,"If I walk through you,
"

1,4,"does that mean, like, we've done it?
"

1,4,"Jeez.
"

1,4,"What's with you and the gay jokes?
"

1,4,"Where the hell have you been?
"

1,4,"We had a date.
"

1,4,"Sorry, honey.
"
,,
1,4,"I must've lost track of the time.
"
,,
1,4,"What do you say?
"
,,
1,4,"You think the guys will like it?
"
,,
1,4,"This is why you missed our dinner?
"
,,
1,4,"To make a bar for your friends?
"
,,
1,4,"Yeah, isn't it great?
"
,,
1,4,"Oh, boy, I feel just like Tim Allen.
"
,,
1,4,"I build stuff and I have a criminal record.
"
,,
1,4,"Okay, guys. I got another one.
"
,,
1,4,"What's the difference
"

1,4,"between pornography and art?
"
,,
1,4,"Here it comes.
"
,,
1,4,"A government grant.
"
,,
1,4,"Peter, you are in the zone.
"
,,
1,4,"You know those little clam cakes
"
,,
1,4,"you make whenever...
"
,,
1,4,"...we have company? I need about a dozen.
"
,,
1,4,"Actually, better make it like 600.
"
,,
1,4,"That's it, Peter! I'm not a servant.
"
,,
1,4,"And I'm through taking care of you
"
,,
1,4,"and your bar buddies!
"
,,
1,4,"Jeez. Where the hell did that come from?
"
,,
1,4,"Watch the kids.
"

1,4,"that finger has erstwhile probed!
"

1,4,"There you go.
"
,,
1,4,"My mother used to use whiskey
"

"

1,4,"My tooth hurts!
"

1,4,"There. How's that feel?
"

1,4,"It's delightful.
"

1,4,"Lois, you are a wonderful woman.
"

1,4,"Words cannot express the depth

1,4,"of my appreciation and love for you.
"
,,
1,4,"Peter!
"
,,
1,4,"You must be Lois.
"
,,
1,4,"No, not silicone. Silicon.
"
,,
1,4,"And the design of the device...
"
,,
1,4,"...is quite ingenious
"
,,
1,4,"if I do say so myself, Misty.
"
,,
1,4,"What a delightful moniker.
"
,,
1,4,"You see, Misty...
"
,,
1,4,"...my time manipulator employs axioms...
"
,,
1,4,"...from the quantum theory
"
,,
1,4,"of molecular propulsion.

1,4,"Chris, what are you doing here?
"
,,
1,4,"Sorry, Mom.
"
,,
1,4,"I'm gonna need to see some ID.
"

1,4,"Chris, go to your room!
"
,,
1,4,"Hello, Mother. Care to partake in one...
"

1,4,"...of your oh-so-exhilarating games

1,4,"of peekaboo?
"
,,
1,4,"Oh, my God! My baby is drunk!
"

1,4,"No, I'm not!

1,4,"that we've been married...
"
,,
1,4,"...I have never been as angry as I...
"
,,
1,4,"What is my piano doing down here?
"
,,
1,4,"It was supposed to be a clam cake buffet,
"
,,
1,4,"but... Never mind.
"
,,
1,4,"That does it, Peter.
"
,,
1,4,"Either this bar goes or I do!
"
,,
1,4,"I haven't even told you
"
,,
1,4,"the other reason your piano's down here.
"
,,
1,4,"I wanted you to play it.
"
,,
1,4,"Like it was an instrument.
"
,,
1,4,"I'm telling you the truth. Right, guys?
"
,,
1,4,"Come on!
"
,,
1,4,"I couldn't.
"
,,
1,4,"Come on!
"
,,
1,4,"Maybe one song.
"

1,4,"Pretend you like it

1,4,"to prove that I love you

"
,,
1,4,"Sing it.
"
,,
1,4,"Something troubling you, Peter?
"
,,
1,4,"Nothing. Just all my friends
"
,,
1,4,"are eye-humping my wife.
"
,,
1,4,"""You'll never know if you don't know now""
"
,,
1,4,"Wonderful! Wow!
"
,,
1,4,"It was absolutely amazing.
"
,,
1,4,"The second that spotlight hit me,
"
,,
1,4,"I became a whole different person!
"
,,
1,4,"Silence, you contemptible shrew!
"
,,
1,4,"I bet your gums are still sore.
"
,,
1,4,"You're so observant, aren't you?
"

1,4,"Are you a detective?
"

1,4,"Yes, my gums are sore! Enough of this!
"

1,4,"I must complete my time machine,

1,4,"Hey, Dad.
"

1,4,"Mom says she was really on last night.
"

1,4,"Yeah. About that.
"
,,
1,4,"Lois, see, the guys were just being polite.
"
,,
1,4,"They thought your singing was too...
"
,,
1,4,"I was just nervous. Tonight'll be better.
"
,,
1,4,"Tonight? Honey, I don't think
"
,,
1,4,"anyone's gonna come back tonight.
"
,,
1,4,"""Gimme, gimme, gimme

1,4,"what I cry for

"
,,
1,4,"This one takes me back.
"
,,
1,4,"Now that's a woman!
"
,,
1,4,"That's a house. That's a fish. That's a bee!
"
,,
1,4,"""You know you made me love you""
"

1,4,"I love you.
"

1,4,"Thank you. Thank you.

1,4,"Johnny Muldoon, ladies and gentlemen.

1,4,"Let me finish the story, fellas.
"
,,
1,4,"You don't want to be up all night.
"
,,
1,4,"Or do you?
"
,,
1,4,"""Or do you?""
"
,,
1,4,"She's a smokin' little pistol, isn't she?
"
,,
1,4,"Are you a woman?
"
,,
1,4,"No.
"
,,
1,4,"My house arrest is over, Brian.
"
,,
1,4,"Round up the guys.
"
,,
1,4,"Now that I'm a free man,
"
,,
1,4,"we can do anything we want.
"
,,
1,4,"The guys only want to do one thing.
"
,,
1,4,"And that's ogle your wife.
"
,,
1,4,"If Lois were my woman,
"
,,
1,4,"I'd keep an eye on her.
"
,,
1,4,"Then again, I'm the jealous type.
"
,,
1,4,"Wow! Lois Griffin! I love your act.
"
,,
1,4,"Nice melons.
"
,,
1,4,"Listen, pal...
"
,,
1,4,"Peter, I'm holding melons.
"
,,
1,4,"And her hooters ain't bad either!
"
,,
1,4,"Now hang on a second there!
"
,,
1,4,"Peter, I'm holding hooters.
"
,,
1,4,"Sorry.
"
,,
1,4,"No problem.
"
,,
1,4,"Your wife's hot!
"
,,
1,4,"That's it!
"
,,
1,4,"Your singing days are over.
"
,,
1,4,"If I wanted to marry Lola Falana,
"
,,
1,4,"I would have.
"
,,
1,4,"Look, Lola. This whole thing
"
,,
1,4,"is just going way too fast for me.
"
,,
1,4,"For the last time, I'm not Lola!
"
,,
1,4,"I'm Leslie Uggams!
"
,,
1,4,"Peter, having me sing was your idea
"
,,
1,4,"in the first place.
"
,,
1,4,"I just wanted to keep my bar.
"
,,
1,4,"I built that thing so my friends...
"
,,
1,4,"...would come to see me, not you.
"
,,
1,4,"Is that so? Let me tell you something.
"
,,
1,4,"I love singing! And I will continue to sing!
"
,,
1,4,"How dare you upset me
"
,,
1,4,"this close to showtime!
"
,,
1,4,"Lois.
"
,,
1,4,"Watch where you're going, buddy.
"
,,
1,4,"Griffin, I got a bone to pick with you.
"
,,
1,4,"Listen, I don't want any more trouble.
"
,,
1,4,"Thanks to your wife...
"
,,
1,4,"...my husband hasn't been home all week!
"
,,
1,4,"That singing hussy is destroying
"
,,
1,4,"our marriages!
"
,,
1,4,"Yeah, then do something about it.
"
,,
1,4,"Come to my basement tonight and
"
,,
1,4,"drag your husbands out of there.
"
,,
1,4,"Maybe we will.
"
,,
1,4,"Yeah!
"
,,
1,4,"Jeez, fella. Can't you take that outside?
"
,,
1,4,"This next number is dedicated

"
,,
1,4,"Oh, boy. Lois is pretty pissed, huh?
"
,,
1,4,"Yes, your judgment lately
"
,,
1,4,"has been rather...
"
,,
1,4,"You have crappy judgment anyway.
"
,,
1,4,"This is intolerable!
"
,,
1,4,"This foolishness is preventing me
"
,,
1,4,"from completing work on...
"
,,
1,4,"Egads! The blueprints
"
,,
1,4,"for my time machine!
"
,,
1,4,"Those are for my eyes only!
"
,,
1,4,"Thank you.
"
,,
1,4,"Look everyone,
"
,,
1,4,"Stewie drew a picture for his mommy.
"
,,
1,4,"No!
"
,,
1,4,"Hold up the picture. Let's see.
"
,,
1,4,"No! Nothing to see here.
"
,,
1,4,"How cute. It's a time machine!
"
,,
1,4,"No! It's a...
"
,,
1,4,"Blast, what the devil do children draw?
"
,,
1,4,"It's a pheasant!
"
,,
1,4,"A time machine. Sure.
"
,,
1,4,"Here's where the flux capacitor goes.
"
,,
1,4,"I can't wait to build
"
,,
1,4,"one of these of my own.
"
,,
1,4,"I'll not stand idly by
"
,,
1,4,"while you abrogate my plans.
"
,,
1,4,"You shall rue this day. Go on! Start ruing!
"
,,
1,4,"Bye-bye, Stewie. Mommy will be upstairs
"
,,
1,4,"to kiss you good night.
"
,,
1,4,"Burn in hell!
"
,,
1,4,"Hell. Hell has fire.
"
,,
1,4,"And you know what else?
"
,,
1,4,"""It's got steam heat
"
,,
1,4,"""I got steam heat
"
,,
1,4,"""But I need your love to keep away the cold
"
,,
1,4,"I got...""
"
,,
1,4,"All right, break it up!
"
,,
1,4,"What's going on here?
"
,,
1,4,"Your little peep show is over!
"
,,
1,4,"We're taking back our men!
"
,,
1,4,"Peep show? I just do this for fun.
"
,,
1,4,"Look, all day long I scrub and cook...
"
,,
1,4,"...and take care of my kids.
"
,,
1,4,"And nobody cheers.
"
,,
1,4,"No one even says thank you.
"
,,
1,4,"But when the band starts playing and...
"
,,
1,4,"...the music's flowing through me,
"
,,
1,4,"I feel, I don't know, special.
"
,,
1,4,"I guess you all think that's pretty silly.
"
,,
1,4,"Not at all.
"
,,
1,4,"You didn't tell us that part!
"
,,
1,4,"Peter, you're behind all this?
"
,,
1,4,"Yes. And you'll never catch me!
"
,,
1,4,"I bet he also didn't tell you he never
"
,,
1,4,"helps me around the house.
"
,,
1,4,"Or takes me out to dinner.
"
,,
1,4,"Or notices when I get my hair done.
"
,,
1,4," Oh, no, that's just...
"
,,
1,4," My husband's the same way.
"
,,
1,4,"So's mine.
"
,,
1,4,"Wow, this place is full of dead pigeons.
"
,,
1,4,"I'm gonna go grab some ozone.
"
,,
1,4,"Peter! There's a king in the cards!
"
,,
1,4,"They saw my blueprints!
"
,,
1,4,"What a grievous breach of security!
"
,,
1,4,"Damn! What do to? Wait for it... Yes!
"
,,
1,4,"Instead of moving time forward
"
,,
1,4,"to bypass this wretched teething...
"
,,
1,4,"...it might just be possible to reverse
"
,,
1,4,"time's heady flow...
"
,,
1,4,"...and undo ever having drawn
"
,,
1,4,"those damnable blueprints.
"
,,
1,4," You'll never get away with this!
"
,,
1,4," Silence!
"
,,
1,4,"Lois, you make it sound
"
,,
1,4,"like I don't appreciate you at all.
"
,,
1,4,"Peter, when was the last time
"
,,
1,4,"you told me you love me?
"
,,
1,4,"You know I do.
"
,,
1,4,"I want to hear it!
"
,,
1,4,"Is that what this is all about?
"
,,
1,4,"Run for your lives!
"

1,4,"Holy crap!
"

1,4,"Hot!
"
,,
1,4,"There's no way out!
"
,,
1,4,"At last! My time device is complete!
"
,,
1,4,"Just one final adjustment. There.
"
,,
1,4,"Now I shall negate ever having drawn
"
,,
1,4,"those damnable blueprints.
"
,,
1,4,"Blast!
"
,,
1,4,"Jeez. We're screwed!
"
,,
1,4,"Look, I promise if we get out of this alive...
"
,,
1,4,"...l'm gonna help out around the house
"
,,
1,4,"and say ""I love you"" every day.
"
,,
1,4,"You mean it?
"
,,
1,4,"I'm a changed man, Lois. A better man.
"
,,
1,4,"And to think,
"
,,
1,4,"if I hadn't taken Chris to his soccer game...
"
,,
1,4,"...I never would've learned
"
,,
1,4,"this valuable lesson.

,,
1,5,"with our secret weapon...
"
,,
1,5,"...Guillermo.
"
,,
1,5,"Bravo!
"
,,
1,5,"I hired Guillermo because I believe
"
,,
1,5,"he'll be an asset to our company...
"
,,
1,5,"...on and off the field.
"
,,
1,5,"You have impeccable credentials.
"
,,
1,5,"I'm sure I can find a position
"
,,
1,5,"for you somewhere.
"
,,
1,5,"Back to work, people.
"
,,
1,5,"Mr. Weed, I got a great idea for
"
,,
1,5,"a new line of TV action figures.
"
,,
1,5,"Facts of Life Transformers, huh?
"
,,
1,5,"Watch the transformation.
"
,,
1,5,"Cute as a button...
"
,,
1,5,"...fat as a cow...
"
,,
1,5,"...radioactive scorpion.
"
,,
1,5,"Watch out, Mrs. Garrett. Here comes Blair.
"
,,
1,5," I'll consider it.
"
,,
1,5," He'll consider it!
"
,,
1,5,"I got another one where Natalie's one of
"
,,
1,5,"those spittin' lizards from Jurassic Park.
"
,,
1,5,"Pat, I would like to solve the puzzle.
"
,,
1,5,"""Go tuck yourself in. ""
"
,,
1,5,"You got it.
"
,,
1,5,"Well, you were close, Dad.
"
,,
1,5,"Yeah. I still can't believe we missed
"
,,
1,5,"the phrase, ""My hairy aunt. ""
"
,,
1,5,"Come on, Brian.
"
,,
1,5,"I gotta get to softball practice.
"
,,
1,5,"Practice? I thought we'd go next door
"
,,
1,5,"and welcome our new neighbors.
"
,,
1,5,"No. I don't want anything to do
"
,,
1,5,"with neighbors.
"
,,
1,5,"Last guy who lived next door
"
,,
1,5,"borrowed my toaster. Never saw it again.
"
,,
1,5,"If that slut wants full custody of the kids,
"
,,
1,5,"she's got it.
"
,,
1,5,"Peter, they might be very nice people.
"
,,
1,5,"""Very nice people. ""
"
,,
1,5,"Yeah, that's what they always say.
"
,,
1,5,"Then you open up the septic tank and...
"
,,
1,5,"Skeleton city!
"
,,
1,5,"Pervert!
"
,,
1,5,"Don't flatter yourself, honey.
"
,,
1,5,"I don't have any sweat glands.
"
,,
1,5,"Okay, time for batting practice,
"
,,
1,5,"my Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Boys.
"
,,
1,5,"Guillermo, you're up.
"
,,
1,5,"Unfortunately Johnson isn't here
"
,,
1,5,"to pitch today. His wife is in labor.
"
,,
1,5,"Oh, what? Is the baby coming out of him?
"
,,
1,5,"Jeez, I'll pitch.
"
,,
1,5,"I don't know what's more questionable,
"
,,
1,5,"your pitching arm or Bill Clinton's integrity.
"
,,
1,5,"Oh, how hard...
"
,,
1,5,"Oh, how hard can it be to pitch?
"
,,
1,5," Okay. Take your base.
"
,,
1,5," Somebody call 911.
"
,,
1,5,"Tell them he is allergic to penicillin
"
,,
1,5,"and white zinfandel!
"
,,
1,5,"Idiot! If you don't find a ringer
"
,,
1,5,"to replace Guillermo, you're fired!
"
,,
1,5,"Man. What'll I do if I get fired?
"
,,
1,5,"I'll have to go back to my old job...
"
,,
1,5,"...as a Calvin Klein model.
"
,,
1,5,"I don't wanna be like everyone else.
"
,,
1,5,"But I don't want to be different.
"
,,
1,5,"I just want to be.
"
,,
1,5,"What was the name
"
,,
1,5,"of the bad guy from Tron?
"
,,
1,5,"This is gonna drive me nuts!
"
,,
1,5,"Moving is never easy on a family.
"
,,
1,5,"Well, we are gonna miss
"
,,
1,5,"the go-go-go pace of Providence.
"
,,
1,5,"But with number two on the way,
"
,,
1,5,"Joe thought it was time to move.
"
,,
1,5,"And I can't say no to Joe. Ever.
"
,,
1,5,"Quahog can be pretty exciting, too.
"
,,
1,5,"Last week, someone lost an eye at Bingo.
"
,,
1,5,"L-17. Darn it.
"
,,
1,5,"I haven't played Bingo in years!
"
,,
1,5,"Silence! Ever since you two met,
"
,,
1,5,"you've done nothing but wax idiotic!
"
,,
1,5,"I must escape this infernal babble!
"
,,
1,5,"What a little explorer.
"
,,
1,5,"Yes. He's so full of wonder.
"
,,
1,5,"To be the Lindbergh baby right about now.
"
,,
1,5,"Joe, you have to meet
"
,,
1,5,"our new neighbor, Lois Griffin.
"
,,
1,5,"It's a pleasure, Lois. Who's the little guy?
"
,,
1,5,"This is Stewie.
"
,,
1,5,"Honey, say hi to Mr. Swanson.
"
,,
1,5,"You will bow to me.
"
,,
1,5,"Hi. I'm Meg. I live next door.
"
,,
1,5,"I know.
"
,,
1,5,"I've admired you in the garden from afar.
"
,,
1,5," Will you go out with me?
"
,,
1,5," I'd love to.
"
,,
1,5,"Oh, he's gay.
"
,,
1,5,"You wish!
"
,,
1,5,"Get out of here, you mouth breather!
"
,,
1,5,"I'm as good as fired.
"
,,
1,5,"Where the hell am I gonna find a guy
"
,,
1,5,"as strong as Guillermo?
"
,,
1,5,"One time I walked into the locker room,
"
,,
1,5,"I swear he was bench-pressing Mr. Weed.
"
,,
1,5,"Great. Lois is getting chummy
"
,,
1,5,"with the new neighbors.
"
,,
1,5,"She wants you to meet them.
"
,,
1,5,"She's always making me be social.
"
,,
1,5,"Cocktail parties, school functions,
"
,,
1,5,"that time we planted trees in Jerusalem.
"
,,
1,5,"What? Look, all I'm saying is
"
,,
1,5,"put an Israeli guy next to an Arab guy...
"
,,
1,5,"...and I can't tell the difference.
"
,,
1,5," You must be Peter. Joe Swanson.
"
,,
1,5," Yeah, yeah. Nice to meet you, Phil.
"
,,
1,5,"You got a neighbor
"
,,
1,5,"on the other side of your house, too.
"
,,
1,5,"So, don't think you always have to bug me.
"
,,
1,5,"I'll keep that in mind. Say, do you have
"
,,
1,5,"a screwdriver I can borrow?
"
,,
1,5,"Man, you neighbors are like viruses.
"
,,
1,5,"Starts with a screwdriver.
"
,,
1,5,"Before you know it,
"
,,
1,5,"you're using my supermarket...
"
,,
1,5,"...my dry cleaner, and even my postman.
"
,,
1,5,"Can you believe that guy?
"
,,
1,5,"""Do you have a screwdriver I can borrow?""
"
,,
1,5,"What an ass.
"
,,
1,5," Did you find a replacement for the team?
"
,,
1,5," No. Believe me, I've been looking.
"
,,
1,5,"Hideo-san would be honored to play
"
,,
1,5,"for your team.
"
,,
1,5,"But he wishes to know
"
,,
1,5,"what compensation you offer.
"
,,
1,5,"Me love you long time.
"
,,
1,5,"Gosh, I'd like to help.
"
,,
1,5,"But I've gotta go out in the hall...
"
,,
1,5,"...and chew on my ass for five minutes.
"
,,
1,5,"Peter, I invited Joe and Bonnie
"
,,
1,5,"to your game on Saturday.
"
,,
1,5,"Lois, I don't want those people there.
"
,,
1,5,"See, this is why I ask you
"
,,
1,5,"to submit everything to me in writing first.
"
,,
1,5,"Bonnie told me Joe is a big baseball fan.
"
,,
1,5,"He played in college.
"
,,
1,5,"He did?
"
,,
1,5,"Welcome to the neighborhood.
"
,,
1,5,"Hiya, Joe.
"
,,
1,5," Peter!
"
,,
1,5," Don't get up.
"
,,
1,5,"This is a surprise.
"
,,
1,5,"I kinda thought you didn't like me.
"
,,
1,5,"What? Because of what I said
"
,,
1,5,"this afternoon. No.
"
,,
1,5,"See I have that disease
"
,,
1,5,"where stuff pops out of your mouth.
"
,,
1,5,"Go to hell! Whoops. See what I mean?
"
,,
1,5,"I'm so sorry.
"
,,
1,5,"I thought maybe I crossed the line
"
,,
1,5,"when I asked to borrow a screwdriver.
"
,,
1,5,"Are you kidding?
"
,,
1,5,"You can borrow whatever you want.
"
,,
1,5,"Great. Say, you don't happen
"
,,
1,5,"to have any picture wire, do you?
"
,,
1,5,"Picture wire? You son of a bitch.
"
,,
1,5,"Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!
"
,,
1,5,"There it goes again.
"
,,
1,5,"I don't want to impose.
"
,,
1,5,"No problem. That's what neighbors do.
"
,,
1,5,"You know what else they do?
"
,,
1,5,"They play on their neighbor's company
"
,,
1,5,"softball team like this Saturday.
"
,,
1,5,"What do you say, neighbor?
"
,,
1,5,"Sounds fun.
"
,,
1,5,"So much fun it should be illegal
"
,,
1,5,"like copyright infringement.
"
,,
1,5,"See you at the game, Joe.
"
,,
1,5," Hey, you want a piece of gum?
"
,,
1,5," Thanks.
"
,,
1,5," That was joke gum.
"
,,
1,5," What do you mean?
"
,,
1,5,"Now you're addicted to heroin.
"
,,
1,5,"I'm cold.
"
,,
1,5,"Hey, Peter!
"
,,
1,5,"It's nice that your family is here.
"
,,
1,5,"If your ringer doesn't arrive soon,
"
,,
1,5,"you can spend every day with them...
"
,,
1,5,"...at home.
"
,,
1,5,"He'll be here, Mr. Weed.
"
,,
1,5,"You should see this guy in action.
"
,,
1,5,"He can hit, he can throw...
"
,,
1,5,"Peter!
"
,,
1,5,"What's he doing in a wheelchair?
"
,,
1,5,"Holy crip, he's a crapple!
"
,,
1,5,"Peter, our new secret weapon
"
,,
1,5,"is this very attractive paraplegic?
"
,,
1,5,"Okay, Joe, you got me.
"
,,
1,5,"Rise and shine. Come on.
"
,,
1,5," Stand and deliver. Get the hell up.
"
,,
1,5," You're a hoot, Peter.
"
,,
1,5," Play ball!
"
,,
1,5," Let's do it!
"
,,
1,5,"I swear I didn't know.
"
,,
1,5,"Maybe they won't hit a lot of balls to him.
"
,,
1,5,"I got shortstop.
"
,,
1,5,"The movers tracked grease
"
,,
1,5,"all over my carpet.
"
,,
1,5," I tried everything to get the stain out.
"
,,
1,5," What about lemon juice?
"
,,
1,5," What about club soda?
"
,,
1,5," What about shutting the hell up?
"
,,
1,5,"Isn't baseball great?
"
,,
1,5,"They say baseball's the national pastime.
"
,,
1,5,"I can't taste salt.
"
,,
1,5,"Crap! Don't hit it to Joe.
"
,,
1,5,"Please don't hit it to Joe!
"
,,
1,5,"You're out!
"
,,
1,5,"All right, Joe!
"
,,
1,5,"Way to earn that parking space!
"
,,
1,5,"All right!
"
,,
1,5,"Did you see that?
"
,,
1,5,"That's my Joe!
"
,,
1,5,"What the deuce?
"
,,
1,5,"Half man, half machine.
"
,,
1,5,"Why with that technology,
"
,,
1,5,"I could escape these wretched harridans!
"
,,
1,5,"Go, cyborg!
"
,,
1,5,"It all rests on that man's broad,
"
,,
1,5,"rippling shoulders!
"
,,
1,5,"All right, Joe! Run!
"
,,
1,5,"All right, Joe! Come on! Yeah!
"
,,
1,5,"Hurry! Joe!
"
,,
1,5,"All right! Yes, vamos!
"
,,
1,5,"Let's hear it for Joe!
"
,,
1,5,"Yeah, let's hear it for the guy
"
,,
1,5,"who found Joe!
"
,,
1,5,"Okay.
"
,,
1,5,"That's finger suckin' good, huh?
"
,,
1,5,"It's an old policemen's recipe.
"
,,
1,5,"Eat up, everyone. Tonight my wife won't
"
,,
1,5,"be the only one enjoying a pig in a blanket.
"
,,
1,5,"Joe, you're so funny.
"
,,
1,5,"They love that one down at the Precinct.
"
,,
1,5,"This sucks, Brian.
"
,,
1,5,"Joe is stealing my thunder.
"
,,
1,5,"Hey, everybody! Time to limbo!
"
,,
1,5," Face it. He's the life of the party.
"
,,
1,5," Yeah?
"
,,
1,5,"I'll show you who's the life of the party.
"
,,
1,5,"Hey, look!
"
,,
1,5,"I fell in the pool with my clothes on!
"
,,
1,5,"How hilarious is that?
"
,,
1,5,"That is so Peter Griffin. Guys?
"
,,
1,5,"Guys?
"
,,
1,5,"That's my idea.
"
,,
1,5,"Peter, come here.
"
,,
1,5,"Finally. A little recognition.
"
,,
1,5,"Joe has the most wonderful idea.
"
,,
1,5,"Hey, I just suggested a line
"
,,
1,5,"of handi-capable toys, you know...
"
,,
1,5,"...to show kids the fun side
"
,,
1,5,"of being physically challenged!
"
,,
1,5,"That's what kids want to play with.
"
,,
1,5,"Yeah. A Beanie Baby in a bubble.
"
,,
1,5,"What about my idea? Come on!
"
,,
1,5,"Tootie morphs into a stink bug.
"
,,
1,5,"Joe, you're exactly the kind of man
"
,,
1,5,"we need at our company.
"
,,
1,5,"Peter, make yourself useful.
"
,,
1,5,"Go get Joe a drink.
"
,,
1,5,"Jeez, first he takes my friends.
"
,,
1,5,"Then he takes my job.
"
,,
1,5,"But the way I wear my hat...
"
,,
1,5,"No, no. He can't take that away from me.
"
,,
1,5,"You! How came you
"
,,
1,5,"by this metal construct?
"
,,
1,5," I demand to know who made you!
"
,,
1,5," Stewie, it's not polite to point.
"
,,
1,5,"I'm so sorry.
"
,,
1,5,"That's okay, Lois.
"
,,
1,5,"He's just curious about the chair.
"
,,
1,5,"About 10 years ago I was investigating
"
,,
1,5,"a robbery at an orphanage.
"
,,
1,5,"It was Christmas Eve
"
,,
1,5,"and some presents had been stolen.
"
,,
1,5,"Reach for the sky, dirtbag!
"
,,
1,5,"All right, pal!
"
,,
1,5,"You've stolen your last Christmas.
"
,,
1,5,"""You think you have won
"
,,
1,5,"You think all is well
"
,,
1,5,"""But kiss my green ass
"
,,
1,5,"I shall see you in hell!""
"
,,
1,5,"Are you Timmy?
"
,,
1,5,"Merry Christmas, Timmy.
"
,,
1,5,"Enough!
"
,,
1,5,"If you won't share your technological
"
,,
1,5,"schemata with me peaceably...
"
,,
1,5,"...I shall take the information
"
,,
1,5,"from you by force!
"
,,
1,5,"Wow. Looks like you have a fan.
"
,,
1,5," Come on. Let's get out of here.
"
,,
1,5," Peter, you can't leave.
"
,,
1,5,"Sorry, I promised the wife and kids I'd...
"
,,
1,5,"...take them on a dream vacation
"
,,
1,5,"to Hawaii right now. Say aloha, kids.
"
,,
1,5,"What are you talking about? We want to
"
,,
1,5,"hear more of Mr. Swanson's stories.
"
,,
1,5,"He's cool, Dad. He killed a guy.
"
,,
1,5,"Well, technically he was killed by the state,
"
,,
1,5,"but funny story.
"
,,
1,5,"He did curse my name
"
,,
1,5,"just before the injection.
"
,,
1,5,"Peter, what's the matter with you?
"
,,
1,5,"Why are you guys making such a big deal
"
,,
1,5,"over Joe?
"
,,
1,5,"You don't admire wheelchair people.
"
,,
1,5,"You're supposed to feel sorry for them.
"
,,
1,5,"When did it become okay
"
,,
1,5,"to be handicapped?
"
,,
1,5,"Don't talk like that!
"
,,
1,5,"He's a remarkable man
"
,,
1,5,"and the rest of your family adores him!
"
,,
1,5,"Fine. Then why don't you all marry him?
"
,,
1,5,"And if he's so remarkable,
"
,,
1,5,"let's see him do this.
"
,,
1,5,"Hey, look at me. I'm walking.
"
,,
1,5,"I'm a remarkable man.
"
,,
1,5,"Well, look who finally came home.
"
,,
1,5,"I thought you were gonna spend
"
,,
1,5,"all night at Joe's.
"
,,
1,5,"I could've. That man has got magic fingers.
"
,,
1,5,"He found this one spot behind my ear, I...
"
,,
1,5,"Forget about it.
"
,,
1,5,"I thought my leg was never gonna stop.
"
,,
1,5,"I don't believe this.
"
,,
1,5,"My whole family worships the ground
"
,,
1,5,"that guy can't walk on.
"
,,
1,5,"It's not too hard to see why. He's a hero.
"
,,
1,5,"He makes the world a better place.
"
,,
1,5,"I've done lots of things to help people.
"
,,
1,5,"Remember the time I sang to the kids
"
,,
1,5,"at the Sunday school?
"
,,
1,5,"Yes, you forgot the words.
"
,,
1,5,"""Jesus loves me
"
,,
1,5,"""He loves me a bunch
"
,,
1,5,"""Because He always puts Skippy
"
,,
1,5,"""In my lunch""
"
,,
1,5,"No. It's not the same thing.
"
,,
1,5,"Joe puts himself in real danger every day.
"
,,
1,5,"You're right. I'll never be that kind of hero.
"
,,
1,5,"Unless I put myself in real danger, too!
"
,,
1,5,"For my family's sake!
"
,,
1,5,"Why are the pretty ones
"
,,
1,5,"always so dumb?
"
,,
1,5,"Gang shooting on
"
,,
1,5,"Third and Main. Three wounded, one dead.
"
,,
1,5," Is it me or is rap music just getting lazier?
"
,,
1,5," No. It's my new police scanner.
"
,,
1,5,"This hero thing is gonna be easy
"
,,
1,5,"once I find the right crime.
"
,,
1,5,"Domestic disturbance...
"
,,
1,5,"Boring!
"
,,
1,5,"Report of a stabbing in...
"
,,
1,5,"All units! A major robbery
"
,,
1,5,"is in progress at Quahog Bank and Trust.
"
,,
1,5,"Suspects are armed
"
,,
1,5,"and extremely dangerous.
"
,,
1,5," Perfect! Where's Lois and the kids?
"
,,
1,5," Over at Joe's.
"
,,
1,5,"Well, go fetch 'em.
"
,,
1,5,"They're about to see a real hero in action.
"
,,
1,5,"To the Batcave!
"
,,
1,5,"Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
"
,,
1,5,"You thought Joe was something.
"
,,
1,5,"You ain't seen nothin' yet.
"
,,
1,5,"Peter, what's the big rush?
"
,,
1,5,"All right, you guys wait right here.
"
,,
1,5,"Daddy's gonna make a little withdrawal.
"
,,
1,5,"Give Tammy a round of applause.
"
,,
1,5,"This was her first robbery
"
,,
1,5,"and she was very brave.
"
,,
1,5,"Now before we go...
"
,,
1,5,"No, don't go.
"
,,
1,5,"Oh, princess, we have to.
"
,,
1,5,"I hope you brought
"
,,
1,5,"your striped pajamas, boys.
"
,,
1,5,"Because there's a five-year sleepover
"
,,
1,5,"at the big house. And you're invited.
"
,,
1,5,"You'll never take us alive!
"
,,
1,5,"Lois and the kids
"
,,
1,5,"should be in here to see this.
"
,,
1,5,"Yes. It's going very well.
"
,,
1,5,"Mom, what do you do when you like a boy
"
,,
1,5,"but he doesn't even notice you?
"
,,
1,5,"Meg loves Kevin.
"
,,
1,5,"Shut up, you big sack of dog vomit!
"
,,
1,5,"Meg, you're a sweet, lovely girl.
"
,,
1,5,"He'll come around.
"
,,
1,5,"Such a mom answer.
"
,,
1,5,"Have you tried showing off the goods?
"
,,
1,5,"How's that for a mom answer?
"
,,
1,5,"Creepy.
"
,,
1,5,"I saw some cute dresses down the street.
"
,,
1,5,"If nothing else, it'll make you feel better.
"
,,
1,5,"Come on, you guys.
"
,,
1,5,"If you want to be a hero,
"
,,
1,5,"now might be a good time.
"
,,
1,5,"This isn't what I was expecting.
"
,,
1,5,"I thought being a hero
"
,,
1,5,"would be all fun and games.
"
,,
1,5,"Sorry, Wonder Woman.
"
,,
1,5,"I got three kings. Now let's see your pair.
"
,,
1,5,"All right. Robin, what are you looking
"
,,
1,5,"at me for? Look at her.
"
,,
1,5,"Come on. Let's go.
"
,,
1,5,"Oh, perfect.
"
,,
1,5,"We got hostages!
"
,,
1,5,"Don't try anything funny!
"
,,
1,5,"Don't worry, Brian. I got a plan.
"
,,
1,5,"Good. I was afraid
"
,,
1,5,"you were just gonna improvise.
"
,,
1,5,"Actually, I was gonna use
"
,,
1,5,"the little girl as a human shield...
"
,,
1,5,"...and run like hell.
"
,,
1,5,"But improvise, that'll be easier on my back.
"
,,
1,5,"Okay, in this improv, Tammy and
"
,,
1,5,"the short robber are husband and wife.
"
,,
1,5,"Okay. And where are we?
"
,,
1,5,"A bar!
"
,,
1,5,"A pet store!
"
,,
1,5,"Guadalajara, Mexico!
"
,,
1,5,"Okay, okay. I heard pet store.
"
,,
1,5,"And I'm the gruff but lovable owner.
"
,,
1,5,"All right. Begin. Hello, married couple.
"
,,
1,5,"I see you found a puppy.
"
,,
1,5,"Yeah. His name is Sparky.
"
,,
1,5,"Well, before you take Sparky home,
"
,,
1,5,"let me check him for worms.
"
,,
1,5,"Okay, drop it!
"
,,
1,5,"All right, you guys. Let's get out of here.
"
,,
1,5,"All right, stand back!
"
,,
1,5,"Whoa. Hang on. Sorry, no one can leave.
"
,,
1,5,"Listen, the whole reason I saved
"
,,
1,5,"you guys today was so I could be a hero.
"
,,
1,5,"This wheelchair guy moved in next door
"
,,
1,5,"and he can do all these great things and...
"
,,
1,5,"Your family idolizes the lousy cripple
"
,,
1,5,"and not you?
"
,,
1,5,"That's right! How'd you know?
"
,,
1,5,"We've all been there.
"
,,
1,5,"Cool! The bank is getting jacked!
"
,,
1,5,"Officer, my husband's in there!
"
,,
1,5," Can you tell me if he's okay?
"
,,
1,5," What's he look like?
"
,,
1,5,"He's wearing a white-collared shirt,
"
,,
1,5,"kind of big, with glasses.
"
,,
1,5,"I got him.
"
,,
1,5,"Oh, thank God.
"
,,
1,5," Take him out.
"
,,
1,5," No!
"
,,
1,5,"Hey, there's my family.
"
,,
1,5,"I just want you to know I rob banks...
"
,,
1,5,"...because a deaf man stole my job
"
,,
1,5,"at the phone company.
"
,,
1,5,"So if anyone's gonna bust me,
"
,,
1,5,"I'm glad it's you.
"
,,
1,5,"But... But I was gonna be a hero.
"
,,
1,5,"Nobody's going anywhere!
"
,,
1,5,"Joe, it's Peter! He's in trouble!
"
,,
1,5,"A failed robbery at
"
,,
1,5,"Quahog Bank and Trust...
"
,,
1,5,"...has led to a terrifying hostage situation.
"
,,
1,5,"That's right. A hostage situation.
"
,,
1,5," I gotta go.
"
,,
1,5," I know.
"
,,
1,5,"If we want the cops to take us seriously,
"
,,
1,5,"we have to waste a hostage. But who?
"
,,
1,5," Excuse me. Shouldn't that be ""whom""?
"
,,
1,5," Okay, you.
"
,,
1,5,"Crap!
"
,,
1,5,"This is Police Lieutenant
"
,,
1,5,"Joe Swanson. I know we can work this out.
"
,,
1,5,"Not him again. I hope this place
"
,,
1,5,"isn't wheelchair accessible.
"
,,
1,5,"Bonnie, it's Peter.
"
,,
1,5,"Don't worry.
"
,,
1,5,"Joe's an excellent negotiator.
"
,,
1,5,"I was a virgin when we met.
"
,,
1,5,"It took him three hours.
"
,,
1,5,"I can't believe my dad is in there.
"
,,
1,5,"This'll probably scar me
"
,,
1,5,"for the rest of my life.
"
,,
1,5,"I got a new dress.
"
,,
1,5,"Try talking about him.
"
,,
1,5,"So do you like music?
"
,,
1,5,"Yeah! I played guitar
"
,,
1,5,"in a band before we moved.
"
,,
1,5,"But it interfered with my studies.
"
,,
1,5,"What do you listen to?
"
,,
1,5,"You first.
"
,,
1,5,"I'm into Garbage, Phish, Blur.
"
,,
1,5,"My parents don't like me
"
,,
1,5,"listening to that stuff.
"
,,
1,5,"But I do anyway because I am not a robot!
"
,,
1,5,"I also like Radiohead.
"
,,
1,5,"And even though society has turned
"
,,
1,5,"its back on you...
"
,,
1,5,"...I promise you there are people who care.
"
,,
1,5,"And you know what? I'm one of them.
"
,,
1,5,"He sure gets it.
"
,,
1,5,"Maybe he's right.
"
,,
1,5,"We can make a new start.
"
,,
1,5,"Come on, guys.
"
,,
1,5,"Don't let him sweet talk you like that.
"
,,
1,5,"Wait. You can't leave now.
"
,,
1,5,"I'm supposed to be the hero. Wait!
"
,,
1,5,"Can you let me pistol-whip you
"
,,
1,5,"a couple times for the camera?
"
,,
1,5,"Stupid robbers with your guns
"
,,
1,5,"and your make-out parties.
"
,,
1,5,"Excellent!
"
,,
1,5,"They detached the human component
"
,,
1,5,"from the machine.
"
,,
1,5,"Machine, I am your new master
"
,,
1,5,"and I order you to go!
"
,,
1,5,"Engage!
"
,,
1,5,"Blast! Must be some kind of
"
,,
1,5,"proprietary command system.
"
,,
1,5,"Now on the Russian MiG,
"
,,
1,5,"it's next to the altimeter.
"
,,
1,5,"There you are.
"
,,
1,5,"I can't turn my back on you for a second.
"
,,
1,5,"One day I shall unlock the secret
"
,,
1,5,"of that device.
"
,,
1,5,"And when I do, Mother, victory shall be...
"
,,
1,5,"Peter, you had us so worried.
"
,,
1,5,"What on earth were you trying to prove?
"
,,
1,5,"I'm sorry. Joe is a great guy.
"
,,
1,5,"I guess I was just tired of him
"
,,
1,5,"being your hero.
"
,,
1,5,"Peter, Joe is a hero. But he's not our hero.
"
,,
1,5," You are.
"
,,
1,5," Really?
"
,,
1,5,"Yeah.
"
,,
1,5,"You're always right there on the couch
"
,,
1,5,"for us, making us laugh when we're upset.
"
,,
1,5,"Changing the channel
"
,,
1,5,"when something boring comes on.
"
,,
1,5,"Eating the last slice of pizza
"
,,
1,5,"so the rest of us don't fight over it.
"
,,
1,5,"Yeah, Daddy.
"
,,
1,5,"If you hadn't pulled this stunt...
"
,,
1,5,"...I wouldn't know
"
,,
1,5,"how to manipulate Kevin.
"
,,
1,5,"And when the kids at school see us on TV...
"
,,
1,5,"...they'll think you're a total psycho.
"
,,
1,5,"And I can say, ""That psycho is my dad!""
"
,,
1,5,"I wouldn't have won silver in Nagano,
"
,,
1,5,"had you not driven me...
"
,,
1,5,"...to the ice rink every morning at 6:00 a. m.
"
,,
1,5,"I guess being a hero isn't always
"
,,
1,5,"about saving lives and catching bad guys.
"
,,
1,5,"It's also about just being there
"
,,
1,5,"for the people you love.
"
,,
1,5,"Help!
"
,,
1,5,"Someone just stole my purse!
"
,,
1,5,"Who cares? I don't even know you.
"
,,
1,6,"Blasted matriarch!
"
,,
1,6,"She has failed once again to replenish
"
,,
1,6,"this frigid box with potations.
"
,,
1,6,"l shall give her a piece of my mind!
"
,,
1,6,"Damn it!
"
,,
1,6,"Now look here, you.... Oh, my God!
"
,,
1,6,"Now you shouldn't be frightened, Stewie.
"
,,
1,6,"What you saw was actually
"
,,
1,6,"a very beautiful thing.
"
,,
1,6,"Evidently, madam, you and l differ greatly
"
,,
1,6,"in our conception of beauty.
"
,,
1,6,"What l just witnessed
"
,,
1,6,"was ghastlier than a thousand ghouls!
"
,,
1,6,"Stewie, mommies and daddies
"
,,
1,6,"like to hug each other that way.
"
,,
1,6,"ln fact, sweetie,
"
,,
1,6,"that's sort of how you were created.
"
,,
1,6,"That is a vile and odious lie!
"
,,
1,6,"How dare you fill my head
"
,,
1,6,"with such loathsome propaganda?
"
,,
1,6,"Get out, you horrid woman!
"
,,
1,6,"Okay, honey. l'll go get your teddy bear.
"
,,
1,6,"Good Lord.
"
,,
1,6,"You saw them together, didn't you?
"
,,
1,6,"You know the tub
"
,,
1,6,"where you take your little baths?
"
,,
1,6,"They've done it there, too.
"
,,
1,6,"LOlS:
"
,,
1,6,"''lt seems today that all you see
"
,,

1,6,"Ladies, this Saturday at 0800
"

1,6,"there will be a soapbox derby...
"

1,6,"...as a reward for all your obedience.
"
,,
1,6,"Mom, Dad, I reaIIy Iike Potsie.
"
,,
1,6,"Why not, dear? Potsie's a very nice boy.
"
,,
1,6,"No, Mom. I mean, I reaIIy Iike Potsie.
"
,,
1,6,"MR. CUNNlNGHAM:
"
,,
1,6,"We heard you the first time.
"
,,
1,6,"You have a homosexuaI attraction
"
,,
1,6,"to Potsie.
"
,,
1,6,"Anything on that remote lower than mute?
"
,,
1,6,"l got a surprise for you, Chris.
"
,,
1,6,"lt'll have to wait.
"
,,
1,6,"This is where the Fonz goes....
"
,,
1,6,"Take that, 1950s society! Okay, let's go.
"
,,
1,6,"Chris, this is the speed machine
"
,,
1,6,"that's gonna win you the soapbox derby.
"
,,
1,6,"But, Dad, l was supposed to build it myself.
"
,,
1,6,"lt's a rule.
"
,,
1,6,"Come on. Rules were made to be broken.
"
,,
1,6,"Here, let me show you the turbo booster.
"
,,
1,6,"Dad, what would you say if l told you
"
,,
1,6,"l didn't want to be in the Scouts?
"
,,
1,6,"l'd say come again?
"
,,
1,6,"And then l'd laugh because l said ''come.''
"
,,
1,6,"But thank God that's not the case.
"
,,
1,6,"You're a Scout.
"
,,
1,6,"And you know what that means?
"
,,
1,6,"That means l love you.
"
,,
1,6,"Meg?
"
,,
1,6,"Chris, get out of here!
"
,,
1,6,"You're not allowed in my room.
"
,,
1,6,"l thought that was just
"
,,
1,6,"when you were asleep.
"
,,
1,6,"What do you want?
"
,,
1,6,"l don't want to be in the Scouts anymore.
"
,,
1,6,"l just want to draw.
"
,,
1,6,"l was kinda hoping you could tell Dad.
"
,,
1,6,"But try and open with a joke.
"
,,
1,6,"Tell him yourself.
"
,,
1,6,"l can't.
"
,,
1,6,"l don't want to disappoint him again.
"
,,
1,6,"You remember when he tried to sneak me
"
,,
1,6,"into the County Fair?
"
,,
1,6,"One, please.
"
,,
1,6,"Wait a second! Your ass just sneezed!
"
,,
1,6,"And horses can't talk! No!
"
,,
1,6,"Nothing about this adds up at all!
"
,,
1,6,"Okay, look. Dad is really easy.
"
,,
1,6,"All you have to do is sit on his lap...
"
,,
1,6,"...give him a big kiss on the cheek,
"
,,
1,6,"look him right in the eye, and he's butter.
"
,,
1,6,"What the hell?
"
,,
1,6,"Dad, the Scouts are no fun. And l....
"
,,
1,6,"Wait a minute.
"
,,
1,6,"Chris, l am going to stand up,
"
,,
1,6,"walk out of this room...
"
,,
1,6,"...and we will never speak of this again.
"
,,
1,6,"Speed, you should not race! Ha-ha!
"
,,
1,6,"The Mach 5 is not ready! Ha-ha!
"
,,
1,6,"But Pops, l must race! Ha-ha!
"
,,
1,6,"Very well.
"
,,
1,6,"But l am not really your father! Ha-ha!
"
,,
1,6,"Okay girls, get ready...
"
,,
1,6,"...get set....
"
,,
1,6,"Please God, l don't ask you for much.
"
,,
1,6,"But let my boy win this race.
"
,,
1,6,"Do not go until l wave my flag.
"
,,
1,6,"l can't stress that enough.
"
,,
1,6,"l'll wave it once
"
,,
1,6,"just to show you how it looks.
"
,,
1,6,"CHRlS: Look out!
"
,,
1,6,"Griffin is disqualified!
"
,,
1,6,"Your boy is out of the Scouts!
"
,,
1,6,"Who died and made you President Nixon?
"
,,
1,6,"Look, it's been two years!
"
,,
1,6,"Your idiot son hasn't earned
"
,,
1,6,"a single merit badge.
"
,,
1,6,"lf you'll excuse me,
"
,,
1,6,"l've got to administer some spankings.
"
,,
1,6,"Come on. Give him a little more time.
"
,,
1,6,"All right!
"
,,
1,6,"You've got three days to earn a badge!
"
,,
1,6,"Three days! That's tomorrow!
"
,,
1,6,"We gotta get going!
"
,,
1,6,"Stewie, look what
"
,,
1,6,"Mommy made for dessert.
"
,,
1,6,"Jell-O. How exotic!
"
,,
1,6,"l feel like l'm on the deck of the QE II.
"
,,
1,6,"Me and Chris will take ours to go.
"
,,
1,6,"We've only got one more night
"
,,
1,6,"to get that badge.
"
,,
1,6,"Dad, maybe we should just give up.
"
,,
1,6,"l mean, we tried everything.
"
,,
1,6,"We almost got that one for insect study.
"
,,
1,6,"Look, Chris. lt's a whole family of WASPs.
"
,,
1,6,"My, Margaret. What a sub-par ham.
"
,,
1,6,"Perhaps l can't bake a ham.
"
,,
1,6,"But what l can cook up
"
,,
1,6,"is a little grace and civility at the table.
"
,,
1,6,"Patty, did you know that your mother
"
,,
1,6,"is a whore?
"
,,
1,6,"l think it's great that you and Chris've been
"
,,
1,6,"spending so much time together.
"
,,
1,6,"But he's the one
"
,,
1,6,"who should be earning that badge.
"
,,
1,6,"Where do you get off telling me
"
,,
1,6,"how to raise my son?
"
,,
1,6,"Right. Okay. We'll try it your way, honey.
"
,,
1,6,"There's my Scout!
"
,,
1,6,"Not anymore, Dad. l'm out.
"
,,
1,6,"They made me turn in my uniform
"
,,
1,6,"and everything.
"
,,
1,6,"What? Those bastards!
"
,,
1,6,"Don't you worry. l'll get you back in!
"
,,
1,6,"lt's okay, Dad. l'm not really--
"
,,
1,6,"Don't take no for an answer, Chris.
"
,,
1,6,"You're a Griffin.
"
,,
1,6,"And a Griffin never knows when to stop.
"
,,
1,6,"Clear!
"
,,
1,6,"Clear!
"
,,
1,6,"You saved my life, Doctor!
"
,,
1,6,"Clear!
"
,,
1,6,"l'm calling that troop leader.
"
,,
1,6,"We're going over his head.
"
,,
1,6,"Straight to the Scout head office
"
,,
1,6,"in New York.
"
,,
1,6,"Pack your bags, you guys!
"
,,
1,6,"The Griffins are hitting the Big Apple!
"
,,
1,6,"Ha-ha! Did you hear?
"
,,
1,6,"The Griffins are going to New York!
"
,,
1,6,"This does not affect us at all. Ha-ha!
"
,,
1,6,"l can't believe we're going to New York.
"
,,
1,6,"Dad, you don't really have to do this.
"
,,
1,6,"Yes, l do. No boy of mine is gonna get
"
,,
1,6,"booted out of the Scouts.
"
,,
1,6,"What the hell do you think you're doing?
"
,,
1,6,"Strapping you in, honey,
"
,,
1,6,"so you don't get hurt.
"
,,
1,6,"So l don't get hurt.
"
,,
1,6,"That's the best you can do,
"
,,
1,6,"you dull-witted termagant?
"
,,
1,6,"l brought your Raffi tape.
"
,,
1,6,"Play WheeIs on the Bus
"
,,
1,6,"and get the hell out of my sight.
"
,,
1,6,"Where's Brian?
"
,,
1,6,"Aren't you coming?
"
,,
1,6,"No, thanks. l've been to New York.
"
,,
1,6,"lt's like Prague sans the whimsy.
"
,,
1,6,"Will you be okay by yourself?.
"
,,
1,6,"l think l'll manage.
"
,,
1,6,"All right, you guys. We're off!
"
,,
1,6,"Those Scouts are never gonna know
"
,,
1,6,"what hit them.
"
,,
1,6,"And neither will that guy.
"
,,
1,6,"Okay. l'm thinking of a movie.
"
,,
1,6,"ls it an action movie?
"
,,
1,6,"No.
"
,,
1,6,"ls it a musical?
"
,,
1,6,"No.
"
,,
1,6,"ls it a good movie?
"
,,
1,6,"lt has its moments.
"
,,
1,6,"CooI Runnings.
"
,,
1,6,"Right!
"
,,
1,6,"After years of study, I've discovered
"
,,
1,6,"the secret to Ionger Iife in canines.
"
,,
1,6,"And that secret is--
"
,,
1,6,"We interrupt this program
"
,,
1,6,"for some episodes of One Day at a Time.
"
,,
1,6,"Damn it, JuIie. I'm a singIe mother
"
,,
1,6,"doing the best damn job she knows how!
"
,,
1,6,"And damn it, Schneider!
"
,,
1,6,"I asked you to fix
"
,,
1,6,"that damn sink two days ago!
"
,,
1,6,"I'II fix your sink, Miss Romano.
"
,,
1,6,"And by that I mean I'II have sex with you.
"
,,
1,6,"And by that, I mean I'II fix your sink.
"
,,
1,6,"And by ''sink, '' I mean
"
,,
1,6,"your reproductive organ.
"
,,
1,6,"And by ''reproductive organ, ''
"
,,
1,6,"I mean the thing between your knees.
"
,,
1,6,"And by ''the thing between your knees, '' I....
"
,,
1,6,"I guess that one's kind of seIf-expIanatory.
"
,,
1,6,"Peter, we're lost.
"
,,
1,6,"Would you please ask for directions?
"
,,
1,6,"We are not lost. And even if we were...
"
,,
1,6,"...l can't ask a human being for directions.
"
,,
1,6,"Why not?
"
,,
1,6,"Because l'm a man.
"
,,
1,6,"Haven't you ever seen
"
,,
1,6,"a stand-up comedian, Lois?
"
,,
1,6,"Dad, maybe we should go home.
"
,,
1,6,"No way.
"
,,
1,6,"We came to get you back into the Scouts.
"
,,
1,6,"And that's exactly what we're gonna do.
"
,,
1,6,"What was that?
"
,,
1,6,"Nothing.
"
,,
1,6,"Peter, the car is making funny noises.
"
,,
1,6,"You're wrong again, Lois.
"
,,
1,6,"That wasn't the car.
"
,,
1,6,"Although you were right
"
,,
1,6,"about that prune smoothie.
"
,,
1,6,"Are you okay?
"
,,
1,6,"l'll be fine.
"
,,
1,6,"l just have to concentrate on driving.
"
,,
1,6,"Come on! That one's not even real!
"
,,
1,6,"God! We gotta stop!
"
,,
1,6,"Wow! An lndian casino!
"
,,
1,6,"Yeah. l gotta find me the stink lodge!
"
,,
1,6,"Come on, you guys. No time to lose!
"
,,
1,6,"Hold it.
"
,,
1,6,"Hold it!
"
,,
1,6,"Hold it!
"
,,
1,6,"AUTOMATED lNDlAN: WeIcome
"
,,
1,6,"to our casino, paIefaces.
"
,,
1,6,"FeeI free to visit gift shop in Iobby
"
,,
1,6,"and restaurant on second fIoor.
"
,,
1,6,"Do you have reservations?
"
,,
1,6,"OnIy about the veaI!
"
,,
1,6,"This is gonna be a photo finish, Lois!
"
,,
1,6,"l'm gonna ask someone for directions.
"
,,
1,6,"Meg, watch Stewie.
"
,,
1,6,"Excuse me.
"
,,
1,6,"Can you tell me how to get to New York?
"
,,
1,6,"Sure. But what's your hurry, ma'am?
"
,,
1,6,"Don't you want to play first?
"
,,
1,6,"Thank you.
"
,,
1,6,"But l really don't approve of gambling.
"
,,
1,6,"Technically it's not really gambling.
"
,,
1,6,"We're trying to rebuild
"
,,
1,6,"our shattered culture...
"
,,
1,6,"...after you raped our land
"
,,
1,6,"and defiled our women.
"
,,
1,6,"As long as you're not using it for firewater.
"
,,
1,6,"Look, a bow tie.
"
,,
1,6,"l'm David Bowie.
"
,,
1,6,"Bo Derek!
"
,,
1,6,"Very funny!
"
,,
1,6,"Now tell the one that doesn't suck!
"
,,
1,6,"Thank you. Yes.
"
,,
1,6,"And what's the deal with airline food?
"
,,
1,6,"Thanks, ''Watches You Pee.''
"
,,
1,6,"Where's your mother?
"
,,
1,6,"Over there.
"
,,
1,6,"l didn't know you knew how to play poker.
"
,,
1,6,"Yeah.
"
,,
1,6,"How you doing?
"
,,
1,6,"Yeah.
"
,,
1,6,"That's good, honey. Let's go.
"
,,
1,6,"Yeah.
"
,,
1,6,"lt's funny. l never knew video poker
"
,,
1,6,"could be so much fun.
"
,,
1,6,"You win a few hands
"
,,
1,6,"and all those lights go off.
"
,,
1,6,"And you just feel so good inside.
"
,,
1,6,"Yeah, gambling is great.
"
,,
1,6,"No question about it.
"
,,
1,6,"lt felt so good. l kept putting my money in.
"
,,
1,6,"And before l knew it, l'd lost $40.
"
,,
1,6,"l'm so embarrassed.
"
,,
1,6,"That's okay.
"
,,
1,6,"As long as you learned your lesson.
"
,,
1,6,"l did, Peter, for a couple of minutes.
"
,,
1,6,"Then....
"
,,
1,6,"This is so silly. l started playing again.
"
,,
1,6,"l could swear l parked here.
"
,,
1,6,"Yeah, you did.
"
,,
1,6,"But here's the really silly thing, Peter.
"
,,
1,6,"l sort of bet our car.
"
,,
1,6,"l won't panic.
"
,,
1,6,"l need to go back in the casino...
"
,,
1,6,"...and find a high roller who'll pay
"
,,
1,6,"$1 million to sleep with my wife.
"
,,
1,6,"What? That's ridiculous!
"
,,
1,6,"These people took $24
"
,,
1,6,"for the island of Manhattan.
"
,,
1,6,"They have no idea what things are worth!
"
,,
1,6,"Nice going, Mom.
"
,,
1,6,"l finally get my driver's license
"
,,
1,6,"and you lose the car to a poker machine.
"
,,
1,6,"How ironic.
"
,,
1,6,"Don't talk about your mother that way.
"
,,
1,6,"She is not an iron.
"
,,
1,6,"We gotta figure out a way
"
,,
1,6,"to get to New York...
"
,,
1,6,"...and get Chris back into the Scouts.
"
,,
1,6,"But Dad--
"
,,
1,6,"l got it.
"
,,
1,6,"l'll just get Brian to wire us some money.
"
,,
1,6,"Damn it, JuIie!
"
,,
1,6,"I am not shacking up with my boyfriend.
"
,,
1,6,"I am just going away for the weekend.
"
,,
1,6,"SCHNElDER: Yeah. AII the away.
"
,,
1,6,"Damn, Schneider! What won't you say?
"
,,
1,6,"No answer at the house.
"
,,
1,6,"You didn't bet that, too, did you?
"
,,
1,6,"l'm sorry, Peter. l feel so foolish.
"
,,
1,6,"lt just seemed like such a good cause.
"
,,
1,6,"Everyone in the tribe gets a share
"
,,
1,6,"in the casino's profits.
"
,,
1,6,"What did you just say?
"
,,
1,6,"''l'm sorry.''
"
,,
1,6,"After that.
"
,,
1,6,"''l feel foolish.''
"
,,
1,6,"After that.
"
,,
1,6,"''Casino's profits.''
"
,,
1,6,"Before that.
"
,,
1,6,"''Everyone in the tribe.''
"
,,
1,6,"The whole thing.
"
,,
1,6,"''Everyone in the tribe shares the profit?''
"
,,
1,6,"That's it! Let's go!
"
,,
1,6,"l'm sorry to hear about your misfortune.
"
,,
1,6,"But we're not allowed
"
,,
1,6,"to return gambling losses.
"
,,
1,6,"l think you can make an exception
"
,,
1,6,"in our case, Lenny. See, l'm an lndian, too.
"
,,
1,6,"LENNY AND LOlS: Excuse me?
"
,,
1,6,"You heard me. l'm a member of your tribe.
"
,,
1,6,"And that entitles me to a share
"
,,
1,6,"of your wampum, kemosabe.
"
,,
1,6,"Whoa. Wait a second. Not so fast.
"
,,
1,6,"Tell me of your history, of your past.
"
,,
1,6,"l come from a long line of you people.
"
,,
1,6,"My great-grandfather's name
"
,,
1,6,"was Jeep Grand Cherokee.
"
,,
1,6,"l mean, Chief Grand Cherokee.
"
,,
1,6,"He was a rainmaker.
"
,,
1,6,"''l'm so happy doing the neutron dance
"
,,
1,6,"''l'm just burning doing the neutron dance''
"
,,
1,6,"And he also killed a bunch of Krauts
"
,,
1,6,"at Wounded Knee.
"
,,
1,6,"So are you gonna
"
,,
1,6,"give me back my car, or what?
"
,,
1,6,"l have to confer with the council
"
,,
1,6,"of the elders. You wait here.
"
,,
1,6,"Are you nuts, Peter?
"
,,
1,6,"You'll never get away with this.
"
,,
1,6,"Why not? l've fooled people before.
"
,,
1,6,"You remember that time
"
,,
1,6,"l pretended to be gay?
"
,,
1,6,"There is no way
"
,,
1,6,"they're gonna believe you're an lndian.
"
,,
1,6,"He's an lndian.
"
,,
1,6,"How do you know?
"
,,
1,6,"l can tell.
"
,,
1,6,"You think everyone's an lndian.
"
,,
1,6,"He could just be another moocher.
"
,,
1,6,"Maybe we can put him through a test.
"
,,
1,6,"Like a really impossible stunt
"
,,
1,6,"to prove he's the real deal.
"
,,
1,6,"Way to think outside the box, Frank.
"
,,
1,6,"To prove you are truly a member
"
,,
1,6,"of our tribe, you must go on a vision quest.
"
,,
1,6,"Do you know what a vision quest is?
"
,,
1,6,"Of course l do. l'm an lndian.
"
,,
1,6,"But why don't you explain it to my wife?
"
,,
1,6,"She's a little slow in the head.
"
,,
1,6,"A vision quest is a sacred spiritual journey.
"
,,
1,6,"Your husband must go out
"
,,
1,6,"in the wilderness without food or water.
"
,,
1,6,"Or shoes.
"
,,
1,6,"Yeah. Or shoes.
"
,,
1,6,"He must remain there
"
,,
1,6,"until he can communicate with nature.
"
,,
1,6,"He must hear the wisdom
"
,,
1,6,"of the rocks and trees.
"
,,
1,6,"And then his guiding spirit
"
,,
1,6,"must appear to him...
"
,,
1,6,"...and reveal a great personal truth.
"
,,
1,6,"And it's gotta be a real vision.
"
,,
1,6,"We're lndians.
"
,,
1,6,"We're gonna know if he's lying.
"
,,
1,6,"Sucker.
"
,,
1,6,"LOlS: Peter, please don't do this.
"
,,
1,6,"We can buy another car.
"
,,
1,6,"l'll give extra piano lessons on Sundays.
"
,,
1,6,"Come on.
"
,,
1,6,"All l gotta do is have a spiritual vision.
"
,,
1,6,"l've had one before.
"
,,
1,6,"Oh, my God, Brian.
"
,,
1,6,"There's a message in my Alpha Bits.
"
,,
1,6,"lt says ''Ooooo.''
"
,,
1,6,"Peter, those are Cheerios.
"
,,
1,6,"You must begin your journey now.
"
,,
1,6,"Now's your chance to be alone with Dad.
"
,,
1,6,"Are you nuts? l'm not attracted to Dad.
"
,,
1,6,"Tell him you don't want to be in Scouts.
"
,,
1,6,"Thanks, Meg.
"
,,
1,6,"Yipes.
"
,,
1,6,"Dad, can l come?
"
,,
1,6,"How about it, Lenny?
"
,,
1,6,"What the hey? The more the merrier.
"
,,
1,6,"Now get the hell out of here, you nut,
"
,,
1,6,"and go have yourself a spiritual vision.
"
,,
1,6,"Water! Thank God!
"
,,
1,6,"CHRlS: Dad, l'm hungry. Are we gonna die?
"
,,
1,6,"Of course not.
"
,,
1,6,"This isn't the first time
"
,,
1,6,"l found my own food in the wild.
"
,,
1,6,"Dumb broad.
"
,,
1,6,"They've been gone for over six hours.
"
,,
1,6,"How long do these vision quests
"
,,
1,6,"usually take?
"
,,
1,6,"lt varies.
"
,,
1,6,"lt depends on the person's age,
"
,,
1,6,"and height, and sign.
"
,,
1,6,"You have no idea, do you?
"
,,
1,6,"Of course l.... No.
"
,,
1,6,"Why would you send
"
,,
1,6,"my husband and son out...
"
,,
1,6,"...into the wilderness without
"
,,
1,6,"any food or supplies?
"
,,
1,6,"Because we really like your car?
"
,,
1,6,"They're dead, you know.
"
,,
1,6,"Must eat. Haven't snacked in hours.
"
,,
1,6,"Can't feel my eyes.
"
,,
1,6,"Wonder if club-footed midgets
"
,,
1,6,"get justice in heaven.
"
,,
1,6,"Hot enough for you?
"
,,
1,6,"What?
"
,,
1,6,"l say, ''Hot enough for you?''
"
,,
1,6,"Yeah. l guess. Oh, my God!
"
,,
1,6,"l'm communicating with nature!
"
,,
1,6,"Tree, if one of you falls and there's
"
,,
1,6,"no one around, do you make a noise?
"
,,
1,6,"Are you kidding? Scott fell last week.
"
,,
1,6,"He hasn't shut up about it since.
"
,,
1,6,"Sure. Stand there and bitch!
"
,,
1,6,"But would any of you take the time
"
,,
1,6,"to help me?
"
,,
1,6,"l'm playing
"
,,
1,6,"the world's smallest violin, Scott.
"
,,
1,6,"FONZlE: Yo, Griffin!
"
,,
1,6,"The Fonz!
"
,,
1,6,"What are you doing here?
"
,,
1,6,"Shouldn't you be in the middle
"
,,
1,6,"of a Tuscadero sandwich?
"
,,
1,6,"Yeah. But l'm your spiritual guide, see?
"
,,
1,6,"l want to lay a little personal truth on you.
"
,,
1,6,"Now, Mr. C was like a father to me.
"
,,
1,6,"And he always listened, you know?
"
,,
1,6,"And Griffin, right now, your son needs
"
,,
1,6,"you to listen to him. Whoa!
"
,,
1,6,"Sure. Whatever you say. Fonzie?
"
,,
1,6,"There's something l always wanted
"
,,
1,6,"to ask you. You were with a lot of girls.
"
,,
1,6,"Did you ever get a sexual disease?
"
,,
1,6,"Herpes twice. And the clap.
"
,,
1,6,"Dad? Can l talk to you?
"
,,
1,6,"Not now, son!
"
,,
1,6,"Sure. Go right ahead.
"
,,
1,6,"Sure. Go right ahead.
"
,,
1,6,"l don't want to be a Scout, Dad.
"
,,
1,6,"l just don't have fun there.
"
,,
1,6,"l guess you're pretty disappointed in me.
"
,,
1,6,"Yeah!
"
,,
1,6,"Dad, this is what l really like to do.
"
,,
1,6,"What? You want to draw?
"
,,
1,6,"Son, why don't you
"
,,
1,6,"just stick a knife in my heart?
"
,,
1,6,"l mean, so you drew this?
"
,,
1,6,"Yeah. l know they suck.
"
,,
1,6,"Not all of them.
"
,,
1,6,"Some of these look pretty good.
"
,,
1,6,"Really?
"
,,
1,6,"Yeah!
"
,,
1,6,"l didn't know anyone in this family
"
,,
1,6,"had any talent.
"
,,
1,6,"Except for that one thing
"
,,
1,6,"your mother does.
"
,,
1,6,"You mean play the piano?
"
,,
1,6,"No. She.... Yeah.
"
,,
1,6,"l probably don't say this often enough.
"
,,
1,6,"But l'm really proud of you, Chris.
"
,,
1,6,"Thanks, Dad.
"
,,
1,6,"''And the cat's in the cradle
"
,,
1,6,"with the silver spoon
"
,,

"
,,
1,6,"You know we'll have a--''
"
,,
1,6,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
1,6,"Fire!
"
,,
1,6,"Let's get out of here!
"
,,
1,6,"Run, you stupid bastards!
"
,,
1,6,"Peter? Chris? Thank God. Are you okay?
"
,,
1,6,"Fantastic, Lois! l saw my guiding spirit.
"
,,
1,6,"Whoa! Wait a second! You had a vision?
"
,,
1,6,"lt was amazing! l spoke to the trees.
"
,,
1,6,"And l saw the Fonz.
"
,,
1,6,"Really? What's the Fonz like?
"
,,
1,6,"l bet he's stuck up.
"
,,
1,6,"A little. But thanks to him,
"
,,
1,6,"me and Chris have never been closer.
"
,,
1,6,"l want a spiritual vision, too! Man!
"
,,
1,6,"l guess we've lost touch
"
,,
1,6,"with our noble roots.
"
,,
1,6,"l mean, sure this casino's brought
"
,,
1,6,"our tribe money and prosperity.
"
,,
1,6,"But what is the price of our souls?
"
,,
1,6,"$6 million a week.
"
,,
1,6,"That sounds right.
"
,,
1,6,"Take your crappy car back.
"
,,
1,6,"Come on, boys. Let's go hit the buffet.
"
,,
1,6,"All right! We did it!
"
,,
1,6,"Let's get the hell out of here.
"
,,
1,6,"Stupid, greedy savages!
"
,,
1,6,"Stewie, that's a terrible thing to say.
"
,,
1,6,"This one particular tribe has lost their way.
"
,,
1,6,"But most Native Americans are proud...
"
,,
1,6,"...hardworking people
"
,,
1,6,"who are true to their spiritual heritage.
"
,,
1,6,"They are certainly not savages.
"
,,
1,6,"That's funny, Mother.
"
,,
1,6,"Just this morning you said they were lazy
"
,,
1,6,"like the dirty Mexicans. Just kidding.
"
,,
1,6,"The Mexicans are a clean and industrious
"
,,
1,6,"people with a rich cultural heritage.
"
,,
1,6,"Yeah. Not like those dumb,
"
,,
1,6,"gargantuan Swedes.
"
,,
1,6,"Actually, the Swedish people run
"
,,
1,6,"the gamut from very short to tall.
"
,,
1,6,"And did you know that Sweden gave us
"
,,
1,6,"the brilliant inventor, Alfred Nobel?
"
,,
1,6,"Yeah. Which is more than we ever got
"
,,
1,6,"from those freeloading Canadians.
"
,,
1,6,"Canada sucks.
"
,,
1,7,"Come on, everyone.
"
,,
1,7,"The Eight is Enough reunion show
"
,,
1,7,"is about to start.
"
,,
1,7,"Mary, have you seen Nicholas?
"
,,
1,7,"He's up in his room sulking, Dad.
"
,,
1,7,"Yeah. He's still upset
"
,,
1,7,"because Abby threw out his baseball cards.
"
,,
1,7,"Maybe I should make him a sandwich.
"
,,
1,7,"Dad. That's your solution to everything.
"
,,
1,7,"Dad!
"
,,
1,7,"What?
"
,,
1,7,"Eight is enough.
"
,,
1,7,"You know, I love you girls.

"
,,
1,7,"Will you be prancing then?
"
,,
1,7,"You just want to eat him up.
"
,,
1,7,"It is so hot out there!
"
,,
1,7,"How hot is it?
"
,,
1,7,"I don't know. Like, around 98, 99.
"
,,
1,7,"I don't get it.
"
,,
1,7,"I think I'm a little sweaty.
"
,,
1,7,"You! You seem to know all the players
"
,,
1,7,"in this poorly-acted farce.
"
,,
1,7,"What do they call that one?
"
,,
1,7,"That's Meg, dude. You know that.
"
,,
1,7,"Meg! You vile-smelling girl,
"
,,
1,7,"you're not to touch any of my things!
"
,,
1,7,"You understand me? Dirty girl.
"
,,
1,7,"Meanwhile, here at home...
"
,,
1,7,"...Quahog remains in the sweltering grip
"
,,
1,7,"of a freak heat wave.
"
,,
1,7,"I don't think you should use
"
,,
1,7,"the word ""freak"".
"
,,
1,7,"Some people might find it offensive.
"
,,
1,7," Finish your oatmeal, son.
"
,,
1,7," Why bother? I'm just a freak!
"
,,
1,7,"We're all a little different, Diane.
"
,,
1,7,"Each of us.
"
,,
1,7,"Good point.
"
,,
1,7,"We're even feeling the effects
"
,,
1,7,"of this heat wave here in our studio.
"
,,
1,7,"Freak.
"
,,
1,7,"So stay inside and stay cool.
"
,,
1,7,"I think I saw one of her nipples!
"
,,
1,7,"Chris, that's a terrible word! ""Nipple.""
"
,,
1,7,"I'll chalk that up to the heat, mister.
"
,,
1,7,"Am I to strut about all day like
"
,,
1,7,"a beggar child on the streets of Calcutta?
"
,,
1,7,"Fetch me something linen to throw on
"
,,
1,7,"before I call Child Services!
"
,,
1,7,"Please don't threaten Mommy.
"
,,
1,7,"She's very hot.
"
,,
1,7,"Chris, you're hogging up all the fans!
"
,,
1,7,"Yeah? You're hogging up all the ugly!
"
,,
1,7,"Check this out, you guys.
"
,,
1,7,"The Rhode Island Dog Show
"
,,
1,7,"Championship is in Quahog this year!
"
,,
1,7," First prize is $500!
"
,,
1,7," Really?
"
,,
1,7,"If you won, we could use that money
"
,,
1,7,"for a new air conditioner.
"
,,
1,7,"Brian. You could win for sure.
"
,,
1,7,"You could do your impression
"
,,
1,7,"of a barbershop quartet.
"
,,
1,7,"""We were sailing along
"
,,
1,7,"""On Moonlight Bay
"
,,
1,7,"""We could hear the voices singing
"
,,
1,7,"""They seemed to say""
"
,,
1,7,"Sorry. I don't do dog shows.
"
,,
1,7,"It's not my thing.
"
,,
1,7,"Come on.
"
,,
1,7,"All you gotta do is a few simple commands.
"
,,
1,7,"And maybe a trick or two.
"
,,
1,7,"It'll be like taking candy from a baby.
"
,,
1,7,"Please, Brian.
"
,,
1,7,"I don't know. I mean
"
,,
1,7,"I don't even know where my papers are.
"
,,
1,7,"Can't you get the money another way?
"
,,
1,7,"I've been trying.
"
,,
1,7,"That's why I went on that game show.
"
,,
1,7,"For $800, this chemical dye is found
"
,,
1,7,"in over 95% of all cosmetic products.
"
,,
1,7,"Diarrhea.
"
,,
1,7,"What?
"
,,
1,7,"Sorry. What is Diarrhea?
"
,,
1,7,"Come on, Brian.
"
,,
1,7,"We really need a new air conditioner.
"
,,
1,7,"Okay, let's go over the commands.
"
,,
1,7,"Sit.
"
,,
1,7,"Good. Roll over.
"
,,
1,7,"I'm already shvitzing like crazy here.
"
,,
1,7,"Let's call it a night.
"
,,
1,7,"Do you want to win this thing or not?
"
,,
1,7,"We haven't even talked
"
,,
1,7,"about how you'll wear your ears.
"
,,
1,7,"I was thinking up.
"
,,
1,7,"I need a cocktail.
"
,,
1,7,"Don't push too hard, Peter.
"
,,
1,7,"You gotta take Brian's feelings
"
,,
1,7,"into consideration.
"
,,
1,7,"After all, it's only a dog show.
"
,,
1,7,"Lois, honey, I love you...
"
,,
1,7,"...but you're sucking all the energy
"
,,
1,7,"out of the room.
"
,,
1,7,"Come.
"
,,
1,7,"I got you a little something for the show.
"
,,
1,7,"It's Italian. Do you like it?
"
,,
1,7,"It's exquisite.
"
,,
1,7,"It's not for every day.
"
,,
1,7,"Clearly. I'm gonna put it on right now.
"
,,
1,7,"I know how hard you've been working.
"
,,
1,7,"And the whole family appreciates it.
"
,,
1,7,"Thank you, Lois.
"
,,
1,7,"I should go. We'll be waiting downstairs
"
,,
1,7,"whenever you're ready.
"
,,
1,7,"And Brian...
"
,,
1,7,"...you look very handsome.
"
,,
1,7,"Showtime!
"
,,
1,7,"Welcome to the Quahog Dog
"
,,
1,7,"Show. Today's competition will be...
"
,,
1,7,"...almost as hot as the weather,
"
,,
1,7,"which is once again in the triple digits.
"
,,
1,7,"...almost as hot as the weather,
"
,,
1,7,"which is once again in the triple digits.
"
,,
1,7,"Peter, I'm not really comfortable
"
,,
1,7,"with all this.
"
,,
1,7,"Do I know you?
"
,,
1,7,"I don't think I can do this.
"
,,
1,7,"You can't back out now. How about a pill?
"
,,
1,7," Something to relax you before you go on?
"
,,
1,7," Peter, are you offering Brian drugs?
"
,,
1,7,"Not drugs. Just a little blue thing
"
,,
1,7,"celebrities take to help them perform.
"
,,
1,7,"Well, those celebrities are wrong!
"
,,
1,7,"Lois, if Liza is wrong,
"
,,
1,7,"then I don't want to know what right is.
"
,,
1,7,"Two minutes to curtain, Miss Minnelli!
"
,,
1,7,"Come on, baby! Mama's gotta sparkle!
"
,,
1,7,"It's time to make life a cabaret!
"
,,
1,7,"Lady, for God's sake, I'm just
"
,,
1,7,"a hard-shelled chocolate candy! Get help!
"
,,
1,7,"You there, child-woman!
"
,,
1,7,"I'll give you a shiny dime
"
,,
1,7,"if you'll roll me into the nearest lake.
"
,,
1,7,"Let me see if I can find you a juice box.
"
,,
1,7,"And get the lead out, pudgy!
"
,,
1,7,"Next, Peter Griffin and his dog, ""Brain"".
"
,,
1,7,"We're off to a good start.
"
,,
1,7,"A beautiful performance
"
,,
1,7,"from ""Brain"" Griffin!
"
,,
1,7,"Go, Brian!
"
,,
1,7,"All right, Brian. We got it all sewn up.
"
,,
1,7,"What the hell is this?
"
,,
1,7,"This? This is the part
"
,,
1,7,"where you beg for a treat.
"
,,
1,7,"I don't think so.
"
,,
1,7,"Brian, you're embarrassing me.
"
,,
1,7,"God, he can't expect Brian to do that.
"
,,
1,7,"It's easier than it looks, Mom.
"
,,
1,7,"Come on, Brian. We had a deal.
"
,,
1,7,"Yeah? The deal's off.
"
,,
1,7,"Me and the little shred of dignity I have left
"
,,
1,7,"will be waiting in the car!
"
,,
1,7,"Brian, come! Don't you walk out on me!
"
,,
1,7,"I now command you to leave.
"
,,
1,7,"Keep going. Yeah, that's right.
"
,,
1,7,"Yeah, flip me off. Good boy.
"
,,
1,7,"How could you let me down
"
,,
1,7,"like that, Brian?
"
,,
1,7,"I let you down?
"
,,
1,7,"Because I refused to demean myself...
"
,,
1,7,"...by perpetuating the stereotype
"
,,
1,7,"of the good dog?
"
,,
1,7,"This is the one thing I ever asked you
"
,,
1,7,"to do for us.
"
,,
1,7,"This and not do that thing where you
"
,,
1,7,"drag your ass across the carpet.
"
,,
1,7,"One time I did that!
"
,,
1,7,"Peter, Brian, please.
"
,,
1,7,"Let's just have a nice family car ride
"
,,
1,7,"like we always do.
"
,,
1,7,"Yeah.
"
,,
1,7,"Except for the time Dad hit that deer.
"
,,
1,7,"Yeah, it looks like it's just a ding.
"
,,
1,7,"There's no reason to involve
"
,,
1,7,"the insurance companies.
"
,,
1,7,"I should still take down your information.
"
,,
1,7,"Really? You could probably just
"
,,
1,7,"buff that out.
"
,,
1,7,"Yeah, but I...
"
,,
1,7,"I would really feel better
"
,,
1,7,"if I got your information.
"
,,
1,7,"Brian, maybe I had you pegged wrong.
"
,,
1,7,"Maybe you really don't care
"
,,
1,7,"about this family.
"
,,
1,7,"If you cared about me, you'd never
"
,,
1,7,"ask me to do something so degrading.
"
,,
1,7,"The next time I ask you to do something,
"
,,
1,7,"I expect you to do it. Understand?
"
,,
1,7,"Who wants to sing show tunes? ""In old...""
"
,,
1,7,"Stop the car.
"
,,
1,7,"Is that what you want?
"
,,
1,7,"Because I'll stop.
"
,,
1,7,"Pull over now.
"
,,
1,7,"Fine.
"
,,
1,7,"God. Brian, don't do this.
"
,,
1,7,"Is the doggie going bye-bye? I'm so sad.
"
,,
1,7,"Quick! Back up!
"
,,
1,7,"Great. Is there a problem, Officer?
"
,,
1,7,"Can I see your license, boy?
"
,,
1,7,"""Boy""?
"
,,
1,7,"Oh, God. I left it on my other collar.
"
,,
1,7," You been chasing cars tonight, boy?
"
,,
1,7," Look, the name is Brian.
"
,,
1,7," I was just out for a little walk. That's all.
"
,,
1,7," Without a leash.
"
,,
1,7,"I'm gonna have to ask you to lie down
"
,,
1,7,"on the sidewalk. Down!
"
,,
1,7,"I don't believe this.
"
,,
1,7,"I don't suppose you could let us off
"
,,
1,7,"with a warning?
"
,,
1,7,"Sorry, sir.
"
,,
1,7,"But leash laws are for his own good.
"
,,
1,7,"The fine is $10.
"
,,
1,7,"You behave, little fella, you hear me?
"
,,
1,7,"Lordy, I'll never roam again!
"
,,
1,7,"Jackass.
"
,,
1,7,"He's the law outside this house
"
,,
1,7,"just like I'm the law inside this house.
"
,,
1,7," And you better start obeying both of us.
"
,,
1,7," Look at you.
"
,,
1,7,"Big man, can't even afford to buy
"
,,
1,7,"an air conditioner for your family.
"
,,
1,7,"What a bitch.
"
,,
1,7,"Good morning Quahog.
"
,,
1,7,"The heat wave has finally broken.
"
,,
1,7,"It sure has. You know what they say,
"
,,
1,7,"""If you don't like...
"
,,
1,7,"""...the weather in New England,
"
,,
1,7,"go back where you came from.""
"
,,
1,7,"I don't think that's the expression.
"
,,
1,7,"I guess I had too many
"
,,
1,7,"bloody marys this morning. But anyway...
"
,,
1,7,"God. I hope the boss isn't watching.
"
,,
1,7,"I don't know how those two manage
"
,,
1,7,"to be so perky in the morning.
"
,,
1,7,"Something smells good.
"
,,
1,7,"Homemade cinnamon buns
"
,,
1,7,"fresh from the tube.
"
,,
1,7,"Nothing says ""I love you""
"
,,
1,7,"like something from...
"
,,
1,7,"What the hell are you doing,
"
,,
1,7,"you crazy bitch?
"
,,
1,7,"These oughta cheer Brian up.
"
,,
1,7,"Cinnamon buns are his favorite.
"
,,
1,7,"Really?
"
,,
1,7,"I could've sworn his favorite was
"
,,
1,7,"""treat Peter like crap"" buns.
"
,,
1,7,"Good morning, Brian.
"
,,
1,7,"My, your summer coat is really
"
,,
1,7,"coming in nicely. Isn't it, Peter?
"
,,
1,7,"Yeah. Must be that special jojoba shampoo
"
,,
1,7,"I bought you. It cost a little extra.
"
,,
1,7,"But I would do anything for you, Brian.
"
,,
1,7,"I'll be on the veranda
"
,,
1,7,"since you're already on the cross.
"
,,
1,7,"Eat with us, Brian. I made cinnamon buns.
"
,,
1,7,"May I have one on a plate or is
"
,,
1,7,"Peter planning to balance it on my nose?
"
,,
1,7,"Peter, Brian, stop this.
"
,,
1,7,"Can't you two go back to the way
"
,,
1,7,"you used to be?
"
,,
1,7,"We can't go back to the way things were
"
,,
1,7,"after how I was treated.
"
,,
1,7," Not after the things I've seen.
"
,,
1,7," What did you see? Was it breasts?
"
,,
1,7,"Get over it, Brian.
"
,,
1,7,"I mean, how bad do you really have it here?
"
,,
1,7," When I found you, you were just a stray.
"
,,
1,7," You swore you would never speak of that.
"
,,
1,7,"No, thank you. I just had it cleaned.
"
,,
1,7,"No. Jeez.
"
,,
1,7,"All set, sir.
"
,,
1,7,"I don't have any change. Sorry.
"
,,
1,7,"That's okay. No charge.
"
,,
1,7,"Wait.
"
,,
1,7,"You hungry?
"
,,
1,7,"Because my wife makes
"
,,
1,7,"this beef-a-roni casserole.
"
,,
1,7,"Out of this world.
"
,,
1,7,"Look, you got everything
"
,,
1,7,"you could possibly want right here.
"
,,
1,7,"Now just eat your cinnamon bun
"
,,
1,7,"and stop being a bad dog.
"
,,
1,7,"How dare you?
"
,,
1,7,"How dare I?
"
,,
1,7,"Where do you think you're going?
"
,,
1,7,"Out!
"
,,
1,7,"You're not going anywhere
"
,,
1,7,"without your leash!
"
,,
1,7,"I don't need your damn leash, or you!
"
,,
1,7,"I'm going for a walk.
"
,,
1,7,"Don't worry. He won't get far without this.
"
,,
1,7,"And a pack of Eldorados, unfiltered.
"
,,
1,7,"What? That. Yeah.
"
,,
1,7,"I'll clean that up on my way out.
"
,,
1,7,"See that sign?
"
,,
1,7,"Now why don't you go tie yourself
"
,,
1,7,"up to that parking meter?
"
,,
1,7,"I don't want any trouble.
"
,,
1,7,"Mom, have you ever had
"
,,
1,7,"a problem with freshness?
"
,,
1,7,"What do you mean, honey?
"
,,
1,7,"You know. Have you ever felt not so fresh?
"
,,
1,7,"I'm not sure what you're...
"
,,
1,7,"I don't follow you.
"
,,
1,7,"Have you ever felt like you're dirty?
"
,,
1,7,"Down there?
"
,,
1,7,"God, no!
"
,,
1,7,"That was Brian's favorite commercial.
"
,,
1,7,"""Brian""? No, it's not ringing a bell.
"
,,
1,7,"Stop it! We all miss him.
"
,,
1,7,"Go find him, apologize,
"
,,
1,7,"and bring him home.
"
,,
1,7,"You heard him.
"
,,
1,7,"He doesn't want to be a part of this family.
"
,,
1,7,"We don't need him. We'll get another pet.
"
,,
1,7,"No way, Dad.
"
,,
1,7,"No one can take Brian's place.
"
,,
1,7,"Silence!
"
,,
1,7,"That mongrel is probably decomposing
"
,,
1,7,"on the side of a dirt road as we speak!
"
,,
1,7," Let's get a kitty!
"
,,
1,7," See, gang? Stewie's got the right idea.
"
,,
1,7," I don't know, Peter.
"
,,
1,7," Lois, trust me.
"
,,
1,7,"We'll get a lovable kitty-cat
"
,,
1,7,"and everybody will feel a lot better.
"
,,
1,7,"Here, kitty, kitty.
"
,,
1,7,"Come on down nice and easy.
"
,,
1,7,"That's a good kitty.
"
,,
1,7,"What the hell was that?
"
,,
1,7,"Something near a window.
"
,,
1,7,"Preferably a booth.
"
,,
1,7,"Yeah, you got 50 Puerto Ricans
"
,,
1,7,"in the kitchen!
"
,,
1,7,"Yeah, that's authentic Italian.
"
,,
1,7,"Don't do that.
"
,,
1,7,"That's what they expect you to do.
"
,,
1,7,"Okay, fine for you.
"
,,
1,7,"But what about your puppies?
"
,,
1,7,"And your puppies' puppies?
"
,,
1,7,"Am I the only one who's outraged here?
"
,,
1,7,"I'm sorry. Enjoy your dinner.
"
,,
1,7,"How come you're still setting
"
,,
1,7,"a place for Brian?
"
,,
1,7,"Because when he comes home, I want
"
,,
1,7,"him to know he never left our thoughts.
"
,,
1,7,"I know you're thinking about him,
"
,,
1,7,"too, Peter.
"
,,
1,7,"Look, Lois, he broke his promise to me.
"
,,
1,7,"Besides, we have a new pet.
"
,,
1,7,"And we love our fluffy kitty.
"
,,
1,7,"Gross. Did he just drink from the fountain?
"
,,
1,7,"Hey, you!
"
,,
1,7,"Stay!
"
,,
1,7,"Joyce DeWitt?
"
,,
1,7,"So that's where you've been.
"
,,
1,7,"Sorry, pooch. You gotta sleep outside.
"
,,
1,7,"No dogs allowed in the bus station.
"
,,
1,7,"My blind guy's in the john.
"
,,
1,7,"I'll point him in your direction.
"
,,
1,7,"Brian's tennis ball.
"
,,
1,7,"Man, he loved to play with this thing.
"
,,
1,7,"Double fault!
"
,,
1,7,"Come on, Brian.
"
,,
1,7,"Peter, why don't you
"
,,
1,7,"just admit you miss Brian?
"
,,
1,7,"You're right, Lois. Who am I kidding?
"
,,
1,7,"This family needs Brian. I need him.
"
,,
1,7,"God, I hate this freaking cat.
"
,,
1,7,"Can you spare some change?
"
,,
1,7,"Why? So you can go buy yourself
"
,,
1,7,"another bottle of booze?
"
,,
1,7,"Why don't you make something
"
,,
1,7,"of your life, like this dog?
"
,,
1,7,"That's me! I mean, that was me.
"
,,
1,7,"Yeah, sure.
"
,,
1,7,"No, I mean it. That was me.
"
,,
1,7,"Get away from me, you crazy animal!
"
,,
1,7,"You want me to be a crazy animal?
"
,,
1,7,"Okay, I'm a crazy animal!
"
,,
1,7,"Stop! Help!
"
,,
1,7,"Help!
"
,,
1,7,"All right, who wants to be next?
"
,,
1,7,"You? You?
"
,,
1,7,"Brian!
"
,,
1,7,"I'm here to bring you...
"
,,
1,7,"You're going downtown, pal.
"
,,
1,7,"...home.
"
,,
1,7,"Hi. How's it going?
"
,,
1,7,"Oh, God. I know karate!
"
,,
1,7,"Look! A tasty little baby!
"
,,
1,7,"I see somebody's been neutered.
"
,,
1,7,"Come on, sugar. It's time.
"
,,
1,7,"Thank God.
"
,,
1,7,"He's cute. Aren't you precious?
"
,,
1,7,"Lethal injection. Next!
"
,,
1,7," What?
"
,,
1,7," Oh, no!
"
,,
1,7,"You can't do this!
"
,,
1,7,"Who's up for a little lunch?
"
,,
1,7,"Something festive.
"
,,
1,7,"Did someone say Tex-Mex?
"
,,
1,7,"I'm sorry, sugar.
"
,,
1,7,"Help me.
"
,,
1,7,"Don't worry. I'll get you out of this.
"
,,
1,7,"I'll get us the best help there is.
"
,,
1,7,"""Dear MacGuyver...
"
,,
1,7,"""Enclosed is a rubber band, a paper clip,
"
,,
1,7,"and a drinking straw.
"
,,
1,7,"""Please save my dog.""
"
,,
1,7,"You're looking well.
"
,,
1,7,"Don't get too close.
"
,,
1,7,"They say I'm dangerous.
"
,,
1,7,"That's why the man's gonna put me down.
"
,,
1,7,"Don't say that, Brian.
"
,,
1,7,"Peter is working on your appeal.
"
,,
1,7,"You'll see. Everything's gonna work out.
"
,,
1,7,"I may have been born with my eyes closed,
"
,,
1,7,"but now I see the world for what it is.
"
,,
1,7,"I'm a second-class citizen, Lois.
"
,,
1,7,"Great news!
"
,,
1,7,"The City Council agreed to hear your case!
"
,,
1,7,"You're kidding! If I prepare
"
,,
1,7,"my case, I might have a chance after all.
"
,,
1,7,"I don't know how to thank you.
"
,,
1,7,"We're family.
"
,,
1,7,"This is what we do for each other.
"
,,
1,7,"Right, Peter?
"
,,
1,7,"Peter, don't stare!
"
,,
1,7,"Good luck, sweetness.
"
,,
1,7,"Thanks, Felicia.
"
,,
1,7,"This meeting was called...
"
,,
1,7,"...to review the judgment
"
,,
1,7,"in City of Quahog v. Brian Griffin.
"
,,
1,7,"Justice, for all? Or for some?
"
,,
1,7,"Does a dog not feel?
"
,,
1,7,"If you scratch him, does his leg not shake?
"
,,
1,7,"Yes, he is man's best friend.
"
,,
1,7,"But what manner of friend is man?
"
,,
1,7,"I would like to cite the case of
"
,,
1,7,"Plessy v. Ferguson...
"
,,
1,7,"Wait a minute.
"
,,
1,7,"Why are we listening to a dog?
"
,,
1,7,"Take him away!
"
,,
1,7,"Does not every dog have his day?
"
,,
1,7,"Wait! Please! I gotta say something!
"
,,
1,7,"Look, all Brian's ever wanted
"
,,
1,7,"is the same respect he gives us.
"
,,
1,7,"That and Snausages.
"
,,
1,7,"He's mental for those Snausages.
"
,,
1,7,"And sure, sometimes we have arguments,
"
,,
1,7,"like when he's sleeping on the bed and...
"
,,
1,7,"...Lois is in the ""oodmay""
"
,,
1,7,"but Brian won't ""amscray.""
"
,,
1,7," Peter...
"
,,
1,7," Okay.
"
,,
1,7,"Look. The point is, he's a member
"
,,
1,7,"of our family first and a dog second.
"
,,
1,7,"And I'm real sorry I forgot that, buddy.
"
,,
1,7,"Sometimes we all need a second chance.
"
,,
1,7,"Sometimes we all need to forgive!
"
,,
1,7,"I stole $10 from Meg's room!
"
,,
1,7,"I stole $10 from Mom's purse!
"
,,
1,7,"I've been making counterfeit $10 bills
"
,,
1,7,"for years.
"
,,
1,7,"Mr. Griffin, this dog is a danger to society.
"
,,
1,7,"Albeit an articulate and charismatic one.
"
,,
1,7,"But the law is the law and can't
"
,,
1,7,"be circumvented by pretty words.
"
,,
1,7,"I'll give you each $20.
"
,,
1,7,"Deal. He can go.
"
,,
1,7,"Mistrial, damn you! Mistrial!
"
,,
1,7,"No. Let him go.
"
,,
1,7,"Anybody want more pizza rolls?
"
,,
1,7,"Yeah. Quiet, Lois. Murder She Wrote.
"
,,
1,7,"Charles Montrose, after all these years.
"
,,
1,7,"Jessica Fletcher!
"
,,
1,7,"Why I haven't seen you since you had the...
"
,,
1,7,"You can say it, Charles.
"
,,
1,7,"I'm not ashamed. Abortion.
"
,,
1,7,"So she's the murderer!
"
,,
1,7,"Come on, kids. Bedtime.
"
,,
1,7,"Good night, Brian. And welcome home.
"
,,
1,7,"Good night, you guys.
"
,,
1,7,"Good night.
"
,,
1,7," Dog?
"
,,
1,7," Yeah?
"
,,
1,7,"If you ever tell anyone about that,
"
,,
1,7,"I will kill you.
"
,,
2,1,"""It seems today that all you see
"
,,
2,1,"""is violence in movies and sex on TV

2,1,"Mother, this hot dog has been
"
,,
2,1,"on my plate for a full minute...
"
,,
2,1,"...and it hasn't yet cut itself.
"

2,1,"Honey, I'll be right there.
"
,,
2,1,"By all means, take your time.
"
,,
2,1,"When you do finally get around to it,
"

2,1,"I'll be the one covered in flies...

2,1,"...with a belly that protrudes

2,1,"halfway to bloody Boston!
"

2,1,"Mom, there is no way I'm sleeping
"
,,
2,1,"in Chris' room this weekend!
"
,,
2,1,"It smells like old milk in there!
"
,,
2,1,"If I could find it, I'd clean it up!
"
,,
2,1,"Kids, keep it down.
"
,,
2,1,"I haven't even told your father
"
,,
2,1,"that Aunt Marguerite is coming to visit.
"
,,
2,1,"Who said Marguerite?
"
,,
2,1,"Peter, it's just for a week.
"
,,
2,1,"A week! No. Please, God, kill me now.
"
,,
2,1,"Damn, crap, damn it to hell, son of a...
"
,,
2,1,"Peter!
"
,,
2,1,"Lois, sometimes it's appropriate to swear.
"
,,
2,1,"Do you swear to tell the whole truth...
"
,,
2,1,"...and nothing but the truth,
"
,,
2,1,"so help you God?
"
,,
2,1,"I do. You bastard.
"
,,
2,1,"I love Aunt Marguerite.
"
,,
2,1,"Because if it wasn't for her,
"
,,
2,1,"I never would've met you, Peter.
"
,,
2,1,"Aunt Marguerite,
"
,,
2,1,"have you seen my towel?
"
,,
2,1,"Have the towel boy bring you another.
"
,,
2,1,"I don't want to bother him.
"
,,
2,1,"Nonsense, dear. You're a Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
2,1,"Towel boy!
"
,,
2,1,"Hi, my name is towel.
"
,,
2,1,"I have a Peter for you.
"
,,
2,1,"My name is Peter.
"
,,
2,1,"I'll be your nipples... Towel boy!
"
,,
2,1,"Oh, jeez.
"
,,
2,1,"Okay, everyone.
"
,,
2,1,"Give Aunt Marguerite
"
,,
2,1,"a big Griffin family welcome.
"
,,
2,1,"Aunt Marguerite!
"
,,
2,1,"Lois!
"
,,
2,1,"Oh, my God! She's dead!
"
,,
2,1,"Whoa!
"
,,
2,1,"Be careful what you wish for, huh, Lois?
"
,,
2,1,"What if they bury her and she
"
,,
2,1,"wakes up because she wasn't really dead...
"
,,
2,1,"...she was only sleeping?
"
,,
2,1,"Yeah. That's what happened
"
,,
2,1,"to our big brother Jimmy.
"
,,
2,1,"That's why Mom and Dad adopted you.
"
,,
2,1,"What?
"
,,
2,1,"Peter, you remember Coco,
"
,,
2,1,"my friend from Newport?
"
,,
2,1,"Peter, I almost didn't recognize you
"
,,
2,1,"without a towel on your arm.
"
,,
2,1,"Lois, where are your parents?
"
,,
2,1,"Don't tell me they're still on safari.
"
,,
2,1,"You know Daddy.
"
,,
2,1,"He won't rest until he kills something
"
,,
2,1,"on every continent.
"
,,
2,1,"But I'm hoping they'll be back
"
,,
2,1,"in time for Christmas.
"
,,
2,1,"It just wouldn't be Christmas
"
,,
2,1,"without your parents.
"
,,
2,1,"I dropped my watch.
"
,,
2,1,"Would you be a sport and fetch it for me?
"
,,
2,1,"Sure thing, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
2,1,"Peter, we've got to put that out!
"
,,
2,1,"I'm telling you, Brian, nothing changes.
"
,,
2,1,"These bluebeards still treat me like scum
"
,,
2,1,"'cause I'm not loaded.
"
,,
2,1,"I got news for them.
"
,,
2,1,"I'm as elegant as anyone in this room.
"
,,
2,1,"We have to meet
"
,,
2,1,"with Aunt Marguerite's lawyer tomorrow.
"
,,
2,1,"She left us something in her will.
"
,,
2,1,"Holy crap!
"
,,
2,1,"You sweet old broad, I love you!
"
,,
2,1,"Oh, my God. She's dead.
"
,,
2,1,"Madam Pewterschmidt's passing
"
,,
2,1,"has saddened us all.
"
,,
2,1,"Yeah, it's a real tragedy.
"
,,
2,1,"What did we get? Come on, big money!
"
,,
2,1,"No whammy! Stop!
"
,,
2,1,"Peter, please! I'm sorry.
"
,,
2,1,"He's stricken with grief.
"
,,
2,1,"Before she passed,
"
,,
2,1,"your aunt recorded a message for you.
"
,,
2,1,"Newport, Rhode Island...
"
,,
2,1,"...home of New England's
"
,,
2,1,"most elegant and historic estates...
"
,,
2,1,"...the Breakers, Rosecliff,
"
,,
2,1,"and exquisite Cherrywood Manor...
"
,,
2,1,"...the palatial mansion
"
,,
2,1,"of Marguerite Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
2,1,"Marguerite is a shining example of how
"
,,
2,1,"people with a lot of money...
"
,,
2,1,"...are just plain better than everyone else.
"
,,
2,1,"Lois, you were always
"
,,
2,1,"my favorite niece.
"
,,
2,1,"I just knew you'd find a wonderful man...
"
,,
2,1,"...who would make
"
,,
2,1,"all your dreams come true.
"
,,
2,1,"But I was wrong.
"
,,
2,1,"And now you're dead. Score one for Peter.
"
,,
2,1,"It's time you started living
"
,,
2,1,"like a Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
2,1,"That's why I'm giving you
"
,,
2,1,"my summer home in Newport.
"
,,
2,1,"Cherrywood?
"
,,
2,1,"That's so generous of Aunt Marguerite.
"
,,
2,1,"Our own summerhouse!
"
,,
2,1,"Now I feel bad for doing that thing
"
,,
2,1,"with her toothbrush.
"
,,
2,1,"""We only live to kiss your ass""
"
,,
2,1,"Kiss it? We'll even wipe it for you.
"
,,
2,1,"""From here on in, it's Easy Street""
"
,,
2,1," Any bars on that street?
"
,,
2,1," 24 happy hours a day.
"
,,
2,1,"Oh, boy.
"
,,
2,1,"""We'll stop Jehovahs at the gate""
"
,,
2,1,"Can I see that pamphlet, sir?
"
,,
2,1,"""My God, this house is freakin' sweet
"
,,
2,1,"""I make brunch, Clive cooks lunch
"
,,
2,1,"""each and every day

2,1,"""Hundred bucks, Blake is gay

2,1,"""We'll do the best we can with Meg""
"
,,
2,1,"Are you saying I'm ugly?
"
,,
2,1,"It doesn't matter, dear. You're rich now.
"
,,
2,1,"""We'll do your nails and rub your feet""
"
,,
2,1,"That's not necessary. Oh, my.
"
,,
2,1,"""We'll do your homework every night""
"
,,
2,1,"It's really hard.
"
,,
2,1,"That's why we got
"
,,
2,1,"that Steven Hawking guy.
"
,,
2,1,"""My God, this house is freakin' sweet
"
,,
2,1,"""I used to pass lots of gas

2,1,"What a coincidence. I've got one.

2,1,"Stewie!

,,
2,1,"""freakin' sweet""
"
,,
2,1,"Welcome!
"
,,
2,1,"That's a wrap, people.
"
,,
2,1,"Let's get the hell out of here.
"
,,
2,1,"Wait. Where are you going?
"
,,
2,1,"The old bag only paid us up
"
,,
2,1,"through the song.
"
,,
2,1,"We can just pick up after ourselves.
"
,,
2,1,"After all, we'll only be here on weekends.
"
,,
2,1,"No, Lois.
"
,,
2,1,"It's time you started living
"
,,
2,1,"like the Piece of Schmidt you are.
"
,,
2,1,"That's ""Pewterschmidt""!
"
,,
2,1,"Wait, you guys.
"
,,
2,1,"You're all hired to be
"
,,
2,1,"full-time Griffin servants.
"
,,
2,1,"Peter, where are we gonna get the money
"
,,
2,1,"to pay all these people?
"
,,
2,1,"Simple. I sold our house in Quahog.
"
,,
2,1,"You sold our home?
"
,,
2,1,"Surprise!
"
,,
2,1,"Peter, how could you?
"
,,
2,1,"Whoops.
"
,,
2,1,"""I recognize that tone
"
,,
2,1,"""Tonight I sleep alone
"
,,
2,1,"""But still, this house is freakin' sweet""
"
,,
2,1,"Peter, how could you sell our house
"
,,
2,1,"in Quahog without even asking me?
"
,,
2,1,"Honey, this is where you belong.
"
,,
2,1,"You deserve a big house and nice stuff.
"
,,
2,1,"Like diamonds.
"
,,
2,1,"But I love our old house.
"
,,
2,1,"You have to buy it back.
"
,,
2,1,"It's too late. Our stuff is packed.
"
,,
2,1,"It's on its way here.
"
,,
2,1,"Come on, Lois,
"
,,
2,1,"you'll love living in Newport.
"
,,
2,1,"Sure, this house is big,
"
,,
2,1,"but it's also very intimate.
"
,,
2,1,"Intimate.
"
,,
2,1,"So we're really gonna live here now?
"
,,
2,1,"That's right, honey.
"
,,
2,1,"I don't know, Peter.
"
,,
2,1,"Please, Mom. Look, there's a pool.
"
,,
2,1,"Yeah. And there's a chair.
"
,,
2,1,"The solarium is at the far end
"
,,
2,1,"of the west wing.
"
,,
2,1,"Come play with us, Stewie,
"
,,
2,1,"forever and ever and ever.
"
,,
2,1,"Yes. All work and no play
"
,,
2,1,"makes Stewie a dull boy.
"
,,
2,1,"Across the hall from the library
"
,,
2,1,"we have the billiard room.
"
,,
2,1,"And here we have the lounge.
"
,,
2,1,"Sweet Mary, mother of God! Jackpot!
"
,,
2,1,"What can I get you, sir?
"
,,
2,1,"We have 10 varieties of single malt scotch
"
,,
2,1,"and a wine cellar with over 10,000 bottles.
"
,,
2,1,"Don't make me beg.
"
,,
2,1,"I did love spending time here
"
,,
2,1,"when I was a kid.
"
,,
2,1,"All right, Mom!
"
,,
2,1,"Jonathan and I just returned
"
,,
2,1,"from sailing our yacht around the world.
"
,,
2,1,"Funny sailing story.
"
,,
2,1,"A guy's on his boat,
"
,,
2,1,"in the middle of the ocean...
"
,,
2,1,"...and he sees a little black dog.
"
,,
2,1,"This dog's been swimming for days,
"
,,
2,1,"and he stinks like a dead otter.
"
,,
2,1,"Peter, maybe this isn't the place...
"
,,
2,1,"Hang on, Lois.
"
,,
2,1,"So the guy takes the dog into the vet.
"
,,
2,1,"The freakin' vet tells him, get this,
"
,,
2,1,"""It's not a dog. It's a rat.""
"
,,
2,1,"A big, stinking Mexican rat. True story.
"
,,
2,1,"Dad, that's just an urban legend.
"
,,
2,1,"Hand to God.
"
,,
2,1,"I'm telling you, it was a huge freakin' rat.
"
,,
2,1,"Five times as big as that guy's steak.
"
,,
2,1,"Peter, that rat gets bigger
"
,,
2,1,"every time you tell this story.
"
,,
2,1,"I got a million of them.
"
,,
2,1,"Like the time my buddy's sister's boss
"
,,
2,1,"was drinking with a hooker in a Vegas bar.
"
,,
2,1,"Bam! Woke up without his kidney.
"
,,
2,1,"I can't believe they kicked me
"
,,
2,1,"out of the yacht club.
"
,,
2,1,"I barely had time
"
,,
2,1,"to stuff Lois' salmon in my jacket.
"
,,
2,1,"Face it, Peter. You have a knack
"
,,
2,1,"for saying the wrong thing.
"
,,
2,1,"This sucks.
"
,,
2,1,"Lois' friend ""yacht boy"" and
"
,,
2,1,"his lovely wife ""Caca"" invited us to some...
"
,,
2,1,"...hoity-toity auction tomorrow afternoon.
"
,,
2,1,"I don't want to embarrass her again.
"
,,
2,1,"You gotta help me.
"
,,
2,1,"Teach me how to be a gentleman.
"
,,
2,1,"Peter, it's not really that hard.
"
,,
2,1,"Let's start with polite conversation.
"
,,
2,1,"For example, ""It's a pleasure to see you
"
,,
2,1,"again. Lovely weather we're having.""
"
,,
2,1,"Now you try.
"
,,
2,1,"It's a pleasure to see you again.
"
,,
2,1,"After Hogan's Heroes,
"
,,
2,1,"Bob Crane got his skull crushed in...
"
,,
2,1,"...by a friend who videotaped him
"
,,
2,1,"having rough sex.
"
,,
2,1,"How's that?
"
,,
2,1,"Wow, perfect. My work is done.
"
,,
2,1,"But just for the heck of it, let's try again.
"
,,
2,1,"More coffee, madam?
"
,,
2,1,"I can get that, Sebastian.
"
,,
2,1,"To tell you the truth, we're all
"
,,
2,1,"a little uncomfortable being waited on.
"
,,
2,1,"Cut my egg!
"
,,
2,1,"Your eggs are cut, sir.
"
,,
2,1,"Cut my milk!
"
,,
2,1,"I can't, sir. It's liquid.
"
,,
2,1,"Imbecile! Freeze it, then cut it!
"
,,
2,1,"If you question me again,
"
,,
2,1,"I'll put you on diaper detail.
"
,,
2,1,"And I promise,
"
,,
2,1,"I won't make it easy for you!
"
,,
2,1,"Meg, you're gonna love Newport High.
"
,,
2,1,"It has a beautiful campus.
"
,,
2,1,"Filled with beautiful people.
"
,,
2,1,"And I'm gonna bag me a rich one.
"
,,
2,1,"Meg, that's a terrible thing to say.
"
,,
2,1,"You should marry someone you love.
"
,,
2,1,"That's what I did.
"
,,
2,1,"And he got us kicked out of the yacht club.
"
,,
2,1,"You can't be mad at your father
"
,,
2,1,"for being himself.
"
,,
2,1,"That's the reason I fell in love with him
"
,,
2,1,"in the first place.
"
,,
2,1,"He was so different from everyone else.
"
,,
2,1,"Coco,
"
,,
2,1,"the day I graduate from Harvard...
"
,,
2,1,"...l'm gonna carry you off into the sunset
"
,,
2,1,"on a white horse.
"
,,
2,1,"It better be a stretch horse
"
,,
2,1,"with leather seats and a chauffeur.
"
,,
2,1,"Isn't she a bit of terrific?
"
,,
2,1,"Kids, if you marry for love,
"
,,
2,1,"your life will be filled with its own riches.
"
,,
2,1,"Money doesn't buy happiness.
"
,,
2,1,"I beg to differ.
"
,,
2,1,"You!
"
,,
2,1,"Bring me The Wall Street Journal!
"
,,
2,1,"You two, fight to the death!
"
,,
2,1,"Okay, Peter, I was hoping I wouldn't
"
,,
2,1,"have to resort to shock therapy...
"
,,
2,1,"...but your progress has been...
"
,,
2,1,"Who are we kidding?
"
,,
2,1,"You haven't made any progress.
"
,,
2,1,"Now the left TV is tuned to Frasier.
"
,,
2,1,"The right TV has Ricki Lake.
"
,,
2,1,"If you so much as glance at the right TV,
"
,,
2,1,"I'm giving you 10,000 volts.
"
,,
2,1,"Got it.
"
,,
2,1,"You're so corpulent
"
,,
2,1,"that when you sit around...
"
,,
2,1,"...the magnificently appointed
"
,,
2,1,"Tuscan villa...
"
,,
2,1,"...you sit around the magnificently
"
,,
2,1,"appointed Tuscan villa.
"
,,
2,1,"This is the smartest show on TV.
"
,,
2,1,"Yo, Ricki. That's my girlfriend.
"
,,
2,1,"She ain't supposed to be having no penis!
"
,,
2,1,"Master Brian, do you really believe you can
"
,,
2,1,"pass him off as a gentleman at the auction?
"
,,
2,1,"We've got a long road ahead.
"
,,
2,1,"But I've worked miracles before.
"
,,
2,1,"And the Oscar goes to Marisa Tomei!
"
,,
2,1,"Peter was supposed to meet us here
"
,,
2,1,"an hour ago.
"
,,
2,1,"I hope he didn't change his mind.
"
,,
2,1,"Maybe he's already here.
"
,,
2,1,"Maybe he's fitting in so well, we can't
"
,,
2,1,"tell him from the other bluebloods.
"
,,
2,1,"I don't think we have to worry about that.
"
,,
2,1,"Lord Peter Lowenbrau Griffin the First.
"
,,
2,1,"Play me down the stairs, boys.
"
,,
2,1,"Good day.
"
,,
2,1,"Enchant.
"
,,
2,1,"Pasta Fazul.
"
,,
2,1,"Looking good, fellas.
"
,,
2,1,"Brian, do you know anything about this?
"
,,
2,1,"Lois, please. I'm just a dog. A stupid dog.
"
,,
2,1,"Vodka stinger with a whiskey back.
"
,,
2,1,"And step on it!
"
,,
2,1,"Peter, you're simply enchanting.
"
,,
2,1,"You must join us tomorrow
"
,,
2,1,"for a game of baccarat.
"
,,
2,1,"Right baccarat at you.
"
,,
2,1,"Brian, what happened to Peter?
"
,,
2,1,"He's not cramming hors d'oeuvres in his
"
,,
2,1,"mouth or asking anyone to pull his finger.
"
,,
2,1,"That's not the man I married.
"
,,
2,1,"So, I guess, technically,
"
,,
2,1,"that makes you available.
"
,,
2,1,"What?
"
,,
2,1,"Lighten up, toots. It's a party.
"
,,
2,1,"Barkeep,
"
,,
2,1,"it's like the damn Sahara over here!
"
,,
2,1,"How you doing, honey?
"
,,
2,1,"Welcome
"
,,
2,1,"to the Historical Society Auction.
"
,,
2,1,"Our first item is
"
,,
2,1,"a 17th-century gilded vessel.
"
,,
2,1,"We'll start the bidding at $140,000.
"
,,
2,1,"What a marvelous vessel.
"
,,
2,1,"It would look smashing in Lois's crapper.
"
,,
2,1,"I mean ""crapier"".
"
,,
2,1,"You are so right.
"
,,
2,1,"Any woman would love to have that vase
"
,,
2,1,"adorn her crapier.
"
,,
2,1,"Jonathan!
"
,,
2,1,"$140,000.
"
,,
2,1,"$150,000.
"
,,
2,1,"Brian, that sounded like Peter.
"
,,
2,1,"Come here, you!
"
,,
2,1,"$160,000.
"
,,
2,1,"$170,000.
"
,,
2,1," $180,000.
"
,,
2,1," $190,000.
"
,,
2,1,"$200,000.
"
,,
2,1,"We have a new record
"
,,
2,1,"for the Historical Society!
"
,,
2,1,"The vessel goes to...
"
,,
2,1,"$100 million!
"
,,
2,1,"To Mr. Peter Griffin
"
,,
2,1,"for an astonishing $100 million!
"
,,
2,1,"""Money, money, money""
"
,,
2,1,"Peter, we had no idea
"
,,
2,1,"you were such a philanthropist.
"
,,
2,1,"It's a fabulous vase, Peter, darling.
"
,,
2,1,"Do you collect objets d'art?
"
,,
2,1,"If that's French for ""Star Wars
"
,,
2,1,"collectors glasses,"" then si.
"
,,
2,1,"Mr. Griffin, you're the most generous man
"
,,
2,1,"since Ted Turner.
"
,,
2,1,"I'd like to announce I'm giving a gift
"
,,
2,1,"the whole world can appreciate.
"
,,
2,1,"I've colorized the moon.
"
,,
2,1,"Peter, you don't have $100 million!
"
,,
2,1,"Of course I do, my dear.
"
,,
2,1,"Now, would that be cash or check?
"
,,
2,1,"Drop by Cherrywood this evening.
"
,,
2,1,"I'll have the money wired to me
"
,,
2,1,"from my Swiss bank account.
"
,,
2,1,"Very good, sir.
"
,,
2,1,"You don't have a Swiss bank account!
"
,,
2,1,"Right.
"
,,
2,1,"My lawyer's advised me
"
,,
2,1,"to keep some of my assets a secret...
"
,,
2,1,"...in case things don't work out.
"
,,
2,1,"I'm going home. Where's Brian?
"
,,
2,1,"I told this blonde inside I got a 500SL.
"
,,
2,1,"Can you help me out?
"
,,
2,1,"I'm sorry. But I've made my decision.
"
,,
2,1,"We're moving back to Quahog
"
,,
2,1,"as soon as we can get packed.
"
,,
2,1,"Quahog, that one-horse town?
"
,,
2,1,"Shut up. No, you shut up.
"
,,
2,1,"No, you shut up. You're the one talking.
"
,,
2,1,"There's no one else here.
"
,,
2,1,"Everybody just shut up!
"
,,
2,1,"What's that? The wind!
"
,,
2,1,"A pox on Quahog!
"
,,
2,1,"Easy!
"
,,
2,1,"If I ever go back to Quahog, it'll be just
"
,,
2,1,"so I can poke poor people with a stick!
"
,,
2,1,"Bon Jovi, everyone.
"
,,
2,1,"Now I remember why I left Newport!
"
,,
2,1,"It changes people.
"
,,
2,1,"You kids have lost your values.
"
,,
2,1,"You've lost your mind! And I don't
"
,,
2,1,"much care for Stewie's new friends.
"
,,
2,1,"The Pacific Rim economy
"
,,
2,1,"is still a tad shaky for my taste.
"
,,
2,1,"Stop it!
"
,,
2,1,"You can't become a bloody
"
,,
2,1,"fiscal hermit crab...
"
,,
2,1,"...every time the Nikkei undergoes
"
,,
2,1,"a correction!
"
,,
2,1,"Asia's market has nowhere to go but up!
"
,,
2,1,"Interesting.
"
,,
2,1,"Indeed.
"
,,
2,1,"I wish we'd never come here
"
,,
2,1,"in the first place.
"
,,
2,1,"Go buy yourself some more money.
"
,,
2,1,"Hey, old bean.
"
,,
2,1,"What are you doing
"
,,
2,1,"with my Star Wars glass?
"
,,
2,1,"Illustrating a point.
"
,,
2,1,"Peter, when Han Solo took
"
,,
2,1,"the Millennium Falcon to Cloud City...
"
,,
2,1,"...he saw that Lando Calrissian...
"
,,
2,1,"...had turned control of the station
"
,,
2,1,"over to Darth Vader.
"
,,
2,1,"Lando had forgotten who he was.
"
,,
2,1,"It was only after Han was
"
,,
2,1,"encased in carbonite...
"
,,
2,1,"...and taken by Boba Fett
"
,,
2,1,"to Jabba's palace...
"
,,
2,1,"...that he was able
"
,,
2,1,"to see the error of his ways.
"
,,
2,1,"Look inside yourself.
"
,,
2,1,"You're not a Newport millionaire.
"
,,
2,1,"I created you.
"
,,
2,1,"In a way, I am your father.
"
,,
2,1,"That's not true! That's impossible.
"
,,
2,1,"Damn it, Peter! Snap out of it!
"
,,
2,1,"No!
"
,,
2,1,"I just had the craziest dream
"
,,
2,1,"where I bought a $100 million vase.
"
,,
2,1,"A Mr. Brandywine from
"
,,
2,1,"the Historical Society is at the front gate.
"
,,
2,1,"He'll be here in half an hour.
"
,,
2,1,"That wasn't a dream.
"
,,
2,1,"He's here for the money.
"
,,
2,1,"Brian, I'm screwed.
"
,,
2,1,"If I welsh on that debt,
"
,,
2,1,"I'm gonna prove to everyone...
"
,,
2,1,"...that I'm not good enough for Lois.
"
,,
2,1,"If I only had something
"
,,
2,1,"worth that much money.
"
,,
2,1,"I never should've dropped
"
,,
2,1,"Joe Green's jersey.
"
,,
2,1,"Good game, Mean Joe.
"
,,
2,1,"You want some of my Coke?
"
,,
2,1,"Hey, kid. Catch.
"
,,
2,1,"Wow. Thanks, Mean Joe.
"
,,
2,1,"What about this house?
"
,,
2,1,"I could give him the house and call it even.
"
,,
2,1,"Cherrywood isn't worth $100 million.
"
,,
2,1,"Brian, it's the Historical Society.
"
,,
2,1,"We just gotta convince him that...
"
,,
2,1,"...$100 million worth of history
"
,,
2,1,"happened here.
"
,,
2,1,"So you're saying that Jesus carved
"
,,
2,1,"his name into this mantle...
"
,,
2,1,"...51 years before he was born.
"
,,
2,1,"Yeah. He's Jesus. He can do anything.
"
,,
2,1,"And look over here.
"
,,
2,1,"That's where the market crashed.
"
,,
2,1,"Mr. Griffin!
"
,,
2,1,"You can't take a step in this house
"
,,
2,1,"without uncovering something historical.
"
,,
2,1,"Wait a second.
"
,,
2,1,"Could that be Harriet Tubman's
"
,,
2,1,"secret underground railroad?
"
,,
2,1,"It is! Go, Freedom Train!
"
,,
2,1,"I've seen enough.
"
,,
2,1,"I happen to know that nothing of
"
,,
2,1,"historical significance ever occurred here.
"
,,
2,1,"Please, have our money ready
"
,,
2,1,"by tomorrow. Good day!
"
,,
2,1,"Wait!
"
,,
2,1,"Look, this is where the Pilgrims
"
,,
2,1,"landed at Fraggle Rock!
"
,,
2,1,"Excuse me, Lord Griffin.
"
,,
2,1,"Your family is going back to Quahog.
"
,,
2,1,"If you get tired of being a snob, look us up.
"
,,
2,1,"Lord Griffin is dead.
"
,,
2,1,"It's just me, Peter the towel boy.
"
,,
2,1,"Peter, you're back! Let's go home!
"
,,
2,1,"We can't. I sold our home.
"
,,
2,1,"Our beautiful home with the stolen cable...
"
,,
2,1,"...and the man with the penis
"
,,
2,1,"for a light switch.
"
,,
2,1,"We'll find another place.
"
,,
2,1,"Your Aunt Marguerite is laughing
"
,,
2,1,"at me while she's burning in Hell...
"
,,
2,1,"...may she rest in peace.
"
,,
2,1,"She was right. Everyone was right.
"
,,
2,1,"I'm not good enough for you.
"
,,
2,1,"Peter, I don't care what anyone else thinks.
"
,,
2,1,"All that matters is that I love you.
"
,,
2,1,"I love you, too, Lois.
"
,,
2,1,"Lois, our problems are over!
"
,,
2,1,"Our mansion is historical, all right.
"
,,
2,1,"Cherrywood was America's
"
,,
2,1,"first presidential whorehouse!
"
,,
2,1,"See, there's Lincoln, Grant, Robert E. Lee.
"
,,
2,1,"Those are fake!
"
,,
2,1,"They're real.
"
,,
2,1,"And, FYI, Lincoln had the jungle fever.
"
,,
2,1,"So you see,
"
,,
2,1,"Chubby Franklin lived across the street.
"
,,
2,1,"Chubby Franklin would always
"
,,
2,1,"make a face like this.
"
,,
2,1,"Dad, you're not listening.
"
,,
2,1,"I have a serious problem.
"
,,
2,1,"I got a girl pregnant. What do I do?
"
,,
2,1,"And when we saw Chubby Franklin
"
,,
2,1,"make his face, we would all make this face.
"
,,
2,1,"Oh, God!
"
,,
2,1,"Dad, you never did tell us
"
,,
2,1,"how you got our house back.
"
,,
2,1,"Simple. I just offered the people
"
,,
2,1,"I sold it to double what they paid.
"
,,
2,1,"What? But how could you afford that?
"
,,
2,1,"I kept one of those Lincoln pictures
"
,,
2,1,"and held a little auction of my own.
"
,,
2,1,"Thanks to old Honest Abe we have our
"
,,
2,1,"house back and I learned a valuable lesson.
"
,,
2,1,"It doesn't matter if your family
"
,,
2,1,"doesn't think I'm good enough for you.
"
,,
2,1,"That's right, because all that's important
"
,,
2,1,"is that I love you.
"
,,
2,1,"No, because your ancestors were nothing
"
,,
2,1,"but a bunch of pimps and whores.
"
,,
2,2,"""It seems today that all you see
"
,,
2,2,"""is violence in movies and sex on TV
"
,,
2,2,"""But where are those good,

,,
2,2,"old-fashioned values

2,2,"I'm afraid you only have six months to live.
"
,,
2,2,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
2,2,"Got milk?
"
,,
2,2,"Listen up, everybody.
"
,,
2,2,"Your Grandpa Griffin is finally retiring.
"
,,
2,2,"Grandpa Griffin?
"
,,
2,2,"Is he the one that smells like firewood
"
,,
2,2,"and has big gray pussywillows in his ears?
"
,,
2,2,"Chris, that's a terrible word.
"
,,
2,2,"""Pussywillows.""
"
,,
2,2,"My dad worked at that mill for 60 years.
"
,,
2,2,"That's almost 80 years.
"
,,
2,2,"Tomorrow we'll all go
"
,,
2,2,"to a big dinner to honor him.
"
,,
2,2,"Why? We barely know him.
"
,,
2,2,"Yeah. How come he never visits us?
"
,,
2,2,"Kids, your grandfather has never been
"
,,
2,2,"comfortable with the fact...
"
,,
2,2,"...that I'm not Catholic.
"
,,
2,2,"Dad loves all of us.
"
,,
2,2,"He's just too busy working to show it.
"
,,
2,2,"He's been that way since I was a kid.
"
,,
2,2,"And now the winners of
"
,,
2,2,"the father-son three-legged race.
"
,,
2,2,"First place, Bobby Hammill and his dad.
"
,,
2,2,"Second place, Jimmy Lawson and his dad.
"
,,
2,2,"Third place,
"
,,
2,2,"Peter Griffin and a stalk of corn.
"
,,
2,2,"Now that he's retiring,
"
,,
2,2,"we can finally spend some time together.
"
,,
2,2,"I want us to have one of those
"
,,
2,2,"father-son moments, like on TV.
"
,,
2,2,"Where we hug and the music goes...
"
,,
2,2,"Thanks, boys. Just like that.
"
,,
2,2,"Can you do that fluttery thing like
"
,,
2,2,"when the Brady kids run down the stairs?
"
,,
2,2,"I don't want to tattle.
"
,,
2,2,"But is Bobby really a doctor?
"
,,
2,2,"Mom, I can't eat.
"
,,
2,2,"I'm too grossed out by Grandpa's ears.
"
,,
2,2,"I know.
"
,,
2,2,"They're like a big, gray enchanted forest.
"
,,
2,2,"Kids, your grandfather's ears are not gross.
"
,,
2,2,"And they are certainly not
"
,,
2,2,"an enchanted forest.
"
,,
2,2,"But seriously, tonight
"
,,
2,2,"we here at Pawtucket Mill celebrate...
"
,,
2,2,"...the career of our oldest and
"
,,
2,2,"most dedicated employee, Francis Griffin.
"
,,
2,2,"Francis.
"
,,
2,2,"At mass this morning...
"
,,
2,2,"...it occurred to me that I may never see
"
,,
2,2,"any of your faces again.
"
,,
2,2,"I just want to say that Jesus loves you.
"
,,
2,2,"But in my eyes,
"
,,
2,2,"you're a bunch of sinners and slackers...
"
,,
2,2,"...who forced a hard-working
"
,,
2,2,"old man to retire.
"
,,
2,2,"So you can take this shiny watch
"
,,
2,2,"and shove it.
"
,,
2,2,"I adore this man!
"
,,
2,2,"That was some speech, Dad.
"
,,
2,2,"Yeah. It's a shame Grandma
"
,,
2,2,"wasn't there to hear it.
"
,,
2,2,"Bless her heart. She's on another one
"
,,
2,2,"of her prayer missions in Las Vegas.
"
,,
2,2,"Hit me, you five-card stud.
"
,,
2,2,"Cocktail!
"
,,
2,2,"Aye, she's a rose.
"
,,
2,2,"It's a pity you couldn't find yourself
"
,,
2,2,"a nice Irish Catholic girl, Peter.
"
,,
2,2,"Francis, this must be embarrassing for you.
"
,,
2,2,"I'm in the car.
"
,,
2,2,"Now that you're retired, you're
"
,,
2,2,"coming to stay with us.
"
,,
2,2,"No more excuses.
"
,,
2,2,"I'm putting my foot down.
"
,,
2,2,"Brian, buckle up. What do you say, Dad?
"
,,
2,2," I don't want to be a bother.
"
,,
2,2," It's no bother, is it, Lois?
"
,,
2,2,"Of course not. It'll be fun.
"
,,
2,2,"You're a good woman, Lois.
"
,,
2,2,"Perhaps you won't burn in Hell after all.
"
,,
2,2,"Maybe you'll just go to purgatory
"
,,
2,2,"with all the unbaptized babies.
"
,,
2,2,"There you go, Lois. You love kids.
"
,,
2,2,"Look at that.
"
,,
2,2,"Dad's reading Stewie to sleep,
"
,,
2,2,"just like he never did for me.
"
,,
2,2,"""So God cast the pagans and sinners
"
,,
2,2,"into the fiery bowels of Hell...
"
,,
2,2,"""...where their flesh burned in agony
"
,,
2,2,"forever and ever.""
"
,,
2,2,"The end.
"
,,
2,2,"Children love a good bedtime story
"
,,
2,2,"from the Bible.
"
,,
2,2,"Yes, charming.
"
,,
2,2,"Like when God told Abraham to kill Isaac.
"
,,
2,2,"Hey!
"
,,
2,2,"That was a lovely service, Francis.
"
,,
2,2,"Super. And only
"
,,
2,2,"three more hours till school.
"
,,
2,2,"I didn't even know there was
"
,,
2,2,"a 5:00 a.m. Mass.
"
,,
2,2,"I didn't even know there was a 5:00 a.m.
"
,,
2,2,"What else haven't you told me?
"
,,
2,2,"I rather like this God fellow.
"
,,
2,2,"He's very theatrical, you know.
"
,,
2,2,"A pestilence here and a plague there.
"
,,
2,2,"Omnipotence!
"
,,
2,2,"Got to get me some of that.
"
,,
2,2,"Yes. We all enjoy the Bible in this house.
"
,,
2,2,"Really? What's your favorite book
"
,,
2,2,"of the Bible?
"
,,
2,2,"That one where Jesus swallows
"
,,
2,2,"the puzzle piece...
"
,,
2,2,"...and the man in the big yellow hat
"
,,
2,2,"has to take him to the hospital.
"
,,
2,2,"Open this door! Open it, I say!
"
,,
2,2,"Sorry, Grandpa.
"
,,
2,2,"You might want to give that
"
,,
2,2,"a minute or two.
"
,,
2,2,"I know what you're doing in there,
"
,,
2,2,"and it's a sin!
"
,,
2,2,"If you ever do it again, you'll burn in Hell!
"
,,
2,2,"But I do it every day. Sometimes twice.
"
,,
2,2,"Mark my words, lad.
"
,,
2,2,"You may think you're alone,
"
,,
2,2,"but God's watching.
"
,,
2,2,"Don't do it again!
"
,,
2,2,"God's watching me do number two?
"
,,
2,2,"I'm a sinner, and God's a pervert.
"
,,
2,2,"Megan!
"
,,
2,2,"How was school?
"
,,
2,2,"Good. Kevin walked me home.
"
,,
2,2," Kevin?
"
,,
2,2," He lives next door.
"
,,
2,2,"He lives next door to a harlot!
"
,,
2,2,"Grandpa, we were just holding hands.
"
,,
2,2,"It'll be easy for him to take your hand
"
,,
2,2,"when God strikes your heart with leprosy.
"
,,
2,2,"He can take it right home with him!
"
,,
2,2,"Lord, it's great to see you kids.
"
,,
2,2,"Francis, we were watching that.
"
,,
2,2,"I'll tell you how it ends.
"
,,
2,2,"Laura burns the roast...
"
,,
2,2,"...and God kills her for parading her bum
"
,,
2,2,"around in those pants!
"
,,
2,2,"Yeah, not a bad way to kick off
"
,,
2,2,"your retirement, huh, Dad?
"
,,
2,2,"Yeah, the magic of baseball has brought
"
,,
2,2,"fathers and sons together...
"
,,
2,2,"...for millions of years.
"
,,
2,2,"Stewie's having fun.
"
,,
2,2,"Why does that man drop his club
"
,,
2,2,"before he runs around?
"
,,
2,2,"I would bring it with me.
"
,,
2,2,"Hey, who wants a Fenway frank?
"
,,
2,2,"Nothing says, ""Please talk to me, Daddy,""
"
,,
2,2,"like a Fenway frank.
"
,,
2,2,"Is there a bathroom here?
"
,,
2,2,"I don't think I can wait anymore.
"
,,
2,2,"In a public restroom, lad?
"
,,
2,2,"For the good of your soul,
"
,,
2,2,"show some restraint.
"
,,
2,2,"Hey, hot dog guy!
"
,,
2,2,"I'll get him.
"
,,
2,2,"Oh, no, Dad, they bring them to you.
"
,,
2,2,"Well, la-de-da.
"
,,
2,2,"I don't need my food brought to me.
"
,,
2,2,"I'm not a broken-down old mule!
"
,,
2,2,"I can still work!
"
,,
2,2,"I can still take orders!
"
,,
2,2,"Oh, hey! Hey, look! Hey, Dad!
"
,,
2,2,"Aw, crap. That was money well-spent.
"
,,
2,2,"He just left without saying anything?
"
,,
2,2,"Where would he go?
"
,,
2,2,"I don't know. I asked him to buy me
"
,,
2,2,"some peanuts and cracker jacks.
"
,,
2,2,"I don't care if he ever gets back.
"
,,
2,2,"I wasn't being cute. I really hope he's dead.
"
,,
2,2,"Tom, the city of Boston
"
,,
2,2,"is examining its conscience tonight...
"
,,
2,2,"...in preparation for a visit from the Pope.
"
,,
2,2,"That's right, Diane. I'll tell you what else
"
,,
2,2,"will be examined, this cock.
"
,,
2,2,"The Rhode Island Cock Society
"
,,
2,2,"is sponsoring free check-ups...
"
,,
2,2,"...for this year's Cock Awareness Week.
"
,,
2,2,"I don't know why the suggestive name.
"
,,
2,2,"They could've just as easily
"
,,
2,2,"gone with ""rooster.""
"
,,
2,2,"I'm telling you.
"
,,
2,2,"Something must've happened to him.
"
,,
2,2,"He's probably hurt, or lost,
"
,,
2,2,"or shanghaied by pirates!
"
,,
2,2,"That renegade pirate ship captained
"
,,
2,2,"by the ruthless Peg Leg Swantoon!
"
,,
2,2,"Peter, calm down.
"
,,
2,2,"It's his first night of retirement.
"
,,
2,2,"He's probably out enjoying himself.
"
,,
2,2,"He's in jail.
"
,,
2,2,"Dad, my God, are you okay?
"
,,
2,2,"Don't be using the Lord's name in vain!
"
,,
2,2,"He's okay! Thank God!
"
,,
2,2,"It seems he broke into the old mill
"
,,
2,2,"after hours.
"
,,
2,2,"We found him working on a kick press.
"
,,
2,2,"Dad, you left the ball game with me
"
,,
2,2,"to go work in a mill?
"
,,
2,2,"Yes! I want to work! I want my job back!
"
,,
2,2,"But, Dad, you're retired.
"
,,
2,2,"I'd rather be dead.
"
,,
2,2,"I'll tell you what's dead. Vaudeville.
"
,,
2,2,"You know what killed it? Talkie pictures.
"
,,
2,2,"But you can still make it.
"
,,
2,2,"You just need a gimmick.
"
,,
2,2,"I, for one, am a tumbler.
"
,,
2,2,"Here, watch my round-off.
"
,,
2,2,"Hey, be a sport. Take the pills out of
"
,,
2,2,"my pocket and put one under my tongue.
"
,,
2,2,"I don't get it, Lois. Baseball's always
"
,,
2,2,"been the secret to male bonding.
"
,,
2,2,"It even worked for Rosie O'Donnell
"
,,
2,2,"and his father in A League of Their Own.
"
,,
2,2,"I hate to say this...
"
,,
2,2,"...but it doesn't seem like your dad
"
,,
2,2,"is interested in bonding with you.
"
,,
2,2,"All he cares about is work.
"
,,
2,2,"Wait a second. Work!
"
,,
2,2,"That's what'll bring us together.
"
,,
2,2,"We can start our own father-son business.
"
,,
2,2,"What are you doing with all them
"
,,
2,2,"bathtubs, you heathen dummy?
"
,,
2,2,"Pop, why you gotta be like that?
"
,,
2,2,"We cut 'em in half, stick a Virgin Mary
"
,,
2,2,"in them and sell them as shrines.
"
,,
2,2,"That's my boy. At least,
"
,,
2,2,"that's what your mama always told me.
"
,,
2,2,"Now give me a hug before I give you
"
,,
2,2,"a knuckle sandwich.
"
,,
2,2,"Or you could just get your father a job
"
,,
2,2,"with you at the toy factory.
"
,,
2,2,"That's an even better idea!
"
,,
2,2,"Lois, you're a genius.
"
,,
2,2,"Now give me a hug
"
,,
2,2,"before I give you a knuckle sandwich.
"
,,
2,2,"Peter, I can't hug you.
"
,,
2,2,"Cut it out. I'm serious.
"
,,
2,2,"And this is the nerve center
"
,,
2,2,"of the whole factory, my station.
"
,,
2,2,"I assemble our new action figure,
"
,,
2,2,"Zeke, the moody drifter.
"
,,
2,2,"You mean to tell me
"
,,
2,2,"you stand here all day playing with dolls?
"
,,
2,2,"It's not easy.
"
,,
2,2,"See, I gotta twist on his head...
"
,,
2,2,"...and stick a tiny pack of smokes
"
,,
2,2,"in his torn denim jacket.
"
,,
2,2,"Any of you kids want to see a dead body?
"
,,
2,2,"Wait here, Dad.
"
,,
2,2,"Hey, Mr. Weed?
"
,,
2,2,"Peter.
"
,,
2,2,"Listen, I was wondering if you might
"
,,
2,2,"have a job for my dad.
"
,,
2,2,"Your father?
"
,,
2,2,"He must be a man of at least 70.
"
,,
2,2,"Oh, yeah. But he's in great shape.
"
,,
2,2,"Except his prostate.
"
,,
2,2,"At 2:00 a.m. Last night, I thought
"
,,
2,2,"a horse was using the bathroom.
"
,,
2,2,"All finished. What's next?
"
,,
2,2,"You did my whole day's work
"
,,
2,2,"in five minutes.
"
,,
2,2,"We should sell you to the circus, you freak!
"
,,
2,2,"I've never seen such productivity.
"
,,
2,2,"How is this possible?
"
,,
2,2,"I'll tell you how it's possible.
"
,,
2,2,"Because this man always put his job
"
,,
2,2,"before everything else.
"
,,
2,2,"His wife, his health, even his own son.
"
,,
2,2,"Especially his own son.
"
,,
2,2,"I need hear no more.
"
,,
2,2,"Everyone, this is your new shop foreman.
"
,,
2,2,"Welcome aboard, sir. Lead as you see fit.
"
,,
2,2,"Dad, after all these years, you and me
"
,,
2,2,"together, side by side, father and son.
"
,,
2,2,"Peter, this is truly a miracle.
"
,,
2,2,"I'm so grateful.
"
,,
2,2,"Hold that thought. Hey, boys, you're on.
"
,,
2,2,"Go ahead, Dad.
"
,,
2,2,"Thank you, Jesus.
"
,,
2,2,"I have a purpose in life again.
"
,,
2,2,"Hey! Break up the sewing circle
"
,,
2,2,"and get back to work!
"
,,
2,2,"My, my. What a thumping good read!
"
,,
2,2,"Lions eating Christians,
"
,,
2,2,"people nailing each other to two-by-fours.
"
,,
2,2,"I say, you won't find that
"
,,
2,2,"in Winnie the Pooh.
"
,,
2,2,"Please don't say ""pooh.""
"
,,
2,2,"Are you all right? Where's your father?
"
,,
2,2,"Still at the factory.
"
,,
2,2,"He's turning the break room into a chapel.
"
,,
2,2,"A chapel? Where will you all eat lunch?
"
,,
2,2,"Lois, lunch is a sin. Taking a break is a sin.
"
,,
2,2,"Bestiality is a sin.
"
,,
2,2,"I'm not sure how that came up exactly,
"
,,
2,2,"but me and Dad have never been closer.
"
,,
2,2,"Having him at the factory is the best...
"
,,
2,2,"I got it.
"
,,
2,2,"Your dad stinks.
"
,,
2,2,"I'm working triple shifts,
"
,,
2,2,"and I'm still not Employee of the Week.
"
,,
2,2,"How am I supposed to compete with that?
"
,,
2,2,"Where is he anyway?
"
,,
2,2,"This'll be for my fourth birdie.
"
,,
2,2,"Looks like someone's in the zone.
"
,,
2,2,"Tough break there, Jesus.
"
,,
2,2,"Yup. Or was it?
"
,,
2,2,"Boo-yah!
"
,,
2,2,"Back to work, all of you!
"
,,
2,2,"What's going on here?
"
,,
2,2,"Dad, some of the guys think that...
"
,,
2,2,"...since you took over, work is no fun.
"
,,
2,2," Work's not supposed to be fun.
"
,,
2,2," Why not?
"
,,
2,2,"Why not?
"
,,
2,2,"That's Satan talking! You're a failure
"
,,
2,2,"as a worker and as a father!
"
,,
2,2,"Now wait a minute. I may not be perfect.
"
,,
2,2,"At least I love my kids enough not to
"
,,
2,2,"spend every minute of the day working!
"
,,
2,2,"I'm a damn good father,
"
,,
2,2,"and that's more than I can say about you!
"
,,
2,2,"Peter, you've never spoken to me
"
,,
2,2,"like that before.
"
,,
2,2,"You're fired!
"
,,
2,2,"Well, in that case,
"
,,
2,2,"I'm suing you for sexual harassment.
"
,,
2,2,"I'll see you at home.
"
,,
2,2,"What are you doing, lad?
"
,,
2,2,"Nothing!
"
,,
2,2,"Something's wrong with
"
,,
2,2,"your shower. The water's not cold enough.
"
,,
2,2,"I like me showers colder
"
,,
2,2,"than a well digger's kerblocken.
"
,,
2,2,"I think it's time someone sits
"
,,
2,2,"his kerfluffin' down...
"
,,
2,2,"...and has a talk with his unemployed son.
"
,,
2,2,"If he needs to talk...
"
,,
2,2,"...he'd best go to confession
"
,,
2,2,"to beg forgiveness for all his failings!
"
,,
2,2,"Have a glorious day.
"
,,
2,2,"How can you just sit there
"
,,
2,2,"and let him talk like that?
"
,,
2,2,"He's right, Lois. I am no good.
"
,,
2,2,"Even my own dad doesn't love me.
"
,,
2,2,"Face it. I'm going to Hell.
"
,,
2,2,"Adolf Hitler, Al Capone,
"
,,
2,2,"John Wilkes Booth.
"
,,
2,2,"Hey, what are you doing here?
"
,,
2,2,"I killed a hooker. She made a crack about
"
,,
2,2,"me being faster than a speeding bullet...
"
,,
2,2,"...so I ripped her in half like a phone book.
"
,,
2,2,"Yes, the fat man's going to Hell.
"
,,
2,2,"And from the looks of his midsection,
"
,,
2,2,"he'll burn like a tire dump for all eternity.
"
,,
2,2,"Oh! I love God!
"
,,
2,2,"He's so deliciously evil.
"
,,
2,2,"Stewie, eat your oatmeal.
"
,,
2,2,"Honey, you're a wonderful husband...
"
,,
2,2,"...a loving father, and,
"
,,
2,2,"for some reason I'll never understand...
"
,,
2,2,"...a very devoted son.
"
,,
2,2,"That's a nice thought, Lois, but sadly,
"
,,
2,2,"it means nothing coming from you.
"
,,
2,2,"The moment has arrived at last.
"
,,
2,2,"We now go live
"
,,
2,2,"to Logan International Airport...
"
,,
2,2,"...where the Pope's plane
"
,,
2,2,"has just touched down.
"
,,
2,2,"Hello, Boston!
"
,,
2,2,"Are you ready to humble...
"
,,
2,2,"...yourself before God?
"
,,
2,2,"What? Have you all taken a vow of silence?
"
,,
2,2,"Come on!
"
,,
2,2,"Then put your hands together for the one,
"
,,
2,2,"the only...
"
,,
2,2,"...His Holiness, the Pope!
"
,,
2,2,"Hey, I just got a crazy idea!
"
,,
2,2,"Why? Why?
"
,,
2,2,"Hey, I just got another crazy idea!
"
,,
2,2,"Hey, did you ever notice this?
"
,,
2,2,"On page 375, it says ""Jebus.""
"
,,
2,2,"It's supposed to be ""Jesus,"" right?
"
,,
2,2," Room service!
"
,,
2,2," We didn't order no room service.
"
,,
2,2,"Actually I just wanted
"
,,
2,2,"to check the honor bar.
"
,,
2,2,"The last Pope we had here
"
,,
2,2,"filled his shaving kit with Necco wafers.
"
,,
2,2,"All right, wise guy, who are you?
"
,,
2,2,"I'm just a faithful Catholic man...
"
,,
2,2,"...with a family crisis
"
,,
2,2,"only His Holiness can resolve.
"
,,
2,2,"I've never asked the church for anything,
"
,,
2,2,"but I don't know where else to turn.
"
,,
2,2,"Dust him!
"
,,
2,2,"My heavens, son! Are you okay?
"
,,
2,2,"Yeah. I just got bounced
"
,,
2,2,"by the Pope's road crew.
"
,,
2,2,"It's good you missed me.
"
,,
2,2,"I'm to drive the Popemobile.
"
,,
2,2,"Any slight bump on the head
"
,,
2,2,"knocks me unconscious for a few hours.
"
,,
2,2,"I always wake up fine,
"
,,
2,2,"but it's just so darn inconvenient...
"
,,
2,2,"...to be knocked out that easily.
"
,,
2,2,"Even by the slightest tap. Like this.
"
,,
2,2,"Taking it off here, Boss.
"
,,
2,2," Take it off there, Luke.
"
,,
2,2," Wiping it off, Boss.
"
,,
2,2," Wipe it off, Nine.
"
,,
2,2," Waving at the Pope here, Boss.
"
,,
2,2,"Wave at the Pope there, Luke.
"
,,
2,2,"Are you sure this is Boston?
"
,,
2,2,"Yeah, it's Boston.
"
,,
2,2,"See, look, there's Harvard.
"
,,
2,2,"That's just a barn.
"
,,
2,2,"Someone went to Yale.
"
,,
2,2,"Lois, put the coffee on.
"
,,
2,2,"Careful. I just cleaned the floor.
"
,,
2,2,"Good thing.
"
,,
2,2,"Lemony.
"
,,
2,2,"Your Holiness, this is such an honor.
"
,,
2,2,"Please, go into the living room
"
,,
2,2,"and make yourself at home!
"
,,
2,2,"What is the Pope doing here?
"
,,
2,2,"Relax. I just hijacked his bubble car
"
,,
2,2,"so he can convince my dad I'm a good guy.
"
,,
2,2,"You kidnapped the Pope?
"
,,
2,2,"This is the most reckless thing
"
,,
2,2,"you've ever done!
"
,,
2,2,"Come on. What about the time
"
,,
2,2,"I was on that airplane?
"
,,
2,2,"Peter, you've raised a fine family.
"
,,
2,2,"Well, my dad thinks I'm a screw-up.
"
,,
2,2,"I was hoping you could change his mind.
"
,,
2,2,"He'd have to believe you.
"
,,
2,2,"You're God's go-to guy.
"
,,
2,2,"Your father is entitled to his opinion.
"
,,
2,2,"But more important is what you think.
"
,,
2,2,"Look deep in your heart, my son.
"
,,
2,2,"Do you think you're a screw-up?
"
,,
2,2,"No. I'm not. You know what?
"
,,
2,2,"I'm a damn good father.
"
,,
2,2,"I have great kids.
"
,,
2,2,"That's not what Grandpa says.
"
,,
2,2,"Grandpa is wrong.
"
,,
2,2,"Meg, it's not a sin
"
,,
2,2,"for a girl your age to like boys.
"
,,
2,2,"Thanks, Daddy.
"
,,
2,2,"And Chris, what you do in the bathroom
"
,,
2,2,"is between you and God.
"
,,
2,2,"And if you're sorry, he'll forgive you.
"
,,
2,2,"Thanks, Dad!
"
,,
2,2,"Good for you, Peter.
"
,,
2,2,"But isn't there someone else
"
,,
2,2,"you should speak to?
"
,,
2,2,"Yes, there is.
"
,,
2,2,"Scarecrow, you've had brains all along.
"
,,
2,2,"Same goes for your heart, Tin Man.
"
,,
2,2,"And Kristy McNichol,
"
,,
2,2,"come back to television. We miss you.
"
,,
2,2,"I meant you should talk to your father.
"
,,
2,2,"You're right. You with me, big guy?
"
,,
2,2,"Peter, I go where I am needed.
"
,,
2,2,"To the Popemobile!
"
,,
2,2,"Remember when we brought
"
,,
2,2,"in that stripper for Lombardi's birthday...
"
,,
2,2,"...and it turned out to be his son?
"
,,
2,2,"I think this is gonna top it.
"
,,
2,2,"Wow, it's the Pope!
"
,,
2,2,"Slothful sinners! You're here
"
,,
2,2,"to work, not sit around with your...
"
,,
2,2,"Holy Mother! It's the Holy Father.
"
,,
2,2,"I am not worthy.
"
,,
2,2,"Rise, my son.
"
,,
2,2,"You are indeed worthy,
"
,,
2,2,"for you have raised a fine son.
"
,,
2,2,"His zest for life is an affirmation
"
,,
2,2,"of God's great love within us all.
"
,,
2,2,"Wow! And that's from the freakin' Pope!
"
,,
2,2,"So I guess you were wrong about me, Dad.
"
,,
2,2,"I was wrong all right.
"
,,
2,2,"Stand by, boys.
"
,,
2,2,"I was wrong about you!
"
,,
2,2,"You've gone soft on me, Holy Father!
"
,,
2,2,"Even a tambourine-shaking Baptist
"
,,
2,2,"could tell this boy's no good!
"
,,
2,2,"Are you calling me a liar?
"
,,
2,2," Whoah, easy, Pontiff.
"
,,
2,2," Because I'll excommunicate your sorry...
"
,,
2,2,"Okay, time out.
"
,,
2,2,"Oh! I have never met
"
,,
2,2,"such an infuriating man!
"
,,
2,2,"You must have the patience of a saint.
"
,,
2,2,"Well, he's my dad.
"
,,
2,2,"And I just want him to love me.
"
,,
2,2,"Peter, how could you say such a thing?
"
,,
2,2,"I love you with all me heart.
"
,,
2,2," You do?
"
,,
2,2," Of course.
"
,,
2,2,"I just don't like you.
"
,,
2,2,"I don't like anything about you!
"
,,
2,2,"Keep playing.
"
,,
2,2,"I think this is as good as it gets.
"
,,
2,2,"Dad, to be honest, I don't like you either.
"
,,
2,2,"Jeez, that's a terrible thing to say.
"
,,
2,2,"I guess I am going to Hell.
"
,,
2,2,"The good Lord said to honor thy father.
"
,,
2,2,"He never said anything about liking him.
"
,,
2,2,"Well, in that case, Dad...
"
,,
2,2,"...l'm gonna eat meat on Fridays,
"
,,
2,2,"golf on Sundays...
"
,,
2,2,"...laugh at Jewish comedians,
"
,,
2,2,"and yes, sleep with my Protestant wife.
"
,,
2,2,"But I won't enjoy it. And she hates it.
"
,,
2,2,"Well, fine. I'll be on me way.
"
,,
2,2,"Take back your job,
"
,,
2,2,"and give your old man a hug.
"
,,
2,2,"I love you, Dad.
"
,,
2,2,"I know you do, Son.
"
,,
2,2," What are you gonna do now?
"
,,
2,2," I don't know.
"
,,
2,2,"I guess the good Lord doesn't have
"
,,
2,2,"much use for an old man like me.
"
,,
2,2,"I suppose I could use
"
,,
2,2,"another pair of hands on my tour.
"
,,
2,2,"You'd give Dad a job,
"
,,
2,2,"even knowing what a jerk he is?
"
,,
2,2,"I have to. As you said, Peter,
"
,,
2,2,"""I am the freakin' Pope.""
"
,,
2,2,"All right, get back!
"
,,
2,2,"No flash photography,
"
,,
2,2,"or you'll go straight to Hell! You!
"
,,
2,2,"You're in God's house, you heathen!
"
,,
2,2,"Take that cap off before I take it off for you!
"
,,
2,2,"I think your father found the perfect job.
"
,,
2,2,"Let's hope so. I love being a good father.
"
,,
2,2,"But I don't want to have to be
"
,,
2,2,"a good son again for a long, long time.
"
,,
2,2,"Peter, open the door,
"
,,
2,2,"and break out the schnapps!
"
,,
2,2,"Guess who needs a place
"
,,
2,2,"to sleep it off for the weekend?
"
,,
2,2," Mom?
"
,,
2,2," Oh, my God, no!
"
,,
2,2,"Quick, everyone! Into the pod!
"
,,
2,3,"It seems today that all you see
"
,,
2,3,"Is violence in movies and sex on TV
"
,,
2,3,"But where are those
"
,,
2,3,"good old-fashioned values
"
,,
2,3,"On which we used to rely?
"
,,
2,3,"Lucky there's a family guy
"
,,
2,3,"Lucky there's a man who positively
"
,,
2,3,"can do all the things that make us
"
,,
2,3,"Laugh and cry
"
,,
2,3,"He's a family guy
"
,,
2,3,"That concludes our special
"
,,
2,3,"half-hour salute to the past 1,000 years.
"
,,
2,3,"We leave you with a look back
"
,,
2,3,"at some of those we've lost this millennium. 
"
,,
2,3,"Kevin asked me to Quagmire's
"
,,
2,3,"millennium party. I am so psyched.
"
,,
2,3,"There's nothing like someone else's party.
"
,,
2,3,"You never have to clean up the mess.
"
,,
2,3,"Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, hey!
"
,,
2,3,"Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, hey!
"
,,
2,3,"Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, hey!
"
,,
2,3,"Well, looks like someone's
"
,,
2,3,"going to a big party tonight.
"
,,
2,3,"You should pick up a chicken-strip party
"
,,
2,3,"pack for all your friends. Here's a coupon.
"
,,
2,3,"Look, pal, I don't take coupons
"
,,
2,3,"from giant chickens. Not after last time.
"
,,
2,3,"Oh, yeah, and that nice chicken
"
,,
2,3,"outside gave me this coupon.
"
,,
2,3,"I'm sorry. This has expired.
"
,,
2,3,"You son of a...
"
,,
2,3," I'm gonna need these by Friday.
"
,,
2,3," Will that give us enough time to...?
"
,,
2,3,"Chicken... gave me a bad coupon.
"
,,
2,3," Some other time, pal.
"
,,
2,3," There won't be any other time.
"
,,
2,3,"The world is gonna end at midnight.
"
,,
2,3," Y2K.
"
,,
2,3," Are you sellin' chicken or sex jelly?
"
,,
2,3,"Haven't you heard? At midnight,
"
,,
2,3,"every computer in the world is gonna fail.
"
,,
2,3,"Planes will fall out of the sky and all
"
,,
2,3,"the world's nuclear weapons will explode,
"
,,
2,3," Annihilating the entire planet.
"
,,
2,3," No!
"
,,
2,3,"Silly rabbit. Trix are for kids.
"
,,
2,3,"Damned long ears, tryin' to take Easter
"
,,
2,3,"away from Jesus. What were you sayin'?
"
,,
2,3,"Hey, Peter, in case you didn't know,
"
,,
2,3,"a balloon tied to a mailbox is the
"
,,
2,3,"international symbol for ""party over here!""
"
,,
2,3,"Forget the party. The world's gonna end.
"
,,
2,3,"Y2K. I heard it from a chicken-man.
"
,,
2,3,"Oh, Peter, you are
"
,,
2,3,"the height of just-too-muchery.
"
,,
2,3,"Laugh, but when you die,
"
,,
2,3,"you'll have to go to heaven.
"
,,
2,3,"And you know what? I bet you run into those
"
,,
2,3,"two dead bailiff ladies from Night Court. 
"
,,
2,3,"And you won't know which one is which.
"
,,
2,3,"And it'll be really awkward. So bite me.
"
,,
2,3," Can you help me with these damned studs?
"
,,
2,3," Aren't you a little overdressed?
"
,,
2,3,"Oh, actually,
"
,,
2,3,"I'm just stopping off at Quagmire's.
"
,,
2,3,"There's a benefit gala
"
,,
2,3,"at the Boston Pops tonight, and...
"
,,
2,3,"well, I'm trying to nail the flautist.
"
,,
2,3,"Oh, Stewie, you're adorable.
"
,,
2,3,"Yes, yes, I rather like the sash.
"
,,
2,3,"But do the Huggies make my ass look big?
"
,,
2,3,"Peter, come on. You've had 1,000 years
"
,,
2,3,"to get ready for this party.
"
,,
2,3,"It always takes him so long to get dressed.
"
,,
2,3,"Peter, we're gonna be late for my cousin's
"
,,
2,3,"wedding. Aren't you dressed yet?
"
,,
2,3,"Oh, crap. Well, one of us
"
,,
2,3,"is gonna have to change.
"
,,
2,3,"Unzip me.
"
,,
2,3," Where's your father?
"
,,
2,3," He's still down in the basement.
"
,,
2,3,"Peter, you've been down there all day.
"
,,
2,3,"I hope they're already...
"
,,
2,3,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
2,3,"The government is here. Run, ET, run!
"
,,
2,3,"The end of the world is comin'.
"
,,
2,3,"Get in your radiation suits.
"
,,
2,3,"We are not missing a once-in-a-lifetime event
"
,,
2,3,"because of some wacko doomsday theory.
"
,,
2,3,"OK, OK. You know that one Christmas
"
,,
2,3,"present you really wanted, but didn't get?
"
,,
2,3," A phone?
"
,,
2,3," A dead Lois?
"
,,
2,3,"Yeah, well, it's in the basement.
"
,,
2,3,"Come on, let's go see.
"
,,
2,3,"What the hell...? Peter,
"
,,
2,3,"if you wanna stay here, that's fine.
"
,,
2,3,"But we're goin' to the party. Kids!
"
,,
2,3," Honey, are you pregnant?
"
,,
2,3," No.
"
,,
2,3,"Oh, dear me. Yes, yes, this is how
"
,,
2,3,"I wanted to enter the new millennium.
"
,,
2,3,"Locked in a basement with imbeciles,
"
,,
2,3,"dressed like a gay Neil Armstrong.
"
,,
2,3,"Thanks a lot. Right now I could be in Boston,
"
,,
2,3,"pretending I give a rat's ass about Vivaldi.
"
,,
2,3," And I could be getting felt up by Kevin.
"
,,
2,3," Now don't you give it all away up front.
"
,,
2,3,"Make him work for it.
"
,,
2,3,"And shame on you, Peter.
"
,,
2,3,"Scarin' the kids with
"
,,
2,3,"your nuclear-holocaust nonsense.
"
,,
2,3,"You said ""nuclear"". It's ""nukular"",
"
,,
2,3,"dumb idiot. The S is silent.
"
,,
2,3,"It's almost midnight.
"
,,
2,3,"We now go live to Asian reporter
"
,,
2,3,"Tricia Takanawa. Tricia, what can you tell us? 
"
,,
2,3,"Quahog's fabled alabaster clam is about
"
,,
2,3,"to descend and usher in a new millennium.
"
,,
2,3," Ten... nine... eight... seven...
"
,,
2,3," This is it.
"
,,
2,3," Six... five... four...
"
,,
2,3," Hold on tight.
"
,,
2,3,"...one... Happy New Year!
"
,,
2,3," A flautist, Peter.
"
,,
2,3," Well, I hope you're happy.
"
,,
2,3,"Come on, kids,
"
,,
2,3,"we can still make the party if we...
"
,,
2,3,"Nice work. Very festive.
"
,,
2,3,"Actually, each light represents
"
,,
2,3,"a missile launching by itself.
"
,,
2,3,"The pattern is just a coincidence.
"
,,
2,3,"Now that you mention it, the Y is
"
,,
2,3,"a bit misshapen. Still, it's pretty amazing.
"
,,
2,3,"What the hell. Come here, Hillary.
"
,,
2,3,"What'd I miss?
"
,,
2,3,"Holy crap! Anybody else feel that?
"
,,
2,3,"Good morning, family. Hey, Lois,
"
,,
2,3,"remember when I was the third Hardy Boy?
"
,,
2,3,"Peter, there was no third Hardy Boy.
"
,,
2,3,"Oh, really?
"
,,
2,3,"Just like there was no apocalypse?
"
,,
2,3,"He shoots, he scores!
"
,,
2,3,"OK, we were wrong about
"
,,
2,3,"the end of the world and you were right.
"
,,
2,3," Can we please just drop it?
"
,,
2,3," It's just not fair.
"
,,
2,3,"I finally get a date with Kevin,
"
,,
2,3,"and he gets vaporised.
"
,,
2,3,"He's just using that as an excuse.
"
,,
2,3,"Let's just be grateful we survived the
"
,,
2,3,"apocalypse healthy and mutation-free.
"
,,
2,3," I said I can do it.
"
,,
2,3," Hey, shut up!
"
,,
2,3," Oh, hey, Clevemire.
"
,,
2,3," That's Quagland.
"
,,
2,3,"Quagland? Oh, you must be dreamin'.
"
,,
2,3,"Not about kickin' your fat ass.
"
,,
2,3,"Boys, please. You used to be so close.
"
,,
2,3,"Sorry, Lois. We're both a little crabby on
"
,,
2,3,"account of the fact that neither one of us
"
,,
2,3,"has had any food
"
,,
2,3,"since we got fused together.
"
,,
2,3,"Well, we just finished off
"
,,
2,3,"what was left in the kitchen.
"
,,
2,3,"When I think back on all the food
"
,,
2,3,"we've wasted in this house.
"
,,
2,3,"Eat, Tom Selleck. Come on. Down the hatch.
"
,,
2,3,"Come on. Hey, hey! None for you, Higgins.
"
,,
2,3,"Tryin' to steal Tom Selleck's food.
"
,,
2,3,"No. No. You've had yours.
"
,,
2,3,"Thank goodness Peter bought a huge supply
"
,,
2,3,"of dehydrated meals before the blast.
"
,,
2,3,"Peter, whaddaya doin'?
"
,,
2,3,"You just ate a year's worth of food.
"
,,
2,3,"What a waste of money. I'm still hungry.
"
,,
2,3,"Everyone leave. I have to poop.
"
,,
2,3,"Now!
"
,,
2,3,"Well, so much for finding food
"
,,
2,3,"at the Stop 'N Shop.
"
,,
2,3,"It figures. The one time I remember
"
,,
2,3,"my value-club card.
"
,,
2,3,"Wait a minute, I smell barbecue.
"
,,
2,3,"So, whaddaya think, Diane?
"
,,
2,3,"Can I cook or what?
"
,,
2,3,"Delicious, Tom. I guess
"
,,
2,3,"we should be eating her with chopsticks.
"
,,
2,3,"Oh, my God. They're eating
"
,,
2,3,"Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa.
"
,,
2,3,"That's crazy. They're just
"
,,
2,3,"gonna be hungry again in an hour.
"
,,
2,3,"Come on, Woody.
"
,,
2,3,"We're gonna search for food.
"
,,
2,3," Sorry, Chris, the plant can't come.
"
,,
2,3," It's his best friend.
"
,,
2,3,"Lois, it'll just be another mouth to feed.
"
,,
2,3,"I'll take care of Woody, son.
"
,,
2,3,"What was that?
"
,,
2,3," Nothing. Let's go.
"
,,
2,3," Go where?
"
,,
2,3,"If there's no food in Quahog,
"
,,
2,3,"why should there be food anywhere else?
"
,,
2,3,"Lois, everyone knows there are only two
"
,,
2,3,"things that can survive a nukular holocaust:
"
,,
2,3,"cockroaches and Twinkees.
"
,,
2,3,"And there's a Twinkee factory in Natick.
"
,,
2,3," Twinkees?
"
,,
2,3," Yeah, I saw a story about 'em on A&E.
"
,,
2,3,"And now, back to A&E's biography:
"
,,
2,3,"Twinkee the Kid.
"
,,
2,3,"It was difficult for Twink
"
,,
2,3,"to play with other children. 
"
,,
2,3,"He was different. He was definitely... 
"
,,
2,3,"He had no bones, 
"
,,
2,3,"and he couldn't really play any sports. 
"
,,
2,3," That's why we got him the lasso. 
"
,,
2,3," Yeah. 
"
,,
2,3,"He's spend hours in the back yard
"
,,
2,3,"playing Wonder Woman. 
"
,,
2,3," He's gonna kill me. 
"
,,
2,3," He loved that lasso. 
"
,,
2,3,"He... Not as much as the baton. 
"
,,
2,3,"But, uh... we put a stop to the baton. 
"
,,
2,3,"He... he was different enough, you know. 
"
,,
2,3,"We gotta get to that factory
"
,,
2,3,"and we'll have all the food we need.
"
,,
2,3,"Well, goodbye sweet home.
"
,,
2,3,"Maybe someday we'll return.
"
,,
2,3," Hey, Joe, can you keep an eye on the place?
"
,,
2,3," I might as well. I'm melted to the ground.
"
,,
2,3,"There you go.
"
,,
2,3,"These oughta keep the rats away.
"
,,
2,3,"Thanks. Stay in school.
"
,,
2,3,"Bring it on!
"
,,
2,3,"Look, Peter, people.
"
,,
2,3," Halt.
"
,,
2,3," Uh-oh.
"
,,
2,3,"I am Jorad. I and my band
"
,,
2,3,"of highway warriors control this territory.
"
,,
2,3," Do you have food?
"
,,
2,3," No, that's why we're on the road.
"
,,
2,3,"Then you may not pass
"
,,
2,3,"until you answer the following question:
"
,,
2,3,"Name something you'd take on a picnic.
"
,,
2,3," A blanket.
"
,,
2,3," Potato salad.
"
,,
2,3," A dead Lois?
"
,,
2,3," OK, we're gonna go with potato salad.
"
,,
2,3,"Show me potato salad.
"
,,
2,3,"Maybe we should go now.
"
,,
2,3," Aw, jeez. Outta gas!
"
,,
2,3," Hey, Dad, look.
"
,,
2,3,"Well, howdy, strangers.
"
,,
2,3,"You look plumb tuckered.
"
,,
2,3," Like to sit a spell?
"
,,
2,3," Actually, we are tired.
"
,,
2,3," And hungry.
"
,,
2,3," Well, we got plenty o' room here.
"
,,
2,3," And all the fresh apples you can eat.
"
,,
2,3," Oh, Peter, we found a new home.
"
,,
2,3," We're goin' to Natick.
"
,,
2,3," For what?
"
,,
2,3,"A Twinkee factory
"
,,
2,3,"that might not even exist any more?
"
,,
2,3,"She's right. Besides, this place is paradise.
"
,,
2,3," Sure is, except for Randy Newman.
"
,,
2,3," Randy Newman?
"
,,
2,3,"Yep. Just sits there all night and day,
"
,,
2,3,"singin' about what he sees.
"
,,
2,3,"Fat man with his kids and dog
"
,,
2,3,"Drove in through the morning fog
"
,,
2,3,"Hey, there, Rover
"
,,
2,3,"Come on over
"
,,
2,3,"Well, it's nice to have music while we eat.
"
,,
2,3,"Red-headed lady
"
,,
2,3,"Reachin' for an apple
"
,,
2,3,"Gonna take a bite
"
,,
2,3,"Uh, no, no
"
,,
2,3,"She's gonna breathe on it first
"
,,
2,3,"Wipes it on her blouse
"
,,
2,3,"She takes a bite
"
,,
2,3,"Chews it once
"
,,
2,3,"Twice, three times
"
,,
2,3,"Four times
"
,,
2,3,"Stops
"
,,
2,3,"Saliva working
"
,,
2,3,"Takes a long, hard look at Randy
"
,,
2,3,"Five times
"
,,
2,3,"Fat, old husband walking over
"
,,
2,3,"Let's get the hell outta here.
"
,,
2,3,"They're walking down the road
"
,,
2,3,"Left foot, right foot
"
,,
2,3,"Left foot, right foot
"
,,
2,3,"Left...
"
,,
2,3,"Left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot
"
,,
2,3,"Please, Chris, Mommy's got
"
,,
2,3,"a very big headache. Stop it!
"
,,
2,3,"Thank you, sweetie.
"
,,
2,3,"Now, Peter, we've gotta find some food.
"
,,
2,3,"Oh, my God. Look!
"
,,
2,3,"It's Natick.
"
,,
2,3,"There's no factory?
"
,,
2,3,"Oh, very good, fat man.
"
,,
2,3,"We've followed the pied piper to the gates
"
,,
2,3,"of oblivion and look what it's brought us.
"
,,
2,3,"We're finished. We're done.
"
,,
2,3,"Game over, man. Game over.
"
,,
2,3," Dammit!
"
,,
2,3," Get outta that nuclear waste.
"
,,
2,3,"Who knows what animals have been in there?
"
,,
2,3,"It's about damn time.
"
,,
2,3,"Oh, words...
"
,,
2,3,"Should've sent a poet.
"
,,
2,3," There's enough food to last us for ever.
"
,,
2,3," We're saved. You were right.
"
,,
2,3,"We can settle down here and
"
,,
2,3,"build a house just like we had in Quahog.
"
,,
2,3,"Yeah, and we can build a mall
"
,,
2,3,"so I have a place to hang out.
"
,,
2,3,"And two Denny's, so we can say ""Let's not
"
,,
2,3,"go to that one. Let's go to the good one.""
"
,,
2,3,"We can dig Joe out of the driveway
"
,,
2,3,"and we can build a community
"
,,
2,3,"just like the one we had.
"
,,
2,3,"No, we'll build a better one.
"
,,
2,3,"I hereby proclaim this city New Quahog.
"
,,
2,3,"Well, this isn't very good, now, is it?
"
,,
2,3,"Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
"
,,
2,3," Guess who?
"
,,
2,3," Stop it, Chris.
"
,,
2,3,"Wrong!
"
,,
2,3,"Oh, wait. Did you say ""Chris""?
"
,,
2,3,"Stewie, time for breakfast!
"
,,
2,3,"Did you wash your tentacles?
"
,,
2,3,"My big, handsome boy.
"
,,
2,3,"What the devil are you talking about?
"
,,
2,3,"I'm repugnant.
"
,,
2,3,"I'm a radio-bloody-active freak.
"
,,
2,3,"Yeah, I fold. Hey, come on.
"

2,3,"Let's go home and get tender with your wife.
"
,,
2,3,"I don't know, Quagmire. Lovemaking
"
,,
2,3,"with Loretta has somehow lost its intimacy.
"
,,
2,3,"All right.
"
,,
2,3,"Excuse me, Mr Mayor. We have an outsider
"
,,
2,3,"who wishes to join our community.
"
,,
2,3,"Welcome to my fair city.
"
,,
2,3,"If you wanna become a citizen,
"
,,
2,3,"you have to get a job.
"
,,
2,3," Before the disaster, I was a physician.
"
,,
2,3," That's terrific. We need a doctor.
"
,,
2,3,"We sure do. Let's hope you get it.
"
,,
2,3,"Now, pick a job out of the hat.
"
,,
2,3,"Ah, village idiot. That's a good one.
"
,,
2,3,"On Tuesdays you get to
"
,,
2,3,"wave your penis at traffic.
"
,,
2,3,"Congratulations.
"
,,
2,3,"Maybe we shoulda just let him be a doctor.
"
,,
2,3,"No. These are the rules of New Quahog.
"
,,
2,3,"That's how everyone else got their jobs.
"
,,
2,3,"Go!
"
,,
2,3,"You see, Doc, my back tooth is killin' me.
"
,,
2,3,"And things have worked out fine so far.
"
,,
2,3,"Peter, no offence, but that's
"
,,
2,3,"because we all pitched in.
"
,,
2,3," We've built schools and hospitals.
"
,,
2,3," Not to mention the theatre.
"
,,
2,3,"But when I saw the movie,
"
,,
2,3,"it looked like Audrey Hepburn
"
,,
2,3,"not only didn't have breakfast at Tiffany's,
"
,,
2,3,"she hadn't eaten anything in a year.
"
,,
2,3,"I'm such a bitch.
"
,,
2,3,"We have everything we need.
"
,,
2,3,"And no crime, no guns, no pollution.
"
,,
2,3,"Brian's right.
"
,,
2,3,"We've left ourselves defenceless.
"
,,
2,3," Guys, we need to make some guns.
"
,,
2,3," Guns? Guns only lead to trouble.
"
,,
2,3,"And when that trouble happens,
"
,,
2,3,"we'll blow its freaking head off.
"
,,
2,3,"Without guns, how would our forefathers
"
,,
2,3,"have settled their differences?
"
,,
2,3,"Eight, nine, ten.
"
,,
2,3,"And turn.
"
,,
2,3,"Honey, Mommy's making you
"
,,
2,3,"some new feetie pyjamas.
"
,,
2,3,"And look, it has a little trap door
"
,,
2,3,"for when you gotta make inky.
"
,,
2,3,"I'll show you inky.
"
,,
2,3," Let's see if they fit, hm?
"
,,
2,3," Never! Eugh.
"
,,
2,3,"Ha, ha, ha, look at me! I'm Fred Astaire.
"
,,
2,3," Aaah!
"
,,
2,3," Gotcha.
"
,,
2,3,"Oh, you are gettin' heavy.
"
,,
2,3,"I'll have your father flood the basement,
"
,,
2,3,"so you can get more exercise.
"
,,
2,3,"Yes, yes. I do seem
"
,,
2,3,"to have gained a bit of girth.
"
,,
2,3,"Actually, my gullet seems to be rumbling.
"
,,
2,3,"There we are. Oh, I say. I've laid an egg.
"
,,
2,3,"That wasn't so bad. I don't know what
"
,,
2,3,"these women are always complaining about.
"
,,
2,3,"Attention, New Quahogians.
"
,,
2,3,"Today, my vision for our future comes true.
"
,,
2,3,"A chicken in every pot and a cap in every ass.
"
,,
2,3,"Put that away. Where did you get
"
,,
2,3,"the metal for all those guns?
"
,,
2,3,"Recycling. I used the pipes
"
,,
2,3,"from our irrigation system.
"
,,
2,3,"Are you crazy?
"
,,
2,3,"You destroyed all our water pipes?
"
,,
2,3,"We don't need guns. We need food and water.
"
,,
2,3,"I have a canker sore on my lip,
"
,,
2,3,"and I keep pokin' at it with my tongue,
"
,,
2,3," But that's only makin' it worse.
"
,,
2,3," There's a reason I'm in charge here.
"
,,
2,3,"I'm the one who knew the world was
"
,,
2,3,"gonna end and found the Twinkee factory.
"
,,
2,3," And I gave elocution lessons to Rosie Perez.
"
,,
2,3," That's nothing to be proud of.
"
,,
2,3,"Don't be stupid.
"
,,
2,3,"She speak good and everything.
"
,,
2,3," Let's get him outta here!
"
,,
2,3," Throw him out!
"
,,
2,3,"Wait! We can work this out!
"
,,
2,3,"I haven't been thrown outta any place
"
,,
2,3,"since I was a counsellor at the bulimia clinic.
"
,,
2,3,"Aw, man. Did anybody else throw up
"
,,
2,3,"after eatin' that fish last night?
"
,,
2,3," That's the last of 'em.
"
,,
2,3," Good riddance.
"
,,
2,3,"What the hell would we ever need guns for?
"
,,
2,3,"Victory is ours!
"
,,
2,3,"Quick, grab the guns! They're our only hope.
"
,,
2,3,"You remember the other day you were
"
,,
2,3,"asking me what the definition of irony was?
"
,,
2,3,"And I said...
"
,,
2,3,"Honey, I'm sorry I got us
"
,,
2,3,"kicked outta New Quahog.
"
,,
2,3,"I guess nobody really needs guns.
"
,,
2,3,"I'm not always right after all.
"
,,
2,3,"Oh, Peter, hearing you say that almost
"
,,
2,3,"makes it worth havin' the world blown up.
"
,,
2,3,"Where are we gonna go?
"
,,
2,3,"I hear there's a Carvel factory in Framingham.
"
,,
2,3,"All right! Fudgie the Whale, and Cookie Puss,
"
,,
2,3,"and Cookie O'Puss,
"
,,
2,3,"and Nutty the Chocolate Ghost.

2,3,"Come on, everybody. Let's sing a song.

2,3," Bobby.
"

2,3," Good morning.
"

2,3,"Oh, Bobby, I just had the weirdest dream.
"

2,3,"I dreamt I saw
"
,,
2,3,"the strangest episode of Family Guy, 
"
,,
2,3,"and there was a giant chicken
"
,,
2,3,"and Stewie was an octopus.
"

2,3,"Hey, hey, hey. Come on, now.
"
,,
2,3,"It's all right. Everything's going to be OK.

"

"

2,4,"It looks like Stewie
"

"
,,
2,4,"Oh, Lois. Again?
"
,,
2,4,"That baby just does not
"

"
,,
2,4,"Here you are! What the hell is this?
"
,,
2,4,"Sweetie, that's tuna salad.
"
,,
2,4,"Oh, is that what it is? Really? I could have
"
,,
2,4,"sworn it was mayonnaise and cat food.
"
,,
2,4,"Here's 50 cents. Do me a favour, sweetheart.
"
,,
2,4,"Next time you're shopping, why not
"
,,
2,4,"splurge on a tin of solid white albacore?
"
,,
2,4,"Stewie, are you upset because
"
,,
2,4,"you went wee-wee on the carpet?
"
,,
2,4," What did you just say?
"
,,
2,4," Hey, Lois... Did you pee in here?
"
,,
2,4,"In a moment. What did you just say?
"
,,
2,4,"Peter, we have a serious problem
"
,,
2,4,"we need to discuss.
"
,,
2,4,"Oh, jeez. This isn't another
"
,,
2,4,"one of those interventions, is it?
"
,,
2,4,"Peter, you've been wearing that giant
"
,,
2,4,"foam cowboy hat for eight months now.
"
,,
2,4,"Please, for your family, take it off.
"
,,
2,4,"Hey, I can take this hat off any time I want.
"
,,
2,4,"I just don't want to.
"
,,
2,4,"Get away!
"
,,
2,4,"No, it's Stewie. He peed on the carpet.
"
,,
2,4," Do I... do I hit him?
"
,,
2,4," No!
"
,,
2,4," Bend down, Mother.
"
,,
2,4," Yes, honey?
"
,,
2,4,"How dare you sully my good name
"
,,
2,4,"by spreading slanderous filth!
"
,,
2,4,"Stewie, no hitting. Use your words.
"
,,
2,4,"He's probably just ashamed, Lois.
"
,,
2,4,"You're a helpless little

2,4,"carpet tinkler, aren't you?
"
,,
2,4,"Well! The outrages I have suffered today

"

2,4,"I will not be forgetting... those outrages.
"
,,
2,4,"No, no! No, they won't be forgotten.
"
,,
2,4," Not the...
"
,,
2,4," Outrages, yeah. I think we got it.
"
,,
2,4,"Oh!
"
,,
2,4,"Maybe it's time for Stewie
"
,,
2,4,"to start potty training.
"
,,
2,4,"Isn't he too young? You know
"
,,
2,4,"what happened to the Lindbergh baby.
"
,,
2,4," Charles, he's only six months old.
"
,,
2,4," Honey, would you relax?
"
,,
2,4,"God, I flew across the Atlantic by myself.
"
,,
2,4,"I'm a national treasure, for God's sake.
"
,,
2,4,"I think I know how to...
"
,,
2,4,"Oh, God! Oh, God!
"
,,
2,4,"All right... He was kidnapped.
"
,,
2,4,"You call the police, I'll write the ransom note.
"
,,
2,4,"What about Amelia? She saw everything.
"
,,
2,4,"You leave her to me.
"
,,
2,4,"Come on, honey. He's been having accidents.
"
,,
2,4,"Maybe he's trying to tell us he's ready.
"
,,
2,4,"This could be a nice way
"
,,
2,4,"for you and Stewie to bond.
"
,,
2,4,"Bond?
"
,,
2,4,"James Bond.
"
,,
2,4,"All right, Lois. I'll do it.
"
,,
2,4,"Oh, God. Not again, Brian.
"
,,
2,4,"Why can't you stop peeing on the carpet?
"
,,
2,4,"Dammit! It's not coming out.
"
,,
2,4," Brian, is that you?
"
,,
2,4," Uh, yeah, it's me.
"
,,
2,4," Is everything OK?
"
,,
2,4," Yeah, I just... I couldn't sleep.
"
,,
2,4," I'll be up in a minute.
"
,,
2,4," OK.
"

2,4,"Join us tomorrow for more ""Price is Right"".

"
,,
2,4," No!
"
,,
2,4," Oh, this has gotta stop.
"
,,
2,4,"Oh, God! It smells gross!
"
,,
2,4,"Princess, I don't see anyone
"
,,
2,4,"dabbing yours behind their ears.
"
,,
2,4,"It looks like someone
"
,,
2,4,"already tried to clean it up.
"
,,
2,4," No, it doesn't.
"
,,
2,4," Mine smells like soda.
"
,,
2,4," I'm looking for toilet-training books.
"
,,
2,4," Yes, we can help you there.
"
,,
2,4,"Everybody Poops is still
"
,,
2,4,"the standard, of course.
"
,,
2,4,"We've also got the less popular
"
,,
2,4,"Nobody Poops But You. 
"
,,
2,4," Huh. See, we're Catholic, so...
"
,,
2,4," Then you want You're a Naughty Child
"
,,
2,4,"and That's Concentrated Evil
"
,,
2,4,"Coming Out the Back of You. 
"
,,
2,4,"Perfect!
"
,,
2,4," Brian, what are you doing?
"
,,
2,4," Hi, Lois. I was just washing some things.
"
,,
2,4,"Those look like our sheets and our quilt.
"
,,
2,4,"They are. I'm washing them
"
,,
2,4,"with some fabric softener.
"
,,
2,4,"They were so itchy I couldn't sleep,
"
,,
2,4,"which is why I was downstairs
"
,,
2,4,"when you asked me if I was OK
"
,,
2,4,"and I said I couldn't sleep.
"
,,
2,4,"You know, cos it was so itchy.
"
,,
2,4,"Come on, Stewie. Don't you wanna
"
,,
2,4,"pee in the toilet bowl like a big boy?
"
,,
2,4,"I remember when I learned
"
,,
2,4,"to use a potty all by myself.
"
,,
2,4,"I was so proud.
"
,,
2,4,"Hey, Lois. I did it!
"
,,
2,4,"Well, perhaps I could give it
"
,,
2,4,"the old college try.
"
,,
2,4,"Why don't you put your hands right there?
"
,,
2,4," It'll help me relax.
"
,,
2,4," OK, buddy.
"
,,
2,4,"Aagh!
"
,,
2,4,"Maybe you don't have to pee. I oughta just
"
,,
2,4,"give you some beer. Goes right through you.
"
,,
2,4,"Wonderful. And while we're at it,
"
,,
2,4,"we can light up a doobie and watch porn.
"
,,
2,4,"Yeah?
"
,,
2,4,"Listen, you, I'll use these facilities
"
,,
2,4,"when I'm damn well ready.
"
,,
2,4,"Until then, you shall continue
"
,,
2,4,"to sanitise my crevasse
"
,,
2,4,"and be damn grateful
"
,,
2,4,"for the opportunity-starting right...
"
,,
2,4,"Well, not now. But soon!
"
,,
2,4,"Oh, and I want these and these and these.
"
,,
2,4," Only one.
"
,,
2,4," But... but that man over there got two.
"
,,
2,4,"Peter, I don't care what the other men
"
,,
2,4,"are getting. You're only getting one.
"
,,
2,4,"I hate you!
"
,,
2,4," Hey, what's that sound?
"
,,
2,4," You're urinating!
"
,,
2,4,"So, it's been you all along!
"
,,
2,4,"Oh, this is too perfect!
"
,,
2,4,"I've been taking the blame for Rex.
"
,,
2,4," Ew! It's everywhere!
"
,,
2,4," It's OK. Meg, hand me my sweater.
"
,,
2,4,"Brian, where d'you think you are, Payless?
"
,,
2,4,"I say, I say! Paco, grab a mop. Will
"
,,
2,4,"somebody get Patches the hell out of here
"
,,
2,4,"before he bends a French biscuit
"
,,
2,4,"on the conveyor belt?
"
,,
2,4,"Sh. It's OK.
"
,,
2,4,"We'll meet you in the parking lot.
"
,,
2,4,"Oh, God, Lois. I need help.
"
,,
2,4,"Look, I... I really don't even know why
"
,,
2,4,"I'm here. The urologist said I was fine.
"
,,
2,4,"Sometimes these things
"
,,
2,4,"can be psychological.
"
,,
2,4,"Doubt that. I've got a very comfortable life.
"
,,
2,4,"I live with a great family, my needs are met.
"
,,
2,4,"OK, look, so maybe this isn't where
"
,,
2,4,"I thought I was gonna be at seven years old.
"
,,
2,4,"It's just that... I...
"
,,
2,4,"Is it OK if I smoke in here?
"
,,
2,4,"Thanks.
"
,,
2,4,"It's just that things don't always
"
,,
2,4,"work out the way we plan.
"
,,
2,4,"You know, I've never been to Europe.
"
,,
2,4,"Now look at me. Middle-aged,
"
,,
2,4,"alone and peeing in supermarkets.
"
,,
2,4,"Man, didn't see that coming.
"
,,
2,4,"I had this dream last night.
"

"
,,
2,4,"Oh. What about him?
"
,,
2,4,"He's gotta be in his fifties.
"
,,
2,4," So what do you think?
"
,,
2,4," I think you're very sensitive
"
,,
2,4,"and you put up a tough front.
"
,,
2,4,"I think you're in pain.
"
,,
2,4," Damn it, Brian. Do not cry.
"
,,
2,4," I'd like to pet you, Brian.
"
,,
2,4,"Would that be OK?
"
,,
2,4,"You're a good dog, Brian. A very good...

"

"

"

"
,,
2,4," Well, I think I have a bit of ""me"" work to do.
"
,,
2,4," But I'm feeling things, and that's a start.
"
,,
2,4," Oh, that's wonderful.
"
,,
2,4,"Like most other people, I used to think
"
,,
2,4,"therapy was only for crazies and nut jobs.
"
,,
2,4,"Isn't that silly?
"

2,4,"Hey, Lois, I...
"

"
,,
2,4,"They let you out already?

2,4,"I was in a therapy session,
"
,,
2,4,"not a lunatic asylum.
"
,,
2,4,"Hey, calm down. Lots of crazy people have
"
,,
2,4,"gone on to lead normal, successful lives.
"
,,
2,4,"What did your therapist say?
"
,,
2,4,"Dr Kaplan thinks the, uh... accidents
"
,,
2,4,"are linked to some kind of midlife crisis.
"
,,
2,4,"He suggested I go out into the world and
"
,,
2,4,"pursue my dreams. I'm leaving tomorrow.
"
,,
2,4,"Whoa, hang on. I gave you
"
,,
2,4,"one of the ones with silverware in it.
"
,,
2,4,"Take this one instead.
"
,,
2,4,"That one's probably fine.
"
,,
2,4,"Beautiful.
"
,,
2,4,"Aagh!
"
,,
2,4," Oh, my God! Are you Stephen King?
"
,,
2,4," No, I'm Dean Koontz.
"
,,
2,4,"Oh.
"
,,
2,4,"But, you know,
"
,,
2,4,"thanks to these sessions, I think I'm OK.
"
,,
2,4,"Being out in the world,
"
,,
2,4,"feeling my power-and no accidents.
"
,,
2,4," I've been dry for two weeks now.
"
,,
2,4," Mazel tov.
"
,,
2,4,"Well, goodbye, Dr Kaplan. And thank you.
"
,,
2,4,"I know Stacey isn't your mother,
"
,,
2,4,"but upside-down face or not,
"
,,
2,4,"you have to respect her!
"
,,
2,4,"Hey, you're Tom Tucker.
"
,,
2,4,"Hey!
"
,,
2,4,"Oh, God, I'm s... That was rude. I apologise.
"
,,
2,4,"Wow.
"
,,
2,4,"I'm a little teapot, short and stout
"
,,
2,4,"Here is my handle, here is my spout
"
,,
2,4,"When I get all steamed up, hear me shout
"
,,
2,4,"Lois, it looks as if Puddles has done it again!
"
,,
2,4,"Goodness! He's wet everything.
"
,,
2,4,"Ha! Ha! Ha!
"
,,
2,4,"I swear, I don't even remember doing it.
"
,,
2,4,"I don't understand this.
"
,,
2,4,"Now, Brian, we know
"
,,
2,4,"you're not doing this on purpose,
"
,,
2,4,"but maybe we should consider... crating.
"
,,
2,4," Oh, God.
"
,,
2,4," Or you could be an outside dog.
"
,,
2,4,"Huh? Would you like that?
"
,,
2,4,"Huh? Outside?
"
,,
2,4,"Oh, oh, and how embarrassed was I
"
,,
2,4,"when the word ""crate"" came up!
"
,,
2,4,"I thought I was past this.
"
,,
2,4,"I travelled the world, for God's sake.
"
,,
2,4," You know how much I spent?
"
,,
2,4," Obviously we haven't hit the real issue yet.
"
,,
2,4,"Drop it. Tell me, Brian,
"
,,
2,4,"the last accident you remember,
"
,,
2,4,"did anything unusual happen to trigger it?
"
,,
2,4,"Oh, no, it was a normal day.
"
,,
2,4," Oh, Catwoman?
"
,,
2,4," Peter, no Catwoman today. I'm tired.
"
,,
2,4,"What's the matter? Is the mighty Catwoman
"
,,
2,4,"afraid of a little Catwoman melting spray?
"
,,
2,4,"Peter, no. Peter...
"
,,
2,4,"All right! OK!
"
,,
2,4,"Enough, Batman. I don't...
"
,,
2,4,"Not so mighty now, are you, Catwoman?
"
,,
2,4," Peter!
"
,,
2,4," Take that! Take that!
"
,,
2,4,"I spit water at you!
"
,,
2,4,"Peter! Peter! Batman, I can't breathe.
"
,,
2,4,"Peter!
"
,,
2,4,"Oh, I'm using my special cat power
"
,,
2,4,"to get Batman all wet.
"
,,
2,4,"Meow!
"
,,
2,4,"Meow!
"
,,
2,4,"You know, just the usual stuff.
"
,,
2,4," All that running water. That's gotta be it!
"
,,
2,4," Mm-hm.
"
,,
2,4," Brian, tell me about Lois.
"
,,
2,4," Lois. Well, she's a fantastic woman.
"
,,
2,4,"She's compassionate
"
,,
2,4,"and charming, attractive.
"
,,
2,4,"Well, stunning really.
"
,,
2,4,"I guess you could say I really...
"
,,
2,4," Love her?
"
,,
2,4," No, of course not.
"
,,
2,4,"Me and Lois? That's sick.
"
,,
2,4," Come on, she's my best friend's wife.
"
,,
2,4," Mm-hm.
"
,,
2,4,"Look, I love Lois, but I'm not in love with her.
"
,,
2,4,"Mm-hm. Who are you trying
"
,,
2,4,"to convince, Brian, me or you?
"
,,
2,4,"Oh, Brian, Brian. What a mess.
"
,,
2,4,"Don't get antsy. I got three minutes left.
"
,,
2,4,"So what the hell, Brian? You cured yet?
"
,,
2,4,"I don't wanna have to live with plastic
"
,,
2,4,"on the furniture like some Italian family.
"
,,
2,4," My therapist's figured out my problem.
"
,,
2,4," What does Sigmund Fraud think it is?
"
,,
2,4,"He, uh... thinks I'm in love.
"
,,
2,4,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
2,4,"You can talk!
"
,,
2,4," Never mind.
"
,,
2,4," Does this girl love you back?
"
,,
2,4," I... I can't imagine.
"
,,
2,4," You gotta find out for sure.
"
,,
2,4,"You don't wanna spend your life
"
,,
2,4,"wondering what could have been.
"
,,
2,4," Sir, I need a decision.
"
,,
2,4," Uh, uh...
"
,,
2,4,"Uh, salad.
"
,,
2,4,"No, wait! Soup! Soup!
"
,,
2,4,"But it was too late.
"
,,
2,4,"And to this day I still lay awake at night
"
,,
2,4,"wondering about the soup that got away.
"
,,
2,4,"Thanks, Peter.
"
,,
2,4,"I'm gonna go find out how she feels.
"
,,
2,4," I've taken you for granted.
"
,,
2,4," Get a room!
"
,,
2,4," Hey, you, the news is on.
"
,,
2,4," Where is everybody?
"
,,
2,4,"Stewie's taking a nap
"
,,
2,4,"and Peter and the kids are out.
"
,,
2,4," Come sit with me.
"
,,
2,4," Oh, OK.
"
,,
2,4,"Huh, huh.
"
,,
2,4,"Ohhhhh!
"
,,
2,4,"And now Part 3 of Asian correspondent
"
,,
2,4,"Tricia Takanawa's special report on sex. 
"
,,
2,4,"Thank you, Diane.
"
,,
2,4,"Sex-some people have it anonymously.
"
,,
2,4,"""What kind of person would do that?""
"
,,
2,4,"you might ask.
"
,,
2,4,"Well, I'm about to find out.
"
,,
2,4,"I just picked up
"
,,
2,4,"a complete stranger in a hotel bar
"
,,
2,4,"and he's in the bathroom right now,
"
,,
2,4,"possibly doing drugs.
"
,,
2,4,"Watch as I have sex with
"
,,
2,4,"this potentially dangerous man,
"
,,
2,4,"as we take you in-depth and undercover.
"
,,
2,4,"I've never had a Spanish chick before. Ol!
"
,,
2,4,"It is so refreshing to see something
"
,,
2,4,"other than violence on the news.
"
,,
2,4," Your tail keeps hitting me.
"
,,
2,4," If it's bothering you, I can stop.
"
,,
2,4,"That's OK. The breeze feels good.
"
,,
2,4,"It's so warm in here.
"
,,
2,4,"Ooh.
"
,,
2,4,"That's better.
"
,,
2,4,"I'd take my sweater off,
"
,,
2,4,"but I'm afraid it's attached to my skin.
"
,,
2,4,"Mm.
"
,,
2,4,"Smooth.
"
,,
2,4,"Well, I'd better go start dinner.
"
,,
2,4,"Oh!
"
,,
2,4,"Well, well, well!
"
,,
2,4,"How long have you been there?
"
,,
2,4,"I came about the time you started
"
,,
2,4,"pummelling her with your tail.
"
,,
2,4," You shut up.
"
,,
2,4," You love her.
"
,,
2,4,"Ha! Oh, oh, this is so good,
"
,,
2,4,"it just has to be fattening.
"
,,
2,4," I said shut up!
"
,,
2,4," Oh, by the way, nice rap.
"
,,
2,4,"""I'd take my sweater off, but I'm afraid it's
"
,,
2,4,"attached to my skin."" Ha! Ha! Ha! Imbecile.
"
,,
2,4,"Britney and Amber were,
"
,,
2,4,"like, ""Let's go to the mall.""
"
,,
2,4,"I was, like, ""I'll go to the mall.""
"
,,
2,4,"Then Amber wasn't gonna go.
"
,,
2,4,"So I went to the mall, and you're not
"
,,
2,4,"gonna believe it-they both showed up!
"
,,
2,4,"Hold on. Meg, Meg, I'm sorry.
"
,,
2,4,"That is a really boring story.
"
,,
2,4,"I haven't been this bored
"
,,
2,4,"since that stupid drive-in movie.
"
,,
2,4,"This sucks!
"
,,
2,4,"Lois, this pasta-better than Italy.
"
,,
2,4,"It's just my noodle caboodle.
"
,,
2,4,"But I did use a different brand
"
,,
2,4,"of potato chips for the crust.
"
,,
2,4,"Your culinary prowess is surpassed
"
,,
2,4,"only by your unfailing grace
"
,,
2,4,"and the uncommon, sometimes haunting,
"
,,
2,4,"glow of sensuality that surrounds you.
"
,,
2,4," It's just noodle caboodle.
"
,,
2,4," Hey, what are these hard things?
"
,,
2,4,"M&M's. I ran out of paprika.
"
,,
2,4," Magnificent.
"
,,
2,4," Up, up. Stewie wants to go uppie.
"
,,
2,4,"You want me to pick you up, sweetie?
"
,,
2,4,"Mama's skin's so soft.
"
,,
2,4,"My goodness, you're affectionate tonight!
"
,,
2,4,"Well, let me give my big boy a kiss.
"
,,
2,4,"Another! Another! Yes!
"
,,
2,4,"Mama has candy kisses!
"
,,
2,4,"All right, that's enough!
"
,,
2,4,"I mean, would you all excuse me, please?
"
,,
2,4,"Stewie, did... did you unhook Mommy's bra?
"
,,
2,4," Uh, hi.
"
,,
2,4," Well, hello, Brian.
"
,,
2,4," I... I think we should talk.
"
,,
2,4," Sure.
"
,,
2,4,"Lois... did your heart
"
,,
2,4,"ever want to ask something
"
,,
2,4,"but your head was too afraid
"
,,
2,4,"of what the answer might be?
"
,,
2,4,"Oh. Oh, God.
"
,,
2,4,"Sometimes it's best
"
,,
2,4,"not to ask those questions.
"
,,
2,4,"Sometimes we should cherish
"
,,
2,4,"what we already have,
"
,,
2,4,"like a very special friendship,
"
,,
2,4,"let's say like the one you and I share,
"
,,
2,4,"that someone like me wouldn't change
"
,,
2,4,"for anything in the world.
"
,,
2,4,"Someone like me wouldn't change it
"
,,
2,4,"for anything in the world either.
"
,,
2,4,"I'm glad.
"
,,
2,4,"To be clear-we were talking about me being
"
,,
2,4,"in love with you and you rejecting me, right?
"
,,
2,4," Yes.
"
,,
2,4," I was just making sure.
"
,,
2,4,"Say we were drunk
"
,,
2,4,"and knew we wouldn't remember?
"
,,
2,4,"I'd have to be really, really... No!
"
,,
2,4,"I tell you, Peter,
"
,,
2,4,"I wish I'd taken this up years ago.
"
,,
2,4,"My great-great-great uncle Angus Griffin
"
,,
2,4,"invented the game.
"
,,
2,4,"So we're all clear on the rules, then?
"
,,
2,4,"No Jews and no blacks.
"
,,
2,4,"Aye.
"
,,
2,4," You're like the Arnold Palmer of golf.
"
,,
2,4," Yeah, life is good.
"
,,
2,4,"I'm seven years old, and if I play my cards
"
,,
2,4,"right, I've got seven years ahead of me.
"
,,
2,4," Whatever happened with your lady friend?
"
,,
2,4," We decided to stay good friends.
"
,,
2,4,"There are a lot of different kinds of love,
"
,,
2,4,"and ours was perfect the way it was.
"
,,
2,4,"So she dumped you, huh? To hell with her.
"
,,
2,4,"She'll probably end up with some idiot.
"
,,
2,4,"Serves her right!
"
,,
2,4,"Damn.
"
,,
2,4,"Damn.
"
,,
2,4,"Damn.
"

2,4,"Damn.

2,5,"Good evening. I'm Diane Simmons.
"

2,5,"A stunning development tonight
"
,,
2,5,"as O.J. Simpson is proven innocent.
"
,,
2,5,"We have the identity of the real killer.
"
,,
2,5,"But first...
"
,,
2,5,"It's fall. The time of year when the leaves
"

2,5,"turn a pretty, purpley orange...
"
,,
2,5,"...and Quahog prepares
"
,,
2,5,"for its annual Harvest Festival Parade.
"
,,
2,5,"Asian reporter Trisha Takanawa
"
,,
2,5,"joins us live...
"
,,
2,5,"...from the ceremony where
"
,,
2,5,"they are choosing this year's theme.
"
,,
2,5,"Diane, behind me are 1,000 beautiful doves.
"
,,
2,5,"Gently tied to each of their delicate legs
"
,,
2,5,"is a parade theme...
"
,,
2,5,"...suggested by
"
,,
2,5,"ordinary citizens of Quahog.
"
,,
2,5,"And here to pick
"
,,
2,5,"this year's winning theme...
"
,,
2,5,"...is Ten Commandments star,
"
,,
2,5,"Charlton Heston.
"
,,
2,5,"Let my pigeons go!
"
,,
2,5,"He nailed one! We have our theme!
"
,,
2,5,"I submitted ""togetherness.""
"
,,
2,5,"A simple theme.
"
,,
2,5,"But powerful, nonetheless.
"
,,
2,5,"Come on, ""overcoming adversity""!
"
,,
2,5,"Let's go, ""overcoming adversity""!
"
,,
2,5,"Show me ""women I gave the clap to""!
"
,,
2,5,"And the Harvest Festival Parade theme is:
"
,,
2,5,"""The episode of Who's the Boss?
"
,,
2,5,"""...where Tony sees Angela
"
,,
2,5,"naked in the shower.""
"
,,
2,5,"Yes! That's mine! Un-freaking-believable!
"
,,
2,5,"Clumsy oaf! Michael Flatley
"
,,
2,5,"must be turning over in his grave.
"
,,
2,5,"Wait a minute. He's not dead yet.
"
,,
2,5,"""Michael Flatley.""
"
,,
2,5,"It's great they picked your theme,
"
,,
2,5,"but isn't it a little esoteric?
"
,,
2,5,"Esoteric?
"
,,
2,5," Could it mean ""sexy""?
"
,,
2,5," I think it's a science term.
"
,,
2,5,"Fellas, esoteric means ""delicious.""

"
,,
2,5,"I swear to God, if you touched her...
"
,,
2,5,"Honey, what happened?
"
,,
2,5,"It was lunchtime and...
"
,,
2,5,"I love the color of your Prada bag.
"
,,
2,5," Yeah, but yours has that great clasp.
"
,,
2,5," Hey, Meg, you want to come to lunch?
"
,,
2,5,"You know what? There's no room
"

2,5,"in my car for your big, ugly purse.
"
,,
2,5,"Meg, let me tell you about popularity.
"

2,5,"Mrs. Canner? Are you coming?
"
,,
2,5,"Bye!
"
,,
2,5,"Daddy, if you really loved me,
"
,,
2,5,"you'd buy me a Prada bag.
"
,,
2,5,"I can't say no to you, honey.
"
,,
2,5,"What are they, like, $10?
"
,,
2,5,"More like $1,100.
"
,,
2,5,"You wish I loved you that much!
"
,,
2,5,"We'll never finish the float
"
,,
2,5,"in time for the parade.
"
,,
2,5,"Pick up the pace, guys!
"
,,
2,5,"Peter, your theme is a dud.
"
,,
2,5,"Yeah. I've never even seen
"
,,
2,5,"Who's the Boss?
"
,,
2,5,"Tuesdays in the '80s I was always
"
,,
2,5,"in bed by 8:00 and home by 11:00.
"
,,
2,5,"But I can't do it without you guys,
"
,,
2,5,"because I'll tell you who's the boss.
"
,,
2,5,"It's not Tony or Angela.
"
,,
2,5,"It's not even man-crazy Mona. It's all of us.
"
,,
2,5,"You're the boss because you never
"
,,
2,5,"give up, like with the ladies.
"
,,
2,5,"Gemini.
"
,,
2,5,"Capricorn.
"
,,
2,5,"I know you're not a Virgo!
"
,,
2,5,"From down here, you look like a Pisces!
"
,,
2,5,"And Cleveland, you're the boss
"
,,
2,5,"because of your attention to detail.
"
,,
2,5,"Like when we play pool,
"
,,
2,5,"you take so long to line up your shots...
"
,,
2,5,"...I just want to crack you with a cue stick.
"
,,
2,5,"But I don't because that would be
"
,,
2,5,"a hate crime, and I love you.
"
,,
2,5,"And Joe, I've had new neighbors before,
"
,,
2,5,"but none were half the man you are.
"
,,
2,5,"Since you're half a man already,
"
,,
2,5,"that splits them...
"
,,
2,5,"...into some kind of fraction
"
,,
2,5,"I can't even measure.
"
,,
2,5,"He's right. If we work together,
"
,,
2,5,"we can win this thing. Who's in?
"
,,
2,5,"Go, Spooner Street!
"
,,
2,5,"My dad always says,
"
,,
2,5,"""Measure twice, cut once.""
"
,,
2,5,"My daddy always said,
"
,,
2,5,"""Cleveland Jr., quit jumping on the bed!""
"
,,
2,5,"We didn't measure!
"
,,
2,5,"Amazing. The whole
"
,,
2,5,"neighborhood is working together.
"
,,
2,5,"You know what's really amazing?
"
,,
2,5,"I haven't brushed my teeth in three days,
"
,,
2,5,"and no one has said a thing.
"
,,
2,5,"If I had a job, I could buy the bag myself.
"
,,
2,5,"I have squandered my munitions budget
"
,,
2,5,"on that insipid Rugrats video!
"
,,
2,5,"Perhaps I should seek employment.
"
,,
2,5,"Mother teaches piano.
"
,,
2,5,"I suppose I could as well.
"
,,
2,5,"All right, try it again, Richard.
"
,,
2,5,"And remember,
"
,,
2,5,"the wrong keys are electrified.
"
,,
2,5,"I don't want to play the piano!
"
,,
2,5,"Indeed.
"
,,
2,5,"Would you rather play the bassoon?
"

2,5,"No experience? No, thanks.
"

2,5,"Oh, nuts. Young lady.
"

2,5,"What's the little guy's name?

2,5,"What do you care?

,,
2,5,"...and clipped onto it
"
,,
2,5,"is a list of this year's float entries.
"
,,
2,5,"Remember, the float that best captures
"
,,
2,5,"this year's theme...
"
,,
2,5,"...wins Quahog's coveted Golden Clam.
"
,,
2,5,"And here's our first float.
"
,,
2,5,"It looks like some wires
"
,,
2,5,"got crossed on Clover Street.
"
,,
2,5,"That's not Angela.
"
,,
2,5,"That's Mona, Angela's mom.
"
,,
2,5,"Wonderful use of tree bark
"
,,
2,5,"for the age spots though.
"
,,
2,5,"This one's got Tony bathing Jonathan.
"
,,
2,5,"That's just plain wrong.
"
,,
2,5,"Each float possesses its own
"
,,
2,5,"unique charm. But none of them...
"
,,
2,5,"Oh, baby! Look at that!
"
,,
2,5,"The float turned out great.
"
,,
2,5,"Our neighborhood hasn't been this united
"
,,
2,5,"since Quagmire got us free cable.
"
,,
2,5,"We are not bad people.
"
,,
2,5,"We just don't want to pay $12 a month
"
,,
2,5,"for Cinemax.
"
,,
2,5,"First place goes to Spooner Street.
"
,,
2,5,"We won! All right!
"
,,
2,5,"Come on now! This is damn foolish!
"
,,
2,5,"My theme, my trophy!
"
,,
2,5,"My aunt Fanny!
"
,,
2,5,"You said it yourself! I'm the boss!
"
,,
2,5,"He said I, too, was the boss.
"
,,
2,5,"And it's time Cleveland got his due.
"
,,
2,5,"Joe, my feet are starting to swell.
"
,,
2,5,"You two go home.
"
,,
2,5,"I can stay here as long as it takes.
"
,,
2,5,"You'd be amazed how little one eats
"
,,
2,5,"when your legs don't work.
"
,,
2,5,"There's only one way to settle this.
"
,,
2,5,"Russian Roulette.
"
,,
2,5,"Three bullets, last guy standing
"
,,
2,5,"keeps the trophy. Me first.
"
,,
2,5,"No. Wait a minute, this is crazy.
"
,,
2,5,"You first.
"
,,
2,5,"There's gotta be a way for you all
"
,,
2,5,"to enjoy the trophy.
"
,,
2,5,"Wait a minute! I got it! No, lost it.
"
,,
2,5,"There it is again!
"
,,
2,5,"Perfect, Peter.
"
,,
2,5,"Now we can all enjoy it.
"
,,
2,5,"Here's to togetherness!
"
,,
2,5,"Car!
"
,,
2,5,"Meg, order up!
"
,,
2,5,"Here you go, hon. From Flappy himself.
"
,,
2,5,"I don't care if they're
"
,,
2,5,"from Kubla filthy-wretched Khan!
"
,,
2,5,"Try them. You'll like them.
"
,,
2,5,"Yes, well, I rather doubt that.
"
,,
2,5,"Yes! These are delectable.
"
,,
2,5,"Flappy, good news!
"
,,
2,5,"I've decided not to kill you!
"
,,
2,5,"What a precious little boy.
"
,,
2,5,"That's my son.
"
,,
2,5,"Your son? But you're just a baby yourself.
"
,,
2,5,"Henry, give the little skank a nice tip.
"
,,
2,5,"$20!
"
,,
2,5,"Welcome to Flappy's.
"
,,
2,5,"Why don't you sit next to my baby...
"
,,
2,5,"...whose deadbeat dad
"
,,
2,5,"doesn't pay child support.
"
,,
2,5,"Peter, what is it?
"
,,
2,5,"What's going on out here?
"
,,
2,5,"Clear the way! I'm a cop!
"
,,
2,5,"Oh, my God! I thought the safety was on.
"
,,
2,5,"I'm so sorry.
"
,,
2,5,"That's okay, son.
"
,,
2,5,"It's your right as an American citizen.
"
,,
2,5,"What's all the noise?
"
,,
2,5,"I was just jerked out of a sound sleep.
"
,,
2,5,"Perhaps someone could enlighten me as
"
,,
2,5,"to the whereabouts of our Golden Clam?
"
,,
2,5," Maybe it fell.
"
,,
2,5," Yeah. Right into someone's pocket.
"
,,
2,5,"You think one of us stole it?
"
,,
2,5,"I never said the word ""stole."" Looks like
"
,,
2,5,"someone has a guilty conscience.
"
,,
2,5,"Guilty conscience!
"
,,
2,5,"I'm the only guy on this block
"
,,
2,5,"who actually pays for his cable.
"
,,
2,5,"Pretty high and mighty for a man
"
,,
2,5,"who left our nation's flag out in the rain...
"
,,
2,5,"...last Fourth of July.
"
,,
2,5,"That's against the law, Officer!
"
,,
2,5,"You're one to talk.
"
,,
2,5,"Out there every trash day
"
,,
2,5,"picking through my garbage.
"
,,
2,5,"That's an invasion of my privacy.
"
,,
2,5,"He's sorting your recycling
"
,,
2,5,"because he loves our Mother Earth.
"
,,
2,5,"If you weren't so busy
"
,,
2,5,"trolling for booty all the time...
"
,,
2,5,"...you could do it yourself,
"
,,
2,5,"like the law says you should.
"
,,
2,5,"It's on now!
"
,,
2,5,"Wait a second! What about Peter?
"
,,
2,5,"He's the one
"
,,
2,5,"who wanted the trophy all along!
"
,,
2,5,"I couldn't have stolen it.
"
,,
2,5,"Last night I was stealing Joe's ladder
"
,,
2,5,"so I could steal the trophy tonight.
"
,,
2,5,"What? It's a ladder. He can't use it.
"
,,
2,5,"It's like taking a watch off a dead guy.
"
,,
2,5,"Those Griffins always were oddballs, Joe.
"
,,
2,5,"Real oddballs.
"
,,
2,5,"I don't trust them.
"
,,
2,5,"I saw them taking coupons
"
,,
2,5,"out of our mailbox.
"
,,
2,5,"I don't like the look of her!
"
,,
2,5,"I offer you a recipe.
"
,,
2,5,"Combine one small-town neighborhood
"
,,
2,5,"with a dash of missing trophy...
"
,,
2,5,"...and what you're left with is a gumbo
"
,,
2,5,"fit only for a madman.
"
,,
2,5,"A gumbo served almost exclusively in The...
"
,,
2,5,"Who the hell is that?
"
,,
2,5,"I bet he took it!
"
,,
2,5,"Where are you going, Serling?
"
,,
2,5,"Want some of this?
"
,,
2,5,"Come back here!
"
,,
2,5,"I'm off to work.
"
,,
2,5,"Okay, honey.
"
,,
2,5,"One of our neighbors took that trophy,
"
,,
2,5,"and I'll find out who.
"
,,
2,5," I'm taking Stewie with me again.
"
,,
2,5," Fine, sweetie.
"
,,
2,5,"This whole thing just makes me sick!
"
,,
2,5," We played Pictionary with them!
"
,,
2,5," Bastards!
"
,,
2,5,"Giddy-up, you stubby little mare!
"
,,
2,5,"To the pancake house!
"
,,
2,5,"Well, bye.
"
,,
2,5,"And to think
"
,,
2,5,"they used to be our best friends!
"
,,
2,5,"That was then and this is now!
"
,,
2,5,"And this is a chair. That's a lamp.
"
,,
2,5,"You have boobies. I'll find that trophy!
"
,,
2,5,"To be honest, Peter, we were all
"
,,
2,5,"a little surprised you invited us over.
"
,,
2,5,"We realized our friendship is a lot
"
,,
2,5,"more important than some stupid trophy.
"
,,
2,5,"There's the tea. I'll get it, Lois.
"
,,
2,5,"Two sugars, right, Bonnie?
"
,,
2,5,"Damn, it's not here!
"
,,
2,5,"Not here either.
"
,,
2,5,"Nothing.
"
,,
2,5,"Oh, my God! We were robbed!
"
,,
2,5," Is anything missing?
"
,,
2,5," No. I don't think so.
"
,,
2,5,"Where's that picture of me
"
,,
2,5,"in my two-piece?
"
,,
2,5,"Should I call the cops?
"
,,
2,5,"I'm guessing a cop
"
,,
2,5,"had something to do with this.
"
,,
2,5,"Or a pilot. Or a deli owner.
"
,,
2,5,"Okay, you dirtbags!
"
,,
2,5,"This means war!
"
,,
2,5,"Excuse us. We're having a small problem
"
,,
2,5,"with home security.
"
,,
2,5,"Do you have those round metal things
"
,,
2,5,"that you bury in the ground...
"
,,
2,5,"...and, when stepped on, they explode?
"
,,
2,5," Land mines?
"
,,
2,5," Land mines.
"
,,
2,5,"It was land mines.
"
,,
2,5," Quagmire.
"
,,
2,5," Peter.
"
,,
2,5," Cleveland.
"
,,
2,5," Joe.
"
,,
2,5," Bonnie.
"
,,
2,5," Lois.
"
,,
2,5," Cleveland.
"
,,
2,5," Lois.
"
,,
2,5,"Bonnie.
"
,,
2,5," Quagmire.
"
,,
2,5," Peter.
"
,,
2,5,"Loretta.
"
,,
2,5,"Come on, Peter.
"
,,
2,5,"That ought to slow them down.
"
,,
2,5,"Being a single mother is hard.
"
,,
2,5,"The real challenge is having a baby
"
,,
2,5,"that's addicted to crack.
"
,,
2,5," Right, Stewie?
"
,,
2,5," What's that? Yes. I love crack.
"
,,
2,5,"I'm absolutely coo-coo for crack!
"
,,
2,5,"This is the first time he's eaten something
"
,,
2,5,"other than dog food in three weeks.
"
,,
2,5,"Here's your check. God bless.
"
,,
2,5,"Here, Honey.
"
,,
2,5,"What's this? Blueberries?
"
,,
2,5,"Oh, my...
"
,,
2,5,"That's better than sex!
"
,,
2,5,"And could I get that waitress' address?
"
,,
2,5,"I'd like to help her baby.
"
,,
2,5,"What are they up to?
"
,,
2,5,"Cleveland and Quagmire
"
,,
2,5,"are holding their positions...
"
,,
2,5,"...but I haven't seen Joe all day.
"
,,
2,5,"Freeze!
"
,,
2,5,"Dad?
"
,,
2,5,"Careful.
"
,,
2,5,"There's a bear trap two feet to your right.
"
,,
2,5,"Thanks, Dad.
"
,,
2,5,"Look out for your mother!
"
,,
2,5,"There's a sandwich
"
,,
2,5,"on the counter, honey.
"
,,
2,5,"Cleveland, these lobster traps
"
,,
2,5,"aren't going to catch any intruders.
"
,,
2,5,"Yes, they will.
"
,,
2,5,"I baited them with these plump
"
,,
2,5,"and tasty Fenway franks.
"
,,
2,5,"Daddy, we got one!
"
,,
2,5,"Fat boy smelled a hot dog.
"
,,
2,5,"Couldn't help it. Went right in.
"
,,
2,5," Hello.
"
,,
2,5," Say, get the hell off...
"
,,
2,5,"Hello, lips, legs, breasts, and ass.
"
,,
2,5,"Yes. I was hoping I could ask you
"
,,
2,5,"about your neighbors, the Griffins.
"
,,
2,5,"A bunch of card-carrying Commies
"
,,
2,5,"if you ask me!
"
,,
2,5,"All right.
"
,,
2,5,"No! It's not all right!
"
,,
2,5,"Fat boy!
"
,,
2,5,"The Griffins are not to be trusted.
"
,,
2,5,"Those people are nothing
"
,,
2,5,"but vile, cheating, lying scum.
"
,,
2,5,"And their carpet and drape scheme...
"
,,
2,5,"No! No, I won't!
"
,,
2,5,"Get that puree of loathsomeness
"
,,
2,5,"away from me!
"
,,
2,5,"But you love mashed turkey and peas.
"
,,
2,5,"I'm sorry. What was that?
"
,,
2,5,"Sorry, I didn't quite catch that.
"
,,
2,5,"Did you just tell me what I love?
"
,,
2,5,"Write this down, you toad-faced frump.
"
,,
2,5,"I love pancakes!
"
,,
2,5,"Hi, little fella.
"
,,
2,5,"Is Meg Griffin here?
"
,,
2,5,"No, she's not.
"
,,
2,5,"Probably out scoring more rock.
"
,,
2,5,"Sandy Balfour, Child Services.
"
,,
2,5,"We're placing this baby in a foster home.
"
,,
2,5," What?
"
,,
2,5," For God's sake, feed me!
"
,,
2,5,"Let me guess. All out of Puppy Chow?
"
,,
2,5,"What an awful home for a child!
"
,,
2,5,"How dare you! This is a wonderful home!
"
,,
2,5,"Quagmire, you rat bastard!
"
,,
2,5,"Come near my fence again,
"
,,
2,5,"and that'll be your head!
"
,,
2,5,"Shut up!
"
,,
2,5,"Honey, would you like some pancakes?
"
,,
2,5,"Oh, yes! God, yes! Take me!
"
,,
2,5,"Stewie!
"
,,
2,5,"Next up is Meg Griffin,
"
,,
2,5,"sporting her stylishly cool, brand-new...
"
,,
2,5,"A woman from Child Services
"
,,
2,5,"came and took Stewie!
"
,,
2,5,"She said we fed him dog food!
"
,,
2,5,"Dog food?
"
,,
2,5,"Is that a real Prada bag?
"
,,
2,5,"How in the world did you make $1,100
"
,,
2,5,"as a waitress in one week?
"
,,
2,5,"It's easy...
"
,,
2,5,"...when you're the unwed teenage mother
"
,,
2,5,"of a crack-addicted baby.
"
,,
2,5,"Wait a minute.
"
,,
2,5,"Meg, when did you become a teenager?
"
,,
2,5,"She's 16, Peter.
"
,,
2,5,"You knew about this?
"
,,
2,5,"Welcome to your new home.
"
,,
2,5,"Baby Stewie,
"
,,
2,5,"say hello to your new brothers and sisters.
"
,,
2,5,"Hola, Stewie.
"
,,
2,5,"Ni hao, Stewie.
"
,,
2,5,"Stewie.
"
,,
2,5,"Good God!
"
,,
2,5,"I've been adopted by a Benetton ad!
"
,,
2,5," I promise, it'll never happen again.
"
,,
2,5," I hope not, Mrs. Stevens.
"
,,
2,5,"Because next time we won't
"
,,
2,5,"just take him away, we'll kill him.
"
,,
2,5,"Let's see. Stanley, Starkweather, Stevens!
"
,,
2,5,"So this is where babies come from?
"
,,
2,5,"Yes, Chris.
"
,,
2,5,"This is where babies come from.
"
,,
2,5,"You told me I came out of your vagina!
"
,,
2,5,"Next!
"
,,
2,5,"Hi. Yeah, we're the Griffins.
"
,,
2,5," I'm sorry. I can't find your paperwork.
"
,,
2,5," Look harder! I want my baby back!
"
,,
2,5,"Please, let me handle this.
"
,,
2,5,"The name's Griffin.
"
,,
2,5,"We're the ones who fed dog food
"
,,
2,5,"to our crack-addicted baby.
"
,,
2,5,"I never was any good
"
,,
2,5,"at dealing with the authorities.
"
,,
2,5,"Don't worry. I know how to handle this.
"
,,
2,5,"Are you aware you were going 50 in...
"
,,
2,5,"I'm gonna have to ask you
"
,,
2,5,"to put your shirt down.
"
,,
2,5,"Crap.
"
,,
2,5,"I get the one straight cop in Rhode Island.
"
,,
2,5,"Damn it! I want pancakes!
"
,,
2,5,"You people understand every language
"
,,
2,5,"except English!
"
,,
2,5,"Yo quiero pancakes!
"
,,
2,5,"Donnez-moi pancakes!
"
,,
2,5,"Click-click-bloody-click pancakes!
"
,,
2,5,"Poor little guy.
"
,,
2,5,"""Pancakes"" must be street for ""crack.""
"
,,
2,5,"Damn those parents of his.
"
,,
2,5,"Sarah, forgiveness.
"
,,
2,5,"Now, Stewie,
"
,,
2,5,"why don't you go play with the others?
"
,,
2,5,"Stewie, come complete our rainbow!
"
,,
2,5,"I've got a better idea.
"
,,
2,5,"Let's go play
"
,,
2,5,"""swallow the stuff under the sink.""
"
,,
2,5,"You lied to them!
"
,,
2,5,"You told Child Services that we steal
"
,,
2,5,"lawn mowers and cheat on our taxes...
"
,,
2,5,"...and worship some guy named Stan.
"
,,
2,5,"Actually, I said Satan. That's a typo.
"
,,
2,5,"We didn't know who she was!
"
,,
2,5,"It's not our fault!
"
,,
2,5,"No? Then whose fault is it?
"
,,
2,5,"It's all of yours!
"
,,
2,5,"You were all working together just fine,
"
,,
2,5,"but then you won that stupid trophy.
"
,,
2,5,"You put some shiny hunk of metal
"
,,
2,5,"before your own friendships.
"
,,
2,5,"Brian's right.
"
,,
2,5,"We were so obsessed with that trophy,
"
,,
2,5,"we lost sight of what was really going on.
"
,,
2,5," Now we have a real problem to deal with.
"
,,
2,5," That's right!
"
,,
2,5,"Somebody tipped off the cable company
"
,,
2,5,"about our free Cinemax.
"
,,
2,5,"Joe?
"
,,
2,5,"And we have to get Stewie back!
"
,,
2,5,"I remembered.
"
,,
2,5,"We're here to help.
"
,,
2,5,"And we must get our baby back.
"
,,
2,5,"Right on! Let's do it!
"
,,
2,5,"Rock their world!
"
,,
2,5,"Yeah! Come on!
"
,,
2,5,"Let's go! We can do it!
"
,,
2,5,"See kids? One day the world
"
,,
2,5,"is going to be just like our home.
"
,,
2,5,"All races living together
"
,,
2,5,"in harmony and love.
"
,,
2,5,"Pancakes!
"
,,
2,5,"He must still be working the junk
"
,,
2,5,"out of his system.
"
,,
2,5,"He needs hugs!
"
,,
2,5,"Doorbell!
"
,,
2,5,"We're from the One World,
"
,,
2,5,"One People Book-of-the-Month Club.
"
,,
2,5,"Is there something missing in your life?
"
,,
2,5,"You know, I just bet there is.
"
,,
2,5,"Sarah, we have guests!
"
,,
2,5,"And one of them is a homosexual!
"
,,
2,5,"They're in place!
"
,,
2,5,"God, it gets me hot
"
,,
2,5,"when Joe lies to strangers.
"
,,
2,5,"When I get him home,
"
,,
2,5,"I swear I'm gonna grease up...
"
,,
2,5,"That's fine, Debbie. Go, Chris.
"
,,
2,5,"Here we go, Dad!
"
,,
2,5,"Stewie, would you like
"
,,
2,5,"to learn how to wrap a turban?
"
,,
2,5,"Why don't you teach it to the Chinese girl?
"
,,
2,5,"Or perhaps she can learn
"
,,
2,5,"after her people invade your country.
"
,,
2,5,"Yee, would your people really do this?
"
,,
2,5,"Try and stop them.
"
,,
2,5,"And try and stop Pablo's people
"
,,
2,5,"from using drug money to buy arms...
"
,,
2,5,"...from Li's countrymen,
"
,,
2,5,"who in turn sells them to Ura's people...
"
,,
2,5,"...so they can ethnically cleanse
"
,,
2,5,"this nauseatingly diverse...
"
,,
2,5,"...grab bag of genetic party favors
"
,,
2,5,"you call a family.
"
,,
2,5,"So now you all understand, yes?
"
,,
2,5,"You all hate each other?
"
,,
2,5,"Hosanna! It's the lesser of two evils.
"
,,
2,5,"Hey, kids. I'm Santa Claus.
"
,,
2,5,"Just practicing for Christmas.
"
,,
2,5,"But you're white.
"
,,
2,5,"Jack and Sarah told me Santa is Indian.
"
,,
2,5,"Don't be stupid! Santa is black!
"
,,
2,5,"Santa can't be black. We do not fear him.
"
,,
2,5,"Cram it, Gandhi!
"
,,
2,5,"Santa is Asian.
"
,,
2,5,"How can he be Asian?
"
,,
2,5,"Santa doesn't drive his sled 20 miles
"

2,5,"under the speed limit with his blinker on!
"
,,
2,5,"Go back to your rice paddy, Mulan!
"
,,
2,5,"Come on, Stewie.
"
,,
2,5,"We're out of here.
"
,,
2,5,"Dance, puppets! Dance!
"
,,
2,5,"Lois, we got him. It's all over.
"
,,
2,5,"Careful, Peter.
"
,,
2,5,"Joe and Cleveland can't stall them.
"
,,
2,5,"They're heading your way!
"
,,
2,5,"Crap!
"
,,
2,5,"Hold it right there!
"
,,
2,5,"Or what?
"
,,
2,5,"Don't shoot!
"
,,
2,5,"Now shoot!
"
,,
2,5,"So, we're terribly sorry
"
,,
2,5,"we broke into your home.
"
,,
2,5,"But we just had to
"
,,
2,5,"get Stewie back somehow.
"
,,
2,5,"That's a very long story.
"
,,
2,5,"But we've grown attached to little Stewie.
"
,,
2,5,"Plus, the law's on our side.
"
,,
2,5,"You people can kiss
"
,,
2,5,"the fattest part of my ass!
"
,,
2,5,"We'll be back, Stewie.
"
,,
2,5,"Wait!
"
,,
2,5,"Is that a real Prada bag?
"
,,
2,5,"I'd like to propose a toast to our neighbors.
"
,,
2,5,"Sure they may be black, handicapped,
"
,,
2,5,"and a heartless sex hound...
"
,,
2,5,"...but if they moved out,
"
,,
2,5,"some smelly Hawaiians might move in.
"
,,
2,5," Hear, hear!
"
,,
2,5," Where's Quagmire?
"
,,
2,5,"If it wasn't for him,
"
,,
2,5,"we never would have found out...
"
,,
2,5,"...where Stewie's foster family lived.
"
,,
2,5,"He said he'd distract the social worker.
"
,,
2,5,"Glen, honey, I have a question for you.
"
,,
2,5,"What do you do for a living?
"
,,
2,5,"I have a question for you, too.
"
,,
2,5,"Why are you still here?
"
,,
2,5,"What the heck happened
"
,,
2,5,"to that trophy anyway?
"
,,
2,5,"I guess some mysteries
"
,,
2,5,"are better left unsolved.
"
,,
2,5,"Submitted for your approval.
"
,,
2,5,"A family pet with the uncontrollable urge
"
,,
2,5,"to bury shiny objects in the yard.
"
,,
2,5,"A shameful secret that nearly buried the
"
,,
2,5,"peace and civility of an entire neighbor...
"
,,
2,5,"Stewie seems a little feverish
"
,,
2,5,"after his ordeal.
"
,,
2,5,"And he keeps asking for pancakes.
"
,,
2,5,"Let's just let him rest.
"
,,
2,5,"Flappy, what have you done to me?
"
,,
2,5,"It's so hot.
"
,,
2,5,"Now I'm freezing!
"
,,
2,5,"What I wouldn't do
"
,,
2,5,"for one syrup-soaked bite.

2,6,"How long do I have?
"

2,6,"Mr. Griffin, I'd say you have
"

2,6,"about a month to live.
"
,,
2,6,"But what the hell do I know?
"
,,
2,6,"I've been sued by every patient I ever had.
"

2,6,"Look at the size of this file.
"

2,6,"This is... Wow.
"

2,6,"Let's just wait for the test results.

2,6,"No! I shall put you down
"

2,6,"for a nap, Mother!
"
,,
2,6,"Blast!
"
,,
2,6,"I'm so worried about your father.
"
,,
2,6,"You mean because
"
,,
2,6,"he's a borderline alcoholic?
"
,,
2,6,"No. Mommy's made peace with that.
"

2,6,"Because he's got a lump on his booby.

2,6,"Look. Here they are. My family.
"

2,6,"Anyone?
"
,,
2,6,"You can't die! Who's gonna take me

"
,,
2,6,"Listen, I've had a good life.
"

2,6,"You can always be proud of your father

2,6,"Accomplishments?
"
,,
2,6,"Go to your room.
"

2,6,"Peter, there's no way you could die.
"

2,6,"You're the most important character
"
,,
2,6,"in this family.
"
,,
2,6,"I'll take this one.
"
,,
2,6,"But I won't pay a cent over $60.
"
,,
2,6,"Sir, that casket costs $1,000.
"
,,
2,6,"Okay, $70.
"
,,
2,6,"What?
"
,,
2,6,"$2,000.
"
,,
2,6,"That's twice the cost!
"
,,
2,6,"$40.
"
,,
2,6,"What?
"
,,
2,6,"He doesn't know how to haggle.
"
,,
2,6,"Peter, what's going on?
"
,,
2,6,"I'm selling all my worldly goods,
"
,,
2,6,"so you'll have some cash when I'm dead.
"
,,
2,6,"Yeah, a lot of memories here.
"
,,
2,6,"Look, my first bike.
"
,,
2,6,"Boy, I had so much fun playing with that.
"
,,
2,6,"More tea, Mr. Bike?
"
,,
2,6,"Peter, this is ridiculous.
"
,,
2,6,"You're going to be fine.
"
,,
2,6,"Dad, the doctor called.
"
,,
2,6,"Your test results are in.
"
,,
2,6,"This doesn't look very good.
"
,,
2,6,"No, this doesn't look very good at all.
"
,,
2,6,"My nephew drew my portrait.
"

2,6,"It doesn't look a thing like me.
"
,,
2,6,"Look at the nose. It's all...
"
,,
2,6,"Will you just tell us about Peter's tests?
"
,,
2,6,"Okay. Mr. Griffin,
"
,,
2,6,"all your tests came back negative.
"
,,
2,6,"As it turns out, the lump on your chest
"
,,
2,6,"was just a fatty corpuscle.
"
,,
2,6,"Fatty corpuscle? Wait a minute.
"
,,
2,6,"How the hell can a dead comedian...
"
,,
2,6,"...from the silent movie era
"
,,
2,6,"be lodged in my left bosom?
"
,,
2,6,"Mr. Griffin, I'm saying you're fine.
"
,,
2,6,"I'm fine? What?
"
,,
2,6,"Are you coming on to me now?
"
,,
2,6,"Peter, he's not coming on to you.
"
,,
2,6,"He's trying to tell you that you're healthy.
"
,,
2,6,"Can't it be both?
"
,,
2,6,"My sweetie is okay.
"
,,
2,6,"Better than okay, Lois.
"
,,
2,6,"From now on, I'm gonna appreciate...
"
,,
2,6,"...all the little things in life,
"
,,
2,6,"like you and the kids.
"
,,
2,6,"Is this the price of my bill
"
,,
2,6,"or my phone number?
"
,,
2,6,"Your phone number.
"
,,
2,6,"It's still pretty pricey!
"
,,
2,6,"Peter, who cares how much it is?
"
,,
2,6,"You've just got the most important
"
,,
2,6,"bill of all, a clean bill of health.
"
,,
2,6,"Jeez, Lois. How long you been waiting
"
,,
2,6,"to crack out that gem?
"
,,
2,6,"This sucks, Brian.
"
,,
2,6,"Why should I have to pay this?
"
,,
2,6," There's nothing wrong with me.
"
,,
2,6," Too bad you're not dying.
"
,,
2,6,"Wait a second. That's it!
"
,,
2,6,"They can't make a dead guy pay his bill.
"
,,
2,6,"All I gotta do is write ""deceased""
"
,,
2,6,"right here where it says ""name.""
"
,,
2,6,"And where it says ""sex,""
"
,,
2,6,"I'll write, ""No, thanks. I'm dead.""
"
,,
2,6,"It's bulletproof.
"
,,
2,6,"But you promised
"
,,
2,6,"the fat one would perish.
"
,,
2,6,"I know. Isn't it wonderful, honey?
"
,,
2,6,"Your father is alive and well...
"
,,
2,6,"...and we can be a family for a good long...
"
,,
2,6,"Who are you?
"
,,
2,6,"I'm Calista Flockhart. Who the
"
,,
2,6,"hell do you think I am? I'm Death.
"
,,
2,6,"Which one of you is Peter Griffin?
"
,,
2,6,"He is.
"
,,
2,6,"Come on, man.
"
,,
2,6,"Which one of you is Peter Griffin?
"
,,
2,6,"This is Peter Griffin.
"
,,
2,6,"That's a good one.
"
,,
2,6,"Why are you...
"
,,
2,6,"No, wait.
"
,,
2,6,"I'm not finished holding my sides.
"
,,
2,6,"Why are...
"
,,
2,6,"Why...
"
,,
2,6,"Why are you here?
"
,,
2,6,"The doctor said Peter was okay.
"
,,
2,6,"The doctor!
"
,,
2,6,"I guess he must know, right?
"
,,
2,6,"I mean, he's a doctor and everything,
"
,,
2,6,"and I'm just Death!
"
,,
2,6,"Excuse me. Hello!
"
,,
2,6,"I'm Stewie. Big fan.
"
,,
2,6,"Death, you made a mistake.
"
,,
2,6,"I'm not supposed to be dead.
"
,,
2,6,"I made a mistake? What's this?
"
,,
2,6,"Peter, is that your handwriting?
"
,,
2,6,"How did you get that?
"
,,
2,6,"Your HMO emailed it to me.
"
,,
2,6,"I know my doctor was hitting on me,
"
,,
2,6,"but you don't have to call him names.
"
,,
2,6,"I don't care what that says!
"
,,
2,6,"You can't take my husband!
"
,,
2,6,"Mother! Where are your manners?
"
,,
2,6,"Don't argue with our guest!
"
,,
2,6,"Won't you join us for dinner?
"
,,
2,6,"Oh, no. I don't want to impose.
"
,,
2,6,"Is that turkey?
"
,,
2,6,"Yes, Death.
"
,,
2,6,"We were in the middle of a turkey dinner
"
,,
2,6,"to celebrate Peter's good health.
"
,,
2,6,"Do you mind?
"
,,
2,6,"Mind? Of course not.
"
,,
2,6,"It would be an honor.
"
,,
2,6,"No, it would be a privilege. Oh, dear.
"
,,
2,6,"Listen to me prattling on like a schoolgirl.
"
,,
2,6,"Come, come.
"
,,
2,6,"You, heat up some gravy for our guest!
"
,,
2,6,"My last helping of white meat
"
,,
2,6,"was drier than Oscar Wilde.
"
,,
2,6,"How did you do that?
"
,,
2,6,"Let's just say,
"
,,
2,6,"when I was younger...
"
,,
2,6,"...I did some films
"
,,
2,6,"I'm not particularly proud of.
"
,,
2,6,"That does it for me.
"
,,
2,6,"Wait! You can't go.
"
,,
2,6,"After dinner,
"
,,
2,6,"we usually go into the living room...
"
,,
2,6,"...and live for another 40 or 50 years.
"
,,
2,6,"I guess this is good-bye.
"
,,
2,6,"Meg, you're the man of the family now.
"
,,
2,6,"Be strong.
"
,,
2,6,"Daddy.
"
,,
2,6,"Stewie, I guess I'm not gonna be here
"
,,
2,6,"to see you become a man.
"
,,
2,6,"Yes. I think we all know
"
,,
2,6,"what that's going to be like.
"
,,
2,6,"A 20-minute call to Larchmont?
"
,,
2,6,"Who do we know in Larchmont?
"
,,
2,6,"My sister-in-law.
"
,,
2,6,"Yes, right. Right. Carol. Yes.
"
,,
2,6,"That's right. How is Carol?
"
,,
2,6," Brian.
"
,,
2,6," Oh, God.
"
,,
2,6," Daddy, can I come with you?
"
,,
2,6," Ask your mother.
"
,,
2,6,"No, you can't go with him!
"
,,
2,6," Oh, Peter.
"
,,
2,6," Lois.
"
,,
2,6,"Okay, that's good. Come on now.
"
,,
2,6,"Hey, Death, you got a file on me?
"
,,
2,6,"Yeah, it's in the car, I think.
"
,,
2,6,"Does it mention that I ran two weeks
"
,,
2,6,"of Junior Varsity track?
"
,,
2,6,"Let's not do this. I caught Flo Jo.
"
,,
2,6,"You don't think I can catch you?
"
,,
2,6,"My ankle!
"
,,
2,6,"Yeah, listen,
"
,,
2,6,"don't help or anything. I'm totally fine.
"
,,
2,6,"Damn Irish.
"
,,
2,6,"Yeah. That felt good,
"
,,
2,6,"dropping me on the couch like that.
"
,,
2,6,"Here's some Tylenol.
"
,,
2,6,"Great. Tylenol. I asked for Advil.
"
,,
2,6,"But, you know, whatever. That's good.
"
,,
2,6,"I got a B-plus in Health.
"
,,
2,6,"Is there anything I can do?
"
,,
2,6,"Why don't you boil some water
"
,,
2,6,"and rip up some sheets there, Einstein.
"
,,
2,6,"It's a sprained ankle.
"
,,
2,6,"I have to stay off it for a while.
"
,,
2,6,"Not here.
"
,,
2,6,"Why?
"
,,
2,6,"You tried to kill me!
"
,,
2,6,"Besides, how are we supposed
"
,,
2,6,"to explain you to Mr. Roper?
"
,,
2,6,"It's okay, Death.
"
,,
2,6,"You just worry about feeling better.
"
,,
2,6,"What the hell are you doing?
"
,,
2,6,"Peter, don't you see?
"
,,
2,6,"As long as he's here, you can't die.
"
,,
2,6,"Go on.
"
,,
2,6,"That's it.
"
,,
2,6,"Wait a minute.
"
,,
2,6,"So no matter what I do, I won't die?
"
,,
2,6,"Make yourself at home, Death.
"
,,
2,6,"I'm going out for a while.
"
,,
2,6,"Wait.
"
,,
2,6,"You can't tell anyone I'm here.
"
,,
2,6,"For if humanity discovers...
"
,,
2,6,"...l'm no longer lurking in the shadows,
"
,,
2,6,"consequences will be dire.
"
,,
2,6,"Go on.
"
,,
2,6,"That's it.
"
,,
2,6,"What the hell do you see in him?
"
,,
2,6,"What the hell do you see in him?
"
,,
2,6,"Peter, where are you going?
"
,,
2,6,"Lois, 10 minutes ago,
"
,,
2,6,"I was staring Death in the face.
"
,,
2,6,"Now that I've been given another chance...
"
,,
2,6,"...l'm gonna do the one thing
"
,,
2,6,"I've always dreamed of doing.
"
,,
2,6,"I'm gonna jump off this building.
"
,,
2,6,"Could you repeat that, please, Peter?
"
,,
2,6,"I believe I had something crazy in my ear.
"
,,
2,6,"Hold the phone.
"
,,
2,6,"You took me away from
"
,,
2,6,"a Swedish girlie-girl...
"
,,
2,6,"...and her paralyzed,
"
,,
2,6,"but trusting, cousin for this?
"
,,
2,6," $1,000 says I live.
"
,,
2,6," $1,000, huh?
"
,,
2,6," What the hell?
"
,,
2,6," Okay.
"
,,
2,6,"Look at that. I beat my loogie.
"
,,
2,6,"It's your turn, Death.
"
,,
2,6,"I know I should find this ironic,
"
,,
2,6,"but I'm just bored as hell.
"
,,
2,6,"How old is this TV?
"
,,
2,6,"You can probably get
"
,,
2,6,"the DuMont Network on this thing.
"
,,
2,6,"Peter is a good man
"
,,
2,6,"and a wonderful father.
"
,,
2,6,"Here it comes.
"
,,
2,6,"Could you please find it in your heart
"
,,
2,6,"to spare him?
"
,,
2,6,"After all, it isn't really his time.
"
,,
2,6,"What did you use
"
,,
2,6,"for this cocoa, crap?
"
,,
2,6,"If you want me to make it again...
"
,,
2,6,"Sorry, my fault.
"
,,
2,6,"I just assumed you were gonna make it
"
,,
2,6,"with milk, not crap!
"
,,
2,6,"I'll be right back.
"
,,
2,6,"I brought you a magazine.
"
,,
2,6,"Glamour, great.
"
,,
2,6,"I can learn how to please my man.
"
,,
2,6,"Go get me an Entertainment Weekly.
"
,,
2,6,"I hear it's got a great picture of me
"
,,
2,6,"sneaking up on Tom Snyder.
"
,,
2,6,"Victory is mine!
"
,,
2,6,"Wow. I should really
"
,,
2,6,"watch where I'm going.
"
,,
2,6,"What the deuce?
"
,,
2,6,"Of course!
"
,,
2,6,"It seems with Death incapacitated,
"
,,
2,6,"my matricidal efforts are futile.
"
,,
2,6,"I must do all I can to accelerate
"
,,
2,6,"his convalescence.

2,6,"That feels good.
"
,,
2,6,"Actually, kid, I kind of fell into this gig.
"
,,
2,6,"I really wanted to be a wood nymph.
"
,,
2,6,"Man, the second Dad found out,
"
,,
2,6,"he started in with the whole:
"
,,
2,6,"""I have no son. I have no son,""
"
,,
2,6,"and Mom just stood there.
"
,,
2,6,"Yes. Mothers can be quite
"
,,
2,6,"the botheration, can't they?
"
,,
2,6,"That's why we've got to get you well.
"
,,
2,6," What was that?
"
,,
2,6," Nothing!
"
,,
2,6,"Stewie, leave Death alone.
"
,,
2,6,"He's okay.
"
,,
2,6,"He reminds me a lot of me at that age.
"
,,
2,6,"I hope his teen years go better than mine.
"
,,
2,6,"Boy, talk about awkward.
"
,,
2,6,"Oh, Sandy! Sandy!
"
,,
2,6,"Sandy? Not again.
"
,,
2,6,"I'm gonna be a virgin forever.
"
,,
2,6,"Or am I?
"
,,
2,6,"Can we please talk about Peter?
"
,,
2,6,"He has so much to live for, Death.
"
,,
2,6,"He loves his children and me...
"
,,
2,6,"Okay. I'll spare his life.
"
,,
2,6,"But you owe me, if you get my drift.
"
,,
2,6,"What the hell are you doing?
"
,,
2,6,"I was talking about another fruit cup.
"
,,
2,6,"Not bad, though.
"
,,
2,6,"Peter,
"
,,
2,6,"Death just agreed to let you live.
"
,,
2,6,"Oh, man. This really is my night.
"
,,
2,6,"I get to live, and I'm on TV.
"
,,
2,6,"Our top story tonight,
"
,,
2,6,"the rules of death no longer apply.
"
,,
2,6,"That's right, Tom.
"
,,
2,6,"Our own Asian reporter, Trisha Takanawa,
"
,,
2,6,"filed this report, all by herself!
"
,,
2,6,"I'm here with Peter Griffin,
"
,,
2,6,"the man who claims he withstood...
"
,,
2,6,"...a barrage of bullets and did not die.
"
,,
2,6,"Peter, are you saying
"
,,
2,6,"that if I shoot you in the head...
"
,,
2,6,"...with this Channel 5 pistol,
"
,,
2,6,"you'll be completely unharmed?
"
,,
2,6,"Why don't you give it a shot?
"
,,
2,6,"Okay, here goes.
"
,,
2,6,"What have I done?
"
,,
2,6,"You're awful.
"
,,
2,6," Fascinating story, Tom.
"
,,
2,6," It sure is, Diane.
"
,,
2,6,"And since the laws of death
"
,,
2,6,"no longer apply, I can do this.
"
,,
2,6,"That's right, Tom.
"
,,
2,6,"And now it's time for sports.
"
,,
2,6,"The whole world is laughing
"
,,
2,6,"at me. This is high school all over again.
"
,,
2,6,"Well, I'll show them! I'll show all of them!
"
,,
2,6,"Oh, my God, that hurts!
"
,,
2,6,"You're not killing anyone tonight, mister!
"
,,
2,6,"Not on that ankle.
"
,,
2,6,"This is all your fault.
"
,,
2,6,"And there's only one solution.
"
,,
2,6,"You have to go out there and do my job.
"
,,
2,6,"You have to be Death!
"
,,
2,6,"Boy, this doesn't leave much
"
,,
2,6,"to the imagination.
"
,,
2,6,"Death, there is no way
"
,,
2,6,"Peter can do your job.
"
,,
2,6,"He could never kill anyone.
"
,,
2,6,"Yeah! I've thought about it,
"
,,
2,6,"like in church and stuff...
"
,,
2,6,"...but I don't think I could ever do
"
,,
2,6,"what you do.
"
,,
2,6,"So you're better than me?
"
,,
2,6,"I'm tired of always being the bad guy.
"
,,
2,6,"What I do has to be done.
"
,,
2,6,"He's right. You've disturbed
"
,,
2,6,"the natural order.
"
,,
2,6,"People need to be able to die.
"
,,
2,6,"No!
"
,,
2,6," Actually, I think I'm gonna be okay.
"
,,
2,6," Oh, Jack.
"
,,
2,6,"Now we can get married
"
,,
2,6,"and everything you promised.
"
,,
2,6,"Yeah, about that...
"
,,
2,6,"...I was pretty sure I was gonna die...
"
,,
2,6,"...because there's this girl in New York,
"
,,
2,6,"and it's getting kind of serious.
"
,,
2,6,"But thanks for letting me draw you naked.
"
,,
2,6,"I still can't believe you let me do that!
"
,,
2,6,"You're saying the only way to make
"
,,
2,6,"the world right is for me to kill someone?
"
,,
2,6,"You could kill Lois.
"
,,
2,6,"No. One death isn't gonna do it.
"
,,
2,6,"You have to do something that will
"
,,
2,6,"get everyone's attention, something huge.
"
,,
2,6,"How about if you blow up the earth?
"
,,
2,6,"Too huge.
"
,,
2,6,"But you're thinking. I like that.
"
,,
2,6,"You could kill any girls
"
,,
2,6,"who are prettier than me.
"
,,
2,6,"That would just leave England.
"
,,
2,6,"Wait. I have it.
"
,,
2,6,"I'm a genius.
"
,,
2,6,"You'll kill the kids from Dawson's Creek!
"
,,
2,6,"I knew it! As soon as that show
"
,,
2,6,"came on the air, I said:
"
,,
2,6,"""I'm gonna be the one
"
,,
2,6,"who has to kill these kids.""
"
,,
2,6,"It's true. He did say it.
"
,,
2,6,"Hot, young celebrities.
"
,,
2,6,"It's perfect!
"
,,
2,6,"The kids are on their way to LA
"
,,
2,6,"to renegotiate their contracts.
"
,,
2,6,"But their plane is gonna be making
"
,,
2,6,"a little stopover in Rhode Island.
"
,,
2,6,"If you go now, you'll catch them.
"
,,
2,6,"No way.
"
,,
2,6,"I'm not doing your dirty work.
"
,,
2,6,"There's no way I'm getting on that plane.
"
,,
2,6,"Absolutely no way, and that's final.
"
,,
2,6,"See? I'm still here.
"
,,
2,6,"There's nothing you can say
"
,,
2,6,"that'll change my mind.
"
,,
2,6,"You kill them, or I kill you.
"
,,
2,6,"Crap!
"
,,
2,6,"Nice plant.
"
,,
2,6,"Note to self, do not go to the bathroom.
"
,,
2,6,"James,
"
,,
2,6,"your last movie killed at the box office.
"
,,
2,6,"Your Q-rating's through the roof.
"
,,
2,6,"It's time we ditched the WB
"
,,
2,6,"and concentrate on features.
"
,,
2,6,"I don't know who you are,
"
,,
2,6,"but just because you're sitting...
"
,,
2,6,"...across from me doesn't mean
"
,,
2,6,"you can give me career advice.
"
,,
2,6," Will you sign my ass?
"
,,
2,6," You have a pen?
"
,,
2,6,"Hello, Death?
"
,,
2,6,"Guess where I'm calling from?
"
,,
2,6,"A plane!
"
,,
2,6,"That's great.
"
,,
2,6,"Are those kids on board?
"
,,
2,6,"Yeah.
"
,,
2,6,"About that,
"
,,
2,6,"I don't think I can go through with it.
"
,,
2,6,"Peter, listen, without death,
"
,,
2,6,"the world would be a terrible place.
"
,,
2,6,"Imagine a world
"
,,
2,6,"where Hitler was still alive.
"
,,
2,6,"Today on Hitler,
"
,,
2,6,"we'll be talking with Christian Slater.
"
,,
2,6,"Now, they tell me in your next movie,
"
,,
2,6,"we get to see your butt.
"
,,
2,6,"Yes, you do.
"
,,
2,6,"Can we see it right now?
"
,,
2,6,"All right.
"
,,
2,6,"He's going to do it!
"
,,
2,6,"If you're going to be in L.A.
"
,,
2,6,"And would like tickets to Hitler...
"
,,
2,6,"...call 213-du werdest
"
,,
2,6,"eine Krankenschwester brauchen!
"
,,
2,6,"Peter, all you gotta do is sit there.
"
,,
2,6,"The plane is gonna crash in LA.
"
,,
2,6,"Pilot error. Big mess. Everybody dies.
"
,,
2,6,"Jeez, everybody?
"
,,
2,6,"Except you.
"
,,
2,6,"Hold on, I'm getting another call. Brenda?
"
,,
2,6,"It's still me.
"
,,
2,6,"Brenda?
"
,,
2,6,"Yes? Just kidding, it's still me.
"
,,
2,6,"We now begin our final approach
"
,,
2,6,"into Los Angeles International.
"
,,
2,6,"If you look out the window,
"
,,
2,6,"you'll see the San Fernando Valley...
"
,,
2,6,"...where my brother Gary makes
"
,,
2,6,"a very nice living directing porn.
"
,,
2,6,"We'll be on the ground in 10 minutes.
"
,,
2,6,"""We like being alive,
"
,,
2,6,"we like being alive
"
,,
2,6,"""We like being, oh, we like being,
"
,,
2,6,"oh, we like being alive""
"
,,
2,6,"I guess it's their time.
"
,,
2,6,"Boy, for a teacher,
"
,,
2,6,"you sure make love good.
"
,,
2,6,"Actually, it's ""well,"" Pacey.
"
,,
2,6,"You mean to say, I make love ""well.""
"
,,
2,6," You're good to go again, right?
"
,,
2,6," Yeah.
"
,,
2,6,"Peter? Hello? Peter,
"
,,
2,6,"are you there? I can hear you breathing?
"
,,
2,6,"Yeah, I'm here. And you can forget it.
"
,,
2,6,"I've changed my mind.
"
,,
2,6,"I don't care if you do kill me,
"
,,
2,6,"I'm not gonna kill those kids.
"
,,
2,6,"If they die, I'll have nothing
"
,,
2,6,"to watch on Wednesdays...
"
,,
2,6,"...other than the fine programs on Fox.
"
,,
2,6,"Open up in there!
"
,,
2,6,"What are you doing? You're not a pilot.
"
,,
2,6,"I know every pilot in the world!
"
,,
2,6,"I'm here to keep you from making an error.
"
,,
2,6,"A pilot error.
"
,,
2,6,"Jeez, I probably should've worn mittens!
"
,,
2,6,"Nice going, fat...
"
,,
2,6,"I was just trying to save your lives.
"
,,
2,6,"But now you're all gonna die.
"
,,
2,6," No one can land this plane.
"
,,
2,6," I can.
"
,,
2,6,"Thank God! It's Karen Black!
"
,,
2,6,"She landed a busted plane in Airport '75?
"
,,
2,6,"It was a movie in the '70s.
"
,,
2,6,"You damn kids with your music.
"
,,
2,6,"Both of the pilots were killed.
"
,,
2,6,"Fortunately for the other passengers,
"
,,
2,6,"actress Karen Black...
"
,,
2,6,"...star of such films as Nashville
"
,,
2,6,"and Five Easy Pieces, was on board.
"
,,
2,6,"Hats off to Miss Black for proving
"
,,
2,6,"once again that, given the opportunity...
"
,,
2,6,"...actresses over 50 can land large aircraft.
"
,,
2,6,"Karen Black. What an obscure reference!
"
,,
2,6,"What the hell? I told you to waste
"
,,
2,6,"the Dawson's Creek kids.
"
,,
2,6,"You're missing
"
,,
2,6,"the important thing here.
"
,,
2,6,"You said you wanted everyone to know
"
,,
2,6,"the rules of death apply.
"
,,
2,6,"Now the whole world does.
"
,,
2,6,"I guess so.
"
,,
2,6,"My ankle's starting to feel better.
"
,,
2,6,"I should probably get out of your hair.
"
,,
2,6,"But you just got here!
"
,,
2,6,"We can stay in touch, can't we?
"
,,
2,6,"What's your e-mail?
"
,,
2,6,"Mine is ""loismustdie,"" all one word,
"
,,
2,6,"""@yahoo.com.""
"
,,
2,6,"Wait a second. Death?
"
,,
2,6,"I used to fear you,
"
,,
2,6,"but now I'm glad we met.
"
,,
2,6,"Because you've given me a great gift.
"
,,
2,6,"The complete Boz Scaggs.
"
,,
2,6,"How did you know?
"
,,
2,6,"I just had a feeling.
"
,,
2,6,"We're gonna miss you, Death.
"
,,
2,6,"Don't worry.
"
,,
2,6,"I'll be back really, really soon.
"
,,
2,6,"Is he joking?
"
,,
2,6,"Okay, see you later.
"
,,
2,7,"""It seems today that all you see
"
,,
2,7,"""is violence in movies and sex on TV

2,7,"""He's a family guy""
"
,,
2,7,"It was a moving scene today
"
,,
2,7,"at Hatch Pond...
"
,,
2,7,"...as six members of the Pawtucket
"
,,
2,7,"fire department struggled valiantly...
"
,,
2,7,"...to save a fish's life
"
,,
2,7,"trapped under the frozen ice.
"
,,
2,7,"Rescue workers got the fish
"
,,
2,7,"out of the water...
"
,,
2,7,"...but unfortunately it died shortly after.
"
,,
2,7,"Diane?
"
,,
2,7,"Tom, another life
"
,,
2,7,"was tragically cut short today.
"
,,
2,7,"Robert Kimble, founder of a local theater
"
,,
2,7,"group known as the Quahog Players...
"

2,7,"...passed away this afternoon.
"

2,7,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
2,7,"Kimble was a hands-on director who
"

2,7,"""La la la la la, Miss Saigon""
"
,,
2,7,"Yes, I just heard. It's so sad.
"
,,
2,7,"Really?
"
,,
2,7,"They want me to be the new
"
,,
2,7,"artistic director of the Quahog Players!
"
,,
2,7," All right, Mom!
"
,,
2,7," Are you gonna do it?
"
,,
2,7,"I don't know. It's such a big responsibility.
"
,,
2,7,"I need a moment to think.
"
,,
2,7,"Okay, I'll do it.
"
,,
2,7,"This just in. Lois Griffin is named the new
"
,,
2,7,"artistic director of the Quahog Players.
"
,,
2,7,"All those years of paying my dues
"
,,
2,7,"as musical director...
"
,,
2,7,"...under that old hack have finally paid off.
"
,,
2,7,"Lois, congratulations.
"
,,
2,7,"Our little theater group finally has
"
,,
2,7,"a committed visionary at its helm.
"
,,
2,7,"And such an attractive one.
"
,,
2,7,"Brian, you'll have to audition
"
,,
2,7,"just like everyone else.
"
,,
2,7,"God, of course. I...
"
,,
2,7,"You didn't think... You thought I was...
"
,,
2,7,"Lois!
"
,,
2,7," I can paint scenery.
"
,,
2,7," Can I be in the show, Mom?
"
,,
2,7,"Yes, you can be the dumpy teenager
"
,,
2,7,"who stays backstage and cries...
"
,,
2,7,"...because nobody finds her attractive.
"
,,
2,7," Hey, you guys.
"
,,
2,7," Peter, guess what? I am gonna...
"
,,
2,7,"Me first! Mr. Weed said
"
,,
2,7,"whoever comes up with the best idea...
"
,,
2,7,"...for the big Christmas toy this year
"
,,
2,7,"gets a huge bonus.
"
,,
2,7,"Hey, Dad,
"
,,
2,7,"why don't you invent the Frisbee?
"
,,
2,7,"That's an awesome toy.
"
,,
2,7," It's already been invented.
"
,,
2,7," Then how come I never heard of it?
"
,,
2,7,"This is my chance to prove
"
,,
2,7,"how valuable I am to the company!
"
,,
2,7,"Sorry, Lois. What's your news?
"
,,
2,7,"Well, I...
"
,,
2,7,"Mr. Weed,
"
,,
2,7,"distinguished members of the board...
"
,,
2,7,"...may I present this year's hottest toy...
"
,,
2,7,"...Mr. Zucchini Head.
"
,,
2,7,"He's got stupid cool hip-hop style
"
,,
2,7,"with his little hat and his Doc Martens.
"
,,
2,7,"Thank you, Peter, that's enough.
"
,,
2,7,"Wait. This is the best part! He dances!
"
,,
2,7,"I've seen enough.
"
,,
2,7,"Inappropriate.
"
,,
2,7,"I haven't had sex in ages.
"
,,
2,7,"Gentlemen,
"
,,
2,7,"I apologize for wasting your time.
"
,,
2,7,"Peter is an adequate
"
,,
2,7,"assembly-line worker...
"
,,
2,7,"...but you'll be happy to know
"
,,
2,7,"our company does not pay him to think.
"
,,
2,7,"I'll take this.
"
,,
2,7,"No calls.
"
,,
2,7,"Come on, kids!
"
,,
2,7,"The director can't be late for the auditions.
"
,,
2,7,"You should've heard them laughing at me.
"
,,
2,7,"I got great ideas, but they look at me,
"
,,
2,7,"and all they see is a loser.
"
,,
2,7,"Except that guy with the lazy eye.
"
,,
2,7,"He sees a loser and the snack machine.
"
,,
2,7,"Peter, a lot of creative people
"
,,
2,7,"had mindless jobs.
"
,,
2,7,"Michelangelo worked in a marble quarry.
"
,,
2,7,"Herman Melville was a customs agent.
"
,,
2,7,"Albert Einstein
"
,,
2,7,"worked for the patent office.
"
,,
2,7,"And what is it you want to patent,
"
,,
2,7,"Herr Smith?
"
,,
2,7,"I call it ""Smith's Theory of Relativity.""
"
,,
2,7," Hey, look at this.
"
,,
2,7," What?
"
,,
2,7,"I think Lois is saying that...
"
,,
2,7,"...you have to find a way
"
,,
2,7,"to express yourself creatively.
"
,,
2,7,"For example, Chris has his drawing,
"
,,
2,7,"Meg does her birdcalls, I sing beautifully.
"
,,
2,7,"So I've heard.
"
,,
2,7,"And Lois has her theater group.
"
,,
2,7,"Yes. And for my first production,
"
,,
2,7,"I've chosen The King and I.
"
,,
2,7,"It's a wonderful story
"
,,
2,7,"about a loving, patient woman...
"
,,
2,7,"...who introduces culture and civility
"
,,
2,7,"to a barbaric, patriarchal...
"
,,
2,7,"Peter, please don't wipe your nose
"
,,
2,7,"on the couch.
"
,,
2,7,"Look, I have to go.
"
,,
2,7,"Part of being creative is figuring out
"
,,
2,7,"what you're good at.
"
,,
2,7,"I know you can do it
"
,,
2,7,"if you put your mind to it.
"
,,
2,7,"You're right. Man was meant to create.
"
,,
2,7,"That's why God invented Shrinky Dinks.
"
,,
2,7,"It works! Look how tiny they are!
"
,,
2,7,"""Oh, no not in springtime
"
,,
2,7,"""summer, winter, or fall
"
,,
2,7,"""No, never would I leave you
"
,,
2,7,"""at all""
"
,,
2,7,"Bravo!
"
,,
2,7,"Brian, that was beautiful!
"
,,
2,7,"Thank you!
"
,,
2,7,"No, thank you.
"
,,
2,7,"And that note you gave me, ""louder,""
"
,,
2,7,"I was thinking that, and then you said it.
"
,,
2,7,"You're so intuitive. It's a pleasure...
"
,,
2,7,"Okay. Next!
"
,,
2,7,"Stewie, do you want to try out
"
,,
2,7,"for Mommy's play?
"
,,
2,7,"""Now is the winter of our discontent
"
,,
2,7,"made glorious summer by this sun of York.
"
,,

2,7,"Hey, can somebody give me a hand
"
,,
2,7,"with all this talent?
"
,,
2,7,"Peter, what are you doing here?
"
,,
2,7,"Well, Lois, I tried finding my creativity,
"
,,
2,7,"like you said.
"
,,
2,7,"First I took an art class.
"
,,
2,7,"Am I supposed to draw the penis?
"
,,
2,7,"Then I tried sculpting.
"
,,
2,7,"Am I supposed to sculpt the penis?
"
,,
2,7,"Then I tried music.
"
,,
2,7,"Am I supposed to conduct with my penis?
"
,,
2,7,"I started to think
"
,,
2,7,"there was nothing I'd be good at.
"
,,
2,7,"But then I realized that this is it.
"
,,
2,7,"Lois, my penis belongs on stage.
"
,,
2,7,"Wait, Peter, everyone has to audition.
"
,,
2,7,"You know, sing, dance.
"
,,
2,7,"I get it.
"
,,
2,7,"Hello, everybody.
"
,,
2,7,"This is just a formality,
"
,,
2,7,"since I happen to be doing the director.
"
,,
2,7,"Five, six, seven, eight.
"
,,
2,7,"""Marshall, Will, and Holly,

"
,,
2,7,"Before I post the cast list...
"
,,
2,7,"...my choreographer and I
"
,,
2,7,"want to thank everyone for auditioning.
"
,,
2,7," You were all great.
"
,,
2,7," Weren't they?
"
,,
2,7,"I only wish the show was called
"
,,
2,7,"The King and Us...
"
,,
2,7,"...so I could cast you all.
"
,,
2,7,"Anna! Baby, baby! I'm a star!
"
,,
2,7,"Wow. I've never hugged a celebrity before.
"
,,
2,7,"Except for Pearl Bailey
"
,,
2,7,"at a book signing once...
"
,,
2,7,"...but then we later found out
"
,,
2,7,"it wasn't actually her.
"
,,
2,7,"Siamese baby?
"
,,
2,7,"Stewie Griffin does not play bit parts!
"
,,
2,7,"You wanted a bigger part,
"
,,
2,7,"didn't you, sweetie?
"
,,
2,7,"To hell with you!
"
,,
2,7,"Perhaps I'll skip the stage
"
,,
2,7,"and go directly to films!
"
,,
2,7," Hello.
"
,,
2,7," What is that on your ear?
"
,,
2,7,"Is that hair gel?
"
,,
2,7," Yeah.
"
,,
2,7," Great, 'cause I could use some.
"
,,
2,7," No, don't!
"
,,
2,7," I just ran out.
"
,,
2,7,"Man! Chorus! Shoot, what a gyp!
"
,,
2,7,"The King of Siam? Why,
"
,,
2,7,"that's the lead! This is so unexpected!
"
,,
2,7,"Hey, shut up!
"
,,
2,7,"The King of Siam? Why, that's the lead!
"
,,
2,7,"Lois, I think you made a mistake.
"
,,
2,7,"I'm not ""The King.""
"
,,
2,7,"I'm not ""I,"" I'm not anybody.
"
,,
2,7," So, what? I had sex with you for nothing?
"
,,
2,7," No, Peter, I...
"
,,
2,7,"It's just that directing this show
"
,,
2,7,"is a big opportunity for me...
"
,,
2,7,"...and I don't want anything to ruin it.
"
,,
2,7," Ruin it?
"
,,
2,7," Yes.
"
,,
2,7,"By not using you to your full potential.
"
,,
2,7,"You have too much talent for the stage.
"
,,
2,7,"You should...
"
,,
2,7,"You should be a producer.
"
,,
2,7,"A producer? Gee, I don't know.
"
,,
2,7,"Great news, Edgar Bronfman, Jr.
"
,,
2,7,"We made the deal.
"
,,
2,7,"We're richer and more powerful than ever!
"
,,
2,7,"I'm the king of the...
"
,,
2,7,"Damn it!
"
,,
2,7,"I love Mexicans. I'll do it!
"
,,
2,7,"Hang on, hang on!
"
,,
2,7,"You overextended the pli!
"
,,
2,7,"You screwed it all up.
"
,,
2,7,"Let me show you again.
"
,,
2,7,"Okay, boys! Let's do it!
"
,,
2,7,"And one, two, three.
"
,,
2,7,"And just like this.
"
,,
2,7,"And watch my feet. And one, two, three.
"
,,
2,7,"Peter, Chris says you told him
"
,,
2,7,"to build a set for the North Pole.
"
,,
2,7,"Yeah, that's where Anna goes
"
,,
2,7,"to talk with her best friend, a penguin.
"
,,
2,7,"There is no talking penguin
"
,,
2,7,"in The King and I.
"
,,
2,7,"There is in
"
,,
2,7,"""Peter Griffin presents The King and I.""
"
,,
2,7,"What?
"
,,
2,7,"Now we gotta think of
"
,,
2,7,"some funny stuff for him to say.
"
,,
2,7,"Peter, the director decides
"
,,
2,7,"whether or not to add a character.
"
,,
2,7,"You're the producer, remember?
"
,,
2,7,"What am I supposed to do
"
,,
2,7,"with all my great ideas?
"
,,
2,7,"Put 'em in a tub
"
,,
2,7,"and clean myself with them?
"
,,
2,7,"'Cause that's what soap is for, Lois.
"
,,
2,7,"Good producers put their ideas to work
"
,,
2,7,"outside the theater.
"
,,
2,7,"It's your job to make sure
"
,,
2,7,"we sell every seat in this house.
"
,,
2,7," And that's creative?
"
,,
2,7," Is it?
"
,,
2,7,"Well, it's just
"
,,
2,7,"the most creative job there is.
"
,,
2,7,"Don't you worry, Lois. I'll get the word out.
"
,,
2,7,"I'll tell two friends,
"
,,
2,7,"and they'll tell two friends...
"
,,
2,7,"...and that's, like, 10 people right there.
"
,,
2,7,"Hey, I recognize you from the television.
"
,,
2,7,"You're Tom Tucker. I bet you can do this.
"
,,
2,7,"Excuse me?
"
,,
2,7,"You. Get out of here!
"
,,
2,7,"Get out of here! Go on, get out of here!
"
,,
2,7," Wow! Diane Simmons!
"
,,
2,7," You don't look anything like the ad.
"
,,
2,7," You better be huge.
"
,,
2,7," No, I'm Peter Griffin, producer.
"
,,
2,7,"I'm presenting
"
,,
2,7,"""Peter Griffin presents The King and l""...
"
,,
2,7,"...a Peter Griffin production,
"
,,
2,7,"and I'm giving you the exclusive story.
"
,,
2,7,"Look, pal, some two-bit
"
,,
2,7,"community theater production isn't news.
"
,,
2,7,"Who's the star?
"
,,
2,7,"For that matter, who the hell are you,
"
,,
2,7,"and why should I give a damn?
"
,,
2,7,"Wow, I'm being interviewed
"
,,
2,7,"by Diane Simmons!
"
,,
2,7,"Well, Lois,
"
,,
2,7,"you told me to produce, and I did.
"
,,
2,7,"I got us a story on the 11:00 news.
"
,,
2,7," Really?
"
,,
2,7," Peter.
"
,,
2,7,"Our top story tonight.
"
,,
2,7,"I will be playing the role of Anna...
"
,,
2,7,"...in the Quahog Players production
"
,,
2,7,"of The King and I.
"
,,
2,7," Tom?
"
,,
2,7," Thanks, Diane.
"
,,
2,7,"In other news, I'm not going to the play
"
,,
2,7,"because I'm sure it'll be lousy.
"
,,
2,7,"I'm getting late word
"
,,
2,7,"that you're a petty, jealous, closet case.
"
,,
2,7,"Bit of breaking news. We now go live
"
,,
2,7,"to Diane being a bitch. Diane?
"
,,
2,7,"But Loretta's playing Anna,
"
,,
2,7,"and she's doing a great job.
"
,,
2,7,"Loretta's a nobody.
"
,,
2,7,"Diane Simmons is a star.
"
,,
2,7,"You wanted me to sell tickets, right?
"
,,
2,7,"People who've never been in a theater
"
,,
2,7,"will come see Diane Simmons.
"
,,
2,7,"I don't know, Peter, she's a news reporter.
"
,,
2,7,"Some of our greatest actors
"
,,
2,7,"started in news, like Sean Penn.
"
,,
2,7,"Today's weather calls for breezy skies
"
,,
2,7,"and sun, and there's gonna be a...
"
,,
2,7,"Get that camera out of my face!
"
,,
2,7,"Hey, everybody, here's our star!
"
,,
2,7,"This is so awkward.
"
,,
2,7,"You all know my name,
"
,,
2,7,"and I've never heard of any of you.
"
,,
2,7," You ever acted before, honey?
"
,,
2,7," I did an independent film in college.
"
,,
2,7,"Let's start with the scene where
"
,,
2,7,"Lady Thiang begs Anna to comfort the king.
"
,,
2,7," Are you playing Lady Thiang?
"
,,
2,7," I was supposed to be Anna.
"
,,
2,7,"They did an all-you-people version
"
,,
2,7,"of Hello, Dolly that was very successful.
"
,,
2,7,"Okay, let's go from the top of Scene 7.
"
,,
2,7,"Action!
"
,,
2,7,"""Oh, Mrs. Anna, the king needs you.
"
,,
2,7,"You must go to him.
"
,,
2,7,"""Lady Thiang, if he needs me,
"
,,
2,7,"truly needs me, I will go to him.""
"
,,
2,7,"Cut! All wrong! No good!
"
,,
2,7,"Peter, what are you doing?
"
,,
2,7,"She was wonderful.
"
,,
2,7,"My ass.
"
,,
2,7,"Besides, I'm the director.
"
,,
2,7,"It just doesn't feel real, you know?
"
,,
2,7,"Anna and Miss Thing both love
"
,,
2,7,"the king, right?
"
,,
2,7,"On Springer yesterday,
"
,,
2,7,"they had ""I won't share my husband""...
"
,,
2,7,"...and these two women bitch-slapped
"
,,
2,7,"each other. The crowd went nuts.
"
,,
2,7," Loretta, why don't you try slapping Diane?
"
,,
2,7," I think I can do that.
"
,,
2,7,"Wait a minute.
"
,,
2,7,"Nobody's slapping anybody.
"
,,
2,7,"This is Rodgers and Hammerstein,
"
,,
2,7,"not trash TV!
"
,,
2,7,"I think Peter may be onto something.
"
,,
2,7,"Springer is one of our station's
"
,,
2,7,"highest-rated shows.
"
,,
2,7," I don't know.
"
,,
2,7," I thought you wanted to do a good show?
"
,,
2,7," I don't know.
"
,,
2,7," I thought you wanted to do a good show?
"
,,
2,7,"If you want to do a bad show,
"
,,
2,7,"why don't we just do Rent?
"
,,
2,7,"I guess we can try that...
"
,,
2,7," Action!
"
,,
2,7,"Come on, Lois. Those hoop skirts
"
,,
2,7,"make Diane look a little hippie, you know?
"
,,
2,7,"I thought we could dress her
"
,,
2,7,"in a pair of sequined capri pants.
"
,,
2,7,"They didn't have capri pants in the 1860s.
"
,,
2,7,"They did now!
"
,,
2,7,"You! You are the worst thing
"
,,
2,7,"to happen to musical theater...
"
,,
2,7,"...since Andrew Lloyd Webber!
"
,,
2,7,"And you! I just plain don't like you!
"
,,
2,7,"What's going on?
"
,,
2,7,"We're just having a little pow-wow
"
,,
2,7,"to discuss my latest changes.
"
,,
2,7,"What changes?
"
,,
2,7,"The Siamese children. How about this?
"
,,
2,7,"They're not children.
"
,,
2,7,"They're aliens!
"
,,
2,7,"That was great.
"
,,
2,7,"On the money.
"
,,
2,7,"Isn't he brilliant?
"
,,
2,7,"No! He's not brilliant!
"
,,
2,7,"Rodgers and Hammerstein were brilliant!
"
,,
2,7,"And I want to do the show they wrote!
"
,,
2,7,"We're not making any more changes!
"
,,
2,7,"We sold out!
"
,,
2,7,"Yeah. The whole town's talking
"
,,
2,7,"about your show, Dad!
"
,,
2,7,"Your show? Peter, this is my show!
"
,,
2,7,"What's the big deal?
"
,,
2,7,"You wanted to sell out, and we did.
"
,,
2,7,"I am through selling out.
"
,,
2,7,"I took this job because
"
,,
2,7,"I wanted to create something beautiful...
"
,,
2,7,"...and you've completely destroyed that!
"
,,
2,7,"You want to be the director? Fine! I quit!
"
,,
2,7,"Me, direct?
"
,,
2,7,"I don't know what to say, except,
"
,,
2,7,"""I'm the king of the...""
"
,,
2,7,"Morning, theater fans!
"
,,
2,7,"Good morning, Peter.
"
,,
2,7,"I made your favorite breakfast.
"
,,
2,7," What the hell is this?
"
,,
2,7," French toast.
"
,,
2,7,"I just made a few creative changes
"
,,
2,7,"to the recipe.
"
,,
2,7,"I think it's a lot better now.
"
,,
2,7,"Lois, if this is your idea of a joke,
"
,,
2,7,"you must write for Leno.
"
,,
2,7,"It is so fashionable to take a shot
"
,,
2,7,"at Jay Leno.
"
,,
2,7,"Look, the fact is the man is out there
"
,,
2,7,"every bloody night with fresh material...
"
,,
2,7,"...and he's charming.
"
,,
2,7,"Face it, you're just jealous because
"
,,
2,7,"people like my ideas better than yours.
"
,,
2,7,"I don't care
"
,,
2,7,"if the whole world loves your ideas.
"
,,
2,7,"That doesn't make them good.
"
,,
2,7,"I was trying to make art.
"
,,
2,7,"Art-schmart.
"
,,
2,7,"Put enough monkeys in a room
"
,,
2,7,"with a typewriter...
"
,,
2,7,"...they'll produce Shakespeare.
"
,,
2,7,"Let's see.
"
,,
2,7,"""A something by any other name...""
"
,,
2,7," ""Carnation,"" ""peony.""
"
,,
2,7," No, they did that on last week's Marlowe.
"
,,
2,7," What about ""daisy""?
"
,,
2,7," ""Chrysanthemum""!
"
,,
2,7," ""Iris,"" ""rose""? What about ""rose""?
"
,,
2,7," Did you say ""rose""?
"
,,
2,7," Yeah, ""rose.""
"
,,
2,7," ""Rose"" is good!
"
,,
2,7," ""A rose by any other name."" That works.
"
,,
2,7," I like that a lot.
"
,,
2,7," Moving on.
"
,,
2,7," What about ""tulip""?
"
,,
2,7,"""Rose"" is fine. Moving on.
"
,,
2,7,"Peter, you've never done a creative thing
"
,,
2,7,"in your life!
"
,,
2,7,"That's not true.
"
,,
2,7,"I wrote Bonfire of the Vanities.
"
,,
2,7,"No, you didn't.
"
,,
2,7,"You win this round, Lois.
"
,,
2,7,"You're not being creative.
"
,,
2,7,"You're just destroying a wonderful show.
"
,,
2,7,"I have more creativity in my whole body
"
,,
2,7,"than most people do before 9:00 a.m.
"
,,
2,7,"The only thing you create before 9:00 a. M...
"
,,
2,7,"...is exactly what you've turned
"
,,
2,7,"my show into.
"
,,
2,7,"I think my work will speak for itself.
"
,,
2,7,"I just got that. A poop joke?
"
,,
2,7,"That's real creative, Lois.
"
,,
2,7,"Okay, let's run this scene again.
"
,,
2,7,"Remember, Diane, you're playing Anna,
"
,,
2,7,"a steel-town girl on a Saturday night...
"
,,
2,7,"...looking for the fight of her life.
"
,,
2,7," Where does it say that?
"
,,
2,7," In my noodle.
"
,,
2,7,"Okay, places. And action!
"
,,
2,7,"Stop! All wrong! All wrong!
"
,,
2,7,"God, send me dancers.
"
,,
2,7,"We've been rehearsing for hours.
"
,,
2,7,"I'm exhausted!
"
,,
2,7,"I'm sorry,
"
,,
2,7,"but we open this show in three hours...
"
,,
2,7,"...and I don't think we're ready!
"
,,
2,7,"No, we're not!
"
,,
2,7,"You keep changing everything!
"
,,
2,7,"You bet I do! Because theater is alive.
"
,,
2,7,"It's a living, breathing creature
"
,,
2,7,"with wants and needs...
"
,,
2,7,"...and you're not man enough
"
,,
2,7,"to satisfy her!
"
,,
2,7," I can't work this way. I quit!
"
,,
2,7," Fine.
"
,,
2,7," We can't do The King and I without Anna.
"
,,
2,7," Yeah. This is a real snafu.
"
,,
2,7,"We don't need Diane Simmons.
"
,,
2,7,"We've had someone better all along.
"
,,
2,7,"Someone radiant and sassy...
"
,,
2,7,"...with the soul and passion
"
,,
2,7,"that can only come...
"
,,
2,7,"...from hundreds of years
"
,,
2,7,"of black oppression.
"
,,
2,7,"Thank you, Peter. I'll do it.
"
,,
2,7,"Get over yourself. I was talking about me.
"
,,
2,7,"Su-su-sudio. Su-su-sudio.
"
,,
2,7,"Two minutes, everybody.
"
,,
2,7,"Jeez, full house.
"
,,
2,7,"Look who came crawling back.
"
,,
2,7,"Peter, have you seen my wheelchair?
"
,,
2,7,"I don't get it, Mom.
"
,,
2,7,"If you're mad at Dad for wrecking your
"
,,
2,7,"show, why'd you come to opening night?
"
,,
2,7,"I came because I love the theater.
"
,,
2,7,"If I just came here to enjoy
"
,,
2,7,"watching your father be humiliated...
"
,,
2,7,"...when this asinine spectacle of his
"
,,
2,7,"is ridiculed by everyone in town...
"
,,
2,7,"...what kind of person would I be?
"
,,
2,7,"A bitch.
"
,,
2,7,"Siam, 2015 AD.
"
,,
2,7,"The city lies in ruins
"
,,
2,7,"after the ninth nuclear World War.
"
,,
2,7,"It is a grim future with lots of explosions
"
,,
2,7,"and partial nudity.
"
,,
2,7,"A future where an oppressive new king
"
,,
2,7,"has seized power.

2,7,"Only one man can stop him.

2,7,"No, one machine.

2,7,"and free this land from your tyranny.

2,7,"Let me introduce my Siamese children.

2,7,"I will not be swayed by your attempts

2,7,"to confuse my programming...

2,7," We're a hit.
"

2,7,"Man, what a night.
"

2,7,"I got to see my ideas come to life.
"

2,7,"It's the greatest feeling in the world.
"

2,7," Yeah, I bet it is.
"

2,7," And it's all thanks to you.

2,7,"I never would've discovered

2,7,"Yeah, Lois,
"

2,7,"sorry I took your show away from you...
"

2,7,"...but I'll do whatever it takes to make sure

2,7,"you get your chance next year.

2,7,"It'll be ""Peter Griffin presents

2,7," Okay, honey?
"
,,
2,7," Deal.
"
,,
2,7,"Were you there when I farted?
"
,,
2,8,"It seems today that all you see
"

2,8,"Is violence in movies and sex on TV
"

2,8,"But where are those
"

2,8,"good old-fashioned values

2,8,"He's a family guy
"
,,
2,8,"Boy, that lotion sure feels good.
"
,,
2,8," Sure is hot.
"
,,
2,8," And it just got hotter.
"
,,
2,8,"Here. Now let me do you.
"
,,
2,8,"Pawtucket Patriot beer. If you buy it,
"
,,
2,8,"hot women will have sex in your back yard.
"
,,
2,8,"Typical male fantasy! Women drinking beer!
"
,,
2,8,"I guarantee you a man made that commercial.
"
,,
2,8,"Of course a man made it. It's a commercial,
"
,,
2,8,"Lois, not a delicious Thanksgiving dinner.
"
,,
2,8,"Dad, we won a boat! We won a boat! Ha-ha!
"
,,
2,8,"Holy crap! We did!
"
,,
2,8,"We won a free freakin' boat!
"
,,
2,8,"Dad, nobody gives things away for free.
"
,,
2,8,"I know plenty of people
"
,,
2,8,"who give things away.
"
,,
2,8,"I'll take it.
"
,,
2,8,"Hello, China? I have something
"
,,
2,8,"you may want, but it's gonna cost you.
"
,,
2,8,"That's right. All the tea.
"
,,
2,8,"I knew there was a catch. You have to sit
"
,,
2,8,"through an awful time-share presentation.
"
,,
2,8,"A small price to pay. I'm gonna be the first
"
,,
2,8,"one on Spooner Street to have his own boat.
"
,,
2,8,"Whoa! All hands on deck! I'm gettin' a boat!
"
,,
2,8,"Hey, Quagmire, I'm also getting a boat too.
"
,,
2,8,"Right on! Whoo!
"
,,
2,8,"I can't wait to get my sea legs! Yeah!
"
,,
2,8,"Well, at least I'll be the fattest guy
"
,,
2,8,"on Spooner Street to get a boat.
"
,,
2,8,"Hey, hey, hey! I'm gettin' a boat!
"
,,
2,8,"Oh, man. Even Della Reese is getting a boat.
"
,,
2,8,"These wonderful homes
"
,,
2,8,"on this beautifully secluded island
"
,,
2,8,"can be yours with almost no strings attached.
"
,,
2,8,"Beautiful island.
"
,,
2,8,"Nothing out of the ordinary here.
"
,,
2,8,"Just beautiful homes and nothing else.
"
,,
2,8,"Each residence has 200 feet
"
,,
2,8,"of pristine ocean front.
"
,,
2,8,"No city noise,
"
,,
2,8,"no flesh-eating ogres, no pollution.
"
,,
2,8,"I hate these high-pressure sales situations.
"
,,
2,8,"That's so cute. You're just afraid that because
"
,,
2,8,"you're a woman, you'll do something stupid,
"
,,
2,8,"like buy that time-share, or not realise I taped
"
,,
2,8,"over our wedding video with soft-core porn.
"
,,
2,8," You taped over our wedding video?
"
,,
2,8," Relax. I just taped over the boring stuff.
"
,,
2,8,"The couple has written their own vows,
"
,,
2,8,"which they will now recite.
"
,,
2,8,"Peter, I...
"
,,
2,8,"Look, the only reason I got myself arrested
"
,,
2,8,"was to find out what happened to my sister.
"
,,
2,8,"Excuse me, ladies, it's laundry time.
"
,,
2,8,"It's so cold in here. I mean, look at my...
"
,,
2,8,"Oh, my God, Peter. I sent a copy
"
,,
2,8,"of that tape to my great-aunt Lil.
"
,,
2,8,"This wedding is hot!
"
,,
2,8,"Wake up, dammit! Wake up!
"
,,
2,8,"Mr and Mrs... Griffin. If you sign this contract
"
,,
2,8,"without reading it, I'll take your blank cheque,
"
,,
2,8,"and you won't not be not loving
"
,,
2,8,"your time-share before you know it.
"
,,
2,8,"We're not gonna buy your lousy time-share,
"
,,
2,8,"all right? Now where's my boat?
"
,,
2,8,"Hold on! You have a choice.
"
,,
2,8,"You can have the boat or the mystery box.
"
,,
2,8," Are you crazy? We'll take the boat.
"
,,
2,8," Not so fast, Lois.
"
,,
2,8,"A boat's a boat,
"
,,
2,8,"but the mystery box could be anything.
"
,,
2,8,"It could even be a boat!
"
,,
2,8,"You know how much we want one.
"
,,
2,8," Let's...
"
,,
2,8," We'll take the box.
"
,,
2,8,"""We'll take the box."" You gave up a boat
"
,,
2,8,"for free tickets to a crappy comedy club.
"
,,
2,8,"You're acting like this is the first time
"
,,
2,8,"I've ever done something stupid.
"
,,
2,8,"Remember the time we went to get that boat?
"
,,
2,8,"A boat's a boat,
"
,,
2,8,"but the mystery box could be anything.
"
,,
2,8,"It could even be a boat!
"
,,
2,8,"You know how much we want one.
"
,,
2,8," Let's...
"
,,
2,8," We'll take the box.
"
,,
2,8," Peter, that just happened ten minutes ago.
"
,,
2,8," Who cares? I bet nobody took the boat.
"
,,
2,8,"Who could resist the call of the mystery box?
"
,,
2,8,"Yahoo!
"
,,
2,8,"Hey, look at me!
"
,,
2,8,"I'm the man in the boat! All right!
"
,,
2,8," Joe, look to the right. It's the Griffins.
"
,,
2,8," We're nautical now, baby.
"
,,
2,8,"That's called starboard. But I'll forgive you
"
,,
2,8,"cos you sex me up. Now give me some sugar.
"
,,
2,8," Hey, neighbours! Where's your boat?
"
,,
2,8," We didn't take the boat.
"
,,
2,8,"We took the mystery box. Hop in.
"
,,
2,8,"Hey, Quagmire, maybe
"
,,
2,8,"the comedian will tell some jokes
"
,,
2,8,"about boats or boating or owning a boat.
"
,,
2,8,"Yeah. Or maybe he'll tell some jokes
"
,,
2,8,"about being a sucker.
"
,,
2,8,"Oh, Quagmire,
"
,,
2,8,"you're what the Spaniards call el terrible. 
"
,,
2,8,"Why are you upset?
"
,,
2,8,"I never even knew you liked boats.
"
,,
2,8,"Boating's in my blood. Ever since
"
,,
2,8,"my great-grandfather, Huck Griffin,
"
,,
2,8,"rafted down the mighty Mississippi.
"
,,
2,8," What did you just call me?
"
,,
2,8," I... I thought that was your name.
"
,,
2,8,"That is our word. You've got no right using it.
"
,,
2,8,"Hey, hey, hey. I'm cool, I'm cool. No problem.
"
,,
2,8," Could you pass me the oar, N-word Jim.
"
,,
2,8," Thank you.
"
,,
2,8,"This comic sucks!
"
,,
2,8,"He couldn't make me laugh
"
,,
2,8,"even if I was laughing my ass off
"
,,
2,8,"and he was making me do it. Huh?
"
,,
2,8," Come on, Skinny! Make me laugh!
"
,,
2,8," Peter, that's a microphone stand.
"
,,
2,8,"Oh, well, pardon me for thinking
"
,,
2,8,"a microphone stand in a comedy club
"
,,
2,8,"should tell a joke or two.
"
,,
2,8,"I guess I'm just old-fashioned that way.
"
,,
2,8," Hi. Welcome to...
"
,,
2,8," Ha-ha-ha-ha! Very funny!
"
,,
2,8," Excuse me, sir. I haven't even...
"
,,
2,8," That one was hilarious.
"
,,
2,8,"That was even funnier than your first joke.
"
,,
2,8,"Put Skinny back up there.
"
,,
2,8," Peter!
"
,,
2,8," You think this is easy?
"
,,
2,8," You wanna come up here and try this?
"
,,
2,8," I thought you'd never ask.
"
,,
2,8,"Maybe you shouldn't do this.
"
,,
2,8,"You've never had a lot of luck telling jokes.
"
,,
2,8,"OK, OK. How many dirty, stinking apes
"
,,
2,8,"does it take to screw in a light bulb?
"
,,
2,8,"Three. One dirty, stinking ape
"
,,
2,8,"to screw in the light bulb,
"
,,
2,8,"and two dirty, stinking apes
"
,,
2,8,"to throw faeces at each other.
"
,,
2,8,"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
"
,,
2,8,"Don't worry. I... I got it under control.
"
,,
2,8,"Hey, hey, how about that Viagra, huh?
"
,,
2,8,"You know what that stuff does? Huh?
"
,,
2,8,"Huh?
"
,,
2,8,"Come on!
"
,,
2,8,"What, are you people stupid?
"
,,
2,8,"Ah! You like a little abuse, huh?
"
,,
2,8,"Yeah. Well, you gu...
"
,,
2,8,"you guys are stupid and ugly.
"
,,
2,8,"If there was a stupid-and-ugly contest,
"
,,
2,8,"you'd all win!
"
,,
2,8,"Or lose. Whichever's funnier.
"
,,
2,8,"Hey, Lois. What do you call a woman
"
,,
2,8,"who takes for ever to cook breakfast?
"
,,
2,8," I swear to God, Peter...
"
,,
2,8," You call her Lois.
"
,,
2,8,"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
"
,,
2,8,"Ha-ha-ha-ha! Well, the fat man made a funny.
"
,,
2,8,"I rather enjoyed that.
"
,,
2,8,"Yes, yes. Yes, you cook very slowly.
"
,,
2,8,"As a matter of fact, if you were
"
,,
2,8,"any slower at cooking, you'd...
"
,,
2,8,"well, you wouldn't be cooking very fast at all,
"
,,
2,8,"now, would you? That one wasn't very good.
"
,,
2,8,"They laughed because it looked like you peed
"
,,
2,8,"yourself, not because they liked your jokes.
"
,,
2,8,"Well, maybe that was part of my act.
"
,,
2,8,"Urine happens to be very edgy,
"
,,
2,8,"but an unfunny person like you
"
,,
2,8,"wouldn't understand that.
"
,,
2,8,"OK, OK, I've got it, I've got it.
"
,,
2,8,"If you cooked any more slowly,
"
,,
2,8,"you wouldn't need an egg timer,
"
,,
2,8,"you'd need an egg calendar! Ha-ha-ha!
"
,,
2,8,"That's right. I went there.
"
,,
2,8,"OK, OK, OK. Wait. Here's another one.
"
,,
2,8,"Why do women have boobs?
"
,,
2,8,"So you got something to look at
"
,,
2,8,"while you're talking to 'em.
"
,,
2,8," That's great!
"
,,
2,8," That's a good one. That's what they're for!
"
,,
2,8,"Are you telling jokes? I love jokes.
"
,,
2,8,"All right. Then you'll love this one. OK.
"
,,
2,8,"Why do women have boobs?
"
,,
2,8,"So you got something to look at
"
,,
2,8,"while you're talking to 'em. Ha-ha-ha-ha!
"
,,
2,8,"So you got something to look at
"
,,
2,8,"while you're talking to 'em. Ha-ha-ha-ha!
"
,,
2,8,"So you got...
"
,,
2,8,"You... you wanted to see me, Mr Weed?
"
,,
2,8,"Peter, we have a problem.
"
,,
2,8,"Mr Griffin, I'm Gloria Ironbox. I represent
"
,,
2,8,"one of your co-workers, Sarah Bennett.
"
,,
2,8,"She's suing you and the company
"
,,
2,8,"for sexual harassment.
"
,,
2,8,"Sarah... Sarah... I don't...
"
,,
2,8,"Oh, is she the one
"
,,
2,8,"we video-taped taking a dump?
"
,,
2,8,"Why? What happened?
"
,,
2,8,"Sexual harassment is
"
,,
2,8,"a very serious charge, Mr Griffin.
"
,,
2,8,"First of all, if I can speak in my own defence,
"
,,
2,8,"all I did was tell a little joke.
"
,,
2,8,"Second of all, women are not people.
"
,,
2,8,"They are devices built by the Lord
"
,,
2,8,"Jesus Christ for our entertainment.
"
,,
2,8,"Peter, please!
"
,,
2,8,"Miss Ironbox, I assure you this company
"
,,
2,8,"in no way condones Peter's conduct.
"
,,
2,8,"In fact, a film on employee relations
"
,,
2,8,"has been a mandatory part
"
,,
2,8,"of our personnel training for 50 years.
"
,,
2,8,"Irrational and emotionally fragile by nature,
"
,,
2,8,"female co-workers are a peculiar animal.
"
,,
2,8,"They are very insecure
"
,,
2,8,"about their appearance.
"
,,
2,8,"Be sure to tell them
"
,,
2,8,"how good they look every day,
"
,,
2,8,"even if they're homely and unkempt.
"
,,
2,8,"You're doing a great job, Muriel,
"
,,
2,8,"and you're prettier than Mamie Van Doren.
"
,,
2,8,"And, remember, nothing says ""good job""
"
,,
2,8,"like a firm, open-palm slap on the behind.
"
,,
2,8,"I teach a workplace sensitivity training class
"
,,
2,8,"for the Women's Action Coalition.
"
,,
2,8,"If Mr Griffin completes my course,
"
,,
2,8,"we'll drop the lawsuit.
"
,,
2,8,"I assure you, Peter will be there.
"
,,
2,8,"His job depends on it.
"
,,
2,8,"Good. I'm looking forward to it.
"
,,
2,8,"You know, if I wasn't so sure you were
"
,,
2,8,"a lesbian, I'd say you were coming on to me.
"
,,
2,8,"All right, now let's do some role-playing.
"
,,
2,8,"I'll be the office assistant.
"
,,
2,8,"Mr Hanson, you play the boss
"
,,
2,8,"and we'll see what you've learned tonight.
"
,,
2,8,"OK.
"
,,
2,8," The filing is done, Mr Hanson.
"
,,
2,8," Thank you, Miss Ironbox.
"
,,
2,8,"You are a valued member
"
,,
2,8,"of our business team
"
,,
2,8,"and every bit as important
"
,,
2,8,"to this company as I am.
"
,,
2,8,"Excellent. Mr Griffin, why don't you
"
,,
2,8,"come up here and give it a try?
"
,,
2,8,"All right.
"
,,
2,8," The filing is done, Mr Griffin.
"
,,
2,8," Thank you, Miss Ironbox.
"
,,
2,8,"You're a valued member of our business
"
,,
2,8,"team and I will give you a raise tomorrow
"
,,
2,8,"if you come to work without a shirt on.
"
,,
2,8," Mr Griffin!
"
,,
2,8," I'm sorry. That came out wrong.
"
,,
2,8,"Let me try again.
"
,,
2,8," Nice ass.
"
,,
2,8," You haven't heard a word I've said.
"
,,
2,8,"That's not fair.
"
,,
2,8,"I've heard everything you've said.
"
,,
2,8,"There's some subtleties to the rules
"
,,
2,8,"that aren't so easy to understand.
"
,,
2,8," Honk, honk.
"
,,
2,8," OK, that's it!
"
,,
2,8,"Obviously normal sensitivity training
"
,,
2,8,"isn't enough for you.
"
,,
2,8,"No. We're gonna have to
"
,,
2,8,"do something drastic.
"
,,
2,8,"A week at a women's retreat. What the hell
"
,,
2,8,"am I supposed to learn from that?
"
,,
2,8,"Face it, your attitude towards women
"
,,
2,8,"isn't exactly enlightened.
"
,,
2,8,"That's a bad mud puddle.
"
,,
2,8,"I wouldn't want you to step in that
"
,,
2,8,"and get your nice shoes all ruined.
"
,,
2,8,"Then you got caught peeping
"
,,
2,8,"in the ladies' locker room.
"
,,
2,8,"OK, move the towel, move the towel.
"
,,
2,8,"Oh! Oh! They spotted me!
"
,,
2,8,"Peter, I think this'll be good for you.
"
,,
2,8,"You know I love you,
"
,,
2,8,"but I have to admit there are times
"
,,
2,8,"when I wish you were a little more sensitive.
"
,,
2,8,"Look at me. Look at me!
"
,,
2,8,"Hello, ladies. I'm Miss Watson,
"
,,
2,8,"director of the retreat.
"
,,
2,8,"I'd like to welcome Peter Griffin, who's here
"
,,
2,8,"to get in touch with his feminine side.
"
,,
2,8,"This world would be far better
"
,,
2,8,"if there were more men like him.
"
,,
2,8,"OK, OK, so here's what I'm thinking.
"
,,
2,8,"I'll be Charlie and you can all be my angels.
"
,,
2,8,"Except you. You'll be Bosley.
"
,,
2,8,"We women have so much strength inside us.
"
,,
2,8,"If we can endure the pain of childbirth,
"
,,
2,8,"imagine what else we're capable of.
"
,,
2,8,"Right on, sister!
"
,,
2,8,"Wah, wah, wah. Come on!
"
,,
2,8,"It's only childbirth. How much could it hurt?
"
,,
2,8,"It's like taking your bottom lip and stretching
"
,,
2,8,"it over your head to the back of your neck.
"
,,
2,8,"Hey, you wanna hear some horror stories,
"
,,
2,8,"what about what I went through
"
,,
2,8,"when Lois was pregnant?
"
,,
2,8,"We are conditioned to feel competitive with
"
,,
2,8,"other women when we should be supportive.
"
,,
2,8,"Lizzy, I know you feel alone and unattractive
"
,,
2,8,"since your husband left you.
"
,,
2,8,"But you are a beautiful person
"
,,
2,8,"and I am here for you.
"
,,
2,8,"Notice I'm making physical contact with her
"
,,
2,8,"in order to establish a connection.
"
,,
2,8,"You'd make more of a connection
"
,,
2,8,"if you hugged her.
"
,,
2,8,"Very good, Peter! That's true.
"
,,
2,8,"That's it. Now rub her back.
"
,,
2,8,"OK, that's good. Yeah, comfort her.
"
,,
2,8,"Yeah. Oh, yeah. You like that, don't you?
"
,,
2,8,"It's OK. It's OK to like it. It's very natural.
"
,,
2,8,"OK, good, good. Now smell her a little.
"
,,
2,8," I can't do it.
"
,,
2,8," Yes, you can.
"
,,
2,8,"Trust your sisters. Jump into the trust quilt.
"
,,
2,8," Jump! Trust us. We love you!
"
,,
2,8," We'll catch you.
"
,,
2,8,"OK, me next, me next!
"
,,
2,8,"OK, ladies. I'm gonna start with
"
,,
2,8,"a Greg Louganis triple Salchow
"
,,
2,8,"and tuck into a flying Mary Lou Retton half...
"
,,
2,8,"Aagh! Aagh! Ooh! Aagh!
"
,,
2,8,"Ow! Aagh! Aagh! Aagh!
"
,,
2,8,"Aaaaaagh! Aagh! Ow!
"
,,
2,8,"Now that you've felt a woman's pain,
"
,,
2,8,"the learning can begin.
"
,,
2,8,"Welcome back, Peter.
"
,,
2,8,"Lois!
"
,,
2,8,"I missed you so much. And my babies!
"
,,
2,8,"Chris, be a munchkin
"
,,
2,8,"and bring my bags inside.
"
,,
2,8," Peter, you're, uh...
"
,,
2,8," Brian, put the tea on. I have stories.
"
,,
2,8,"But first I'm gonna go freshen up
"
,,
2,8,"and rinse out a few things.
"
,,
2,8,"Oh, fudge! I broke a nail. Excuse me.
"
,,
2,8,"Oh, my God! Dad's a chick!
"
,,
2,8,"I can't remember the last time
"
,,
2,8,"we cuddled like this.
"
,,
2,8,"I can't remember the last time
"
,,
2,8,"I loved you so much.
"
,,
2,8,"Oh, how did you get so sweet?
"
,,
2,8,"When I was born, my mommy
"
,,
2,8,"dunked me in a barrel of sugar.
"
,,
2,8,"Oh, for God's sake.
"
,,
2,8,"Oh, yes. Yes, I want the coffee cake.
"
,,
2,8," Hello!
"
,,
2,8," Hey, Quagmire.
"
,,
2,8," Hey, Peter, what's up?
"
,,
2,8," Not much.
"
,,
2,8," Well, what do you want?
"
,,
2,8," Nothing. I just called to talk.
"
,,
2,8," What you thinking about?
"
,,
2,8," What do you mean? You called me.
"
,,
2,8,"I just wanted to say hi. So what are you d...?
"
,,
2,8,"Sometimes I just can't believe
"
,,
2,8,"we could make something so beautiful.
"
,,
2,8,"He looks just like his father.
"
,,
2,8,"I really appreciate all the hard work you did
"
,,
2,8,"giving birth and mothering our kids.
"
,,
2,8,"I'll never know that joy.
"
,,
2,8,"Peter, I'm sure you would have been
"
,,
2,8,"a great mother if you'd had the chance.
"
,,
2,8," You think so?
"
,,
2,8," I know so.
"
,,
2,8,"One of these days
"
,,
2,8,"I'm gonna need the mirror.
"
,,
2,8,"Oh, beans! I can't get this spit curl to...
"
,,
2,8," Lois, what day is it?
"
,,
2,8," Thursday.
"
,,
2,8,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God! I'm late.
"
,,
2,8," If you spent less time fixing your hair...
"
,,
2,8," No, Lois. I'm late late!
"
,,
2,8," Do we still have that pregnancy test?
"
,,
2,8," Are you insane? You can't have a baby.
"
,,
2,8,"Well, I don't have a lot of options.
"
,,
2,8,"I'm Catholic!
"
,,
2,8,"God! I thought you'd be happy!
"
,,
2,8,"Oh. Oh, this is just great. Now my own wife is
"
,,
2,8,"forced to cook dinner for her lousy husband?
"
,,
2,8,"Peter, you're my husband.
"
,,
2,8,"At least, you used to be.
"
,,
2,8,"Oh, Mother, I come bearing a gift.
"
,,
2,8,"I'll give you a hint.
"
,,
2,8," It's in my diaper and it's not a toaster.
"
,,
2,8," Meg, can you change Stewie?
"
,,
2,8,"Fine. But this time if a boy calls,
"
,,
2,8,"please don't tell him I'm wrist-deep in poopie.
"
,,
2,8,"Honey, I'm glad you discovered
"
,,
2,8,"your feminine side,
"
,,
2,8,"but I didn't want you to forget about mine.
"
,,
2,8,"Remember this? Huh?
"
,,
2,8," Remember?
"
,,
2,8," Oh, my God. That reminds me.
"
,,
2,8,"I gotta get myself a breast exam.
"
,,
2,8,"Uh-oh. Uh-oh!
"
,,
2,8,"A lump. A lump! Oh, God! Oh, God!
"
,,
2,8,"No, Cheeto.
"
,,
2,8,"Lois.
"
,,
2,8,"How expected.
"
,,
2,8,"Hi, Glen. I'm sorry to bother you.
"
,,
2,8,"Is this a bad time?
"
,,
2,8,"It's never a bad time when
"
,,
2,8,"you're with the Q man. Come on in.
"
,,
2,8,"Well, as you may have noticed,
"
,,
2,8,"Peter's been acting a little different lately.
"
,,
2,8,"It was refreshing at first, but now... well, he
"
,,
2,8,"doesn't even treat me like a woman any more.
"
,,
2,8,"I know where this is going, Lois,
"
,,
2,8,"and I'm already semi there. Oh!
"
,,
2,8,"Anyways, Glen,
"
,,
2,8,"I was wondering if you and Cleveland
"
,,
2,8,"could help change Peter
"
,,
2,8,"back to the way he was.
"
,,
2,8,"Of course that's why you're here.
"
,,
2,8," Don't worry, I'd do everything to you.
"
,,
2,8," What?
"
,,
2,8,"I'd do anything for you.
"
,,
2,8,"If we're gonna remasculate Peter,
"
,,
2,8,"we need to surround him with chicks.
"
,,
2,8,"Let's blow this sausagefest
"
,,
2,8,"and hit the house of tail.
"
,,
2,8,"No. He needs to learn
"
,,
2,8,"how to respect his fellow man.
"
,,
2,8,"That's what this march is all about.
"
,,
2,8,"Respect for your fellow man.
"
,,
2,8,"I can't respect men. Men are the reason
"
,,
2,8,"our world is in such lousy shape.
"
,,
2,8,"If men were as caring as women,
"
,,
2,8,"we wouldn't have crime or violence.
"
,,
2,8,"My brothers, we need to stand together...
"
,,
2,8,"Excuse me. I'd like to say a couple of truths
"
,,
2,8,"to the men in this audience.
"
,,
2,8,"It's your fault we have
"
,,
2,8,"so much crime in this country
"
,,
2,8,"and it's your fault we have
"
,,
2,8,"so much violence in this country.
"
,,
2,8,"You are ruining our society
"
,,
2,8,"and you should be ashamed!
"
,,
2,8,"Look, I don't care how many letters we gotta
"
,,
2,8,"write. The View should be on for three hours.
"
,,
2,8,"You just get going and it's News at Noon. 
"
,,
2,8," Can we go soon?
"
,,
2,8," Not yet.
"
,,
2,8,"Gloria Ironbox and Camille Paglia are
"
,,
2,8,"gonna whip it out and see whose is bigger.
"
,,
2,8,"Peter, I'm so glad you could make it.
"
,,
2,8," Gloria, this is my life partner Lois.
"
,,
2,8," I'm his wife.
"
,,
2,8,"His wife, yes. Peter tells me
"
,,
2,8,"you don't have a career of your own.
"
,,
2,8,"Oh, no. Life outside my kitchen
"
,,
2,8,"is so bright and scary.
"
,,
2,8,"I'm just here because you caught me
"
,,
2,8,"between pregnancies.
"
,,
2,8,"Well, I'm sorry you're so hostile
"
,,
2,8,"toward someone who's fighting
"
,,
2,8,"so a woman like you can become
"
,,
2,8,"more than just a housewife.
"
,,
2,8,"Oh, just a housewife?
"
,,
2,8,"Look, I'm all for equality,
"
,,
2,8,"but if you ask me feminism is about choice.
"
,,
2,8,"I choose to be a wife and mother. And now
"
,,
2,8,"I'm choosing to end this conversation.
"
,,
2,8,"No wonder your husband
"
,,
2,8,"didn't respect women.
"
,,
2,8,"Excuse me?
"
,,
2,8,"I can't imagine how screwed up
"
,,
2,8,"your kids must be.
"
,,
2,8,"You bitch!
"
,,
2,8,"Ten banana cream pies.
"
,,
2,8,"Holy crap, this is hot.
"
,,
2,8,"Lois, we gotta go.
"
,,
2,8," That was wonderful.
"
,,
2,8," Who said that?
"
,,
2,8,"Oh, hey, Lois. I'm starving.
"
,,
2,8,"How about a sandwich?
"
,,
2,8," Glad to have you back, Peter.
"
,,
2,8," Lois, less talky, more fetchy.
"
,,
2,8,"I'm just gonna assume
"
,,
2,8,"that's Chinese for ""I love you"".

2,9,"Hey, Stewie, I see your bum.
"

2,9,"Hey, Lois, give Chris a break.
"
,,
2,9,"I mean, no TV?
"
,,
2,9,"He failed a class,
"
,,
2,9,"it's not like he felt up his cousin...
"
,,
2,9,"...in the garage
"
,,
2,9,"that Thanksgiving when I was 19.
"
,,
2,9,"I want you to help Chris.
"
,,
2,9,"Kids do better when parents
"
,,
2,9,"take an interest in their schoolwork.
"

"

2,9,"If Chris gets his homework done,

2,9,"Okay, come on, let's watch the Gumbels.

2,9,"Peter, I thought we agreed,
"
,,
2,9,"no TV until his homework is done.
"
,,
2,9," Mom, I'll do it after...
"
,,
2,9," Chris finished his homework.

2,9,"All right, Callaghan, me and my son

"

2,9,"I have all the episodes on tape

"
,,
2,9,"Okay, you want to play rough?
"
,,
2,9,"Until you bring the Gumbels back,
"
,,
2,9,"I am going on a hunger strike.
"
,,
2,9,"How about that, Callaghan?
"
,,
2,9,"Can you live with that on your conscience?
"
,,
2,9,"You gonna eat that stapler?
"

2,9," You can't eat a stapler...
"

2,9," Wanna split it?
"
,,
2,9,"Sorry. Me and my damn appetite!
"
,,
2,9,"It's not the first time it brought me trouble.
"

2,9,"And in gridiron news,
"

2,9,"little Johnny Gobraun...
"
,,
2,9,"...a terminally ill 8-year-old
"
,,
2,9,"who dreamed of playing quarterback...
"
,,
2,9,"...for New England got his wish today
"
,,
2,9,"thanks to the Grant-a-Dream foundation.
"
,,
2,9,"Gobraun takes the snap
"
,,
2,9,"and fades back to pass.
"
,,
2,9,"Here comes the rush. Oh, he's sacked!
"
,,
2,9,"Looks like little Johnny
"
,,
2,9,"should've wished for some blocking.
"
,,
2,9,"Chris, I just thought of a way
"
,,
2,9,"to get the Gumbels back on the air.
"
,,
2,9,"All right, Dad!
"
,,
2,9,"All we gotta do is tell
"
,,
2,9,"a little white lie. Just go with it.
"
,,
2,9,"Is this the Grant-a-Dream foundation?
"
,,
2,9," My son Chris is dying!
"
,,
2,9," Holy crap, no! Oh, my God!
"
,,
2,9,"That was the lie.
"
,,
2,9,"Oh, you sly boots.
"
,,
2,9,"Are you sure this will work?
"
,,
2,9,"Chris, this is just another one
"
,,
2,9,"of your crazy schemes.
"
,,
2,9,"This whole thing was your idea!
"
,,
2,9,"You'll find out.
"
,,
2,9,"Dad, you're not making any sense!
"
,,
2,9,"You just leave that to me.
"
,,
2,9,"Ah, yes. Here we go.
"
,,
2,9,"Chris Griffin.
"
,,
2,9,"Your dying wish is denied.
"
,,
2,9,"Thank you.
"
,,
2,9,"Wait a minute.
"
,,
2,9,"My son only has a short time to live.
"
,,
2,9,"All he wants is his favorite show
"
,,
2,9,"back on TV. How can you say no?
"
,,
2,9,"Mr. Griffin, everyone thinks
"
,,
2,9,"their dying child is special.
"
,,
2,9,"But these days, people who donate money
"
,,
2,9,"to our foundation...
"
,,
2,9,"...demand a little more bang for their buck.
"
,,
2,9,"We need sick kids we can package.
"
,,
2,9,"Like that one we put
"
,,
2,9,"on Hollywood Squares.
"
,,
2,9,"I'll take the dying boy to block.
"
,,
2,9,"Jeremy, is there anything lower
"
,,
2,9,"than absolute zero?
"
,,
2,9,"Yeah. My white-cell count.
"
,,
2,9,"I'm telling you, Chris is dying
"
,,
2,9,"ten times worse than those other kids.
"
,,
2,9,"He's got a very rare disease called
"
,,
2,9,"tumor-syphilis-itis-osis.
"
,,
2,9,"Sounds sexy. What are the symptoms?
"
,,
2,9,"What are the symptoms? Take a look!
"
,,
2,9,"He's growing nipples all over his body!
"
,,
2,9," They look like pepperonis.
"
,,
2,9," Who do you think you are?
"
,,
2,9,"My son happens to be very sensitive
"
,,
2,9,"about his extra nipples.
"
,,
2,9,"See, look. They're coming right off.
"
,,
2,9,"Nipples shouldn't just come off like that.
"
,,
2,9,"Why, that's the sickest boy I've ever seen!
"
,,
2,9,"Get me the president of television!
"
,,
2,9,"How about this?
"
,,
2,9,"A single white girl in the city
"
,,
2,9,"working at a magazine!
"
,,
2,9,"Yeah, that's good.
"
,,
2,9,"Yeah.
"
,,
2,9,"Do you guys hear yourselves?
"
,,
2,9,"This is the same old crap
"
,,
2,9,"over and over again.
"
,,
2,9,"We need to take a chance.
"
,,
2,9,"Try something different. Something fresh.
"
,,
2,9,"Excuse me.
"
,,
2,9," No calls!
"
,,
2,9," It's about a dying boy.
"
,,
2,9,"Hello? What's he got?
"
,,
2,9,"Sounds sexy.
"
,,
2,9,"Get me exclusive rights to his death
"
,,
2,9,"and you got a deal.
"
,,
2,9,"Congratulations,
"
,,
2,9,"Gumbel 2 Gumbel is back on the air!
"
,,
2,9,"All right, Dad!
"
,,
2,9,"I'm sorry we had to meet
"
,,
2,9,"under these circumstances.
"
,,
2,9,"Are you kidding? I may see you again.
"
,,
2,9,"I've two more kids,
"
,,
2,9,"and I've always wanted to see...
"
,,
2,9,"...new episodes of Star Trek.
"
,,
2,9,"Stewie, it's bath time. You're filthy again.
"
,,
2,9,"I'll show you filthy!
"
,,
2,9,"Yes, look at me! I'm a dirty, foul little boy!
"
,,
2,9,"I'm a nasty, squalid little hobo!
"
,,
2,9,"I say, Mother, you have your work cut out
"
,,
2,9,"for you now, don't you?
"
,,
2,9,"Okay, if you want to be dirty, be dirty.
"
,,
2,9,"Where do you think you're going?
"
,,
2,9,"I've defiled myself.
"
,,
2,9,"I need to be cleaned!
"
,,
2,9,"There you go, kiddo. All clean.
"
,,
2,9,"Blast! I'm frozen! I'm hypothermic!
"
,,
2,9,"Bloody hell, I'm a woman!
"
,,
2,9,"Take out your pencils and start your test.
"
,,
2,9,"Mr. McCloud, I didn't study for the test,
"
,,
2,9,"but I got a good reason.
"
,,
2,9,"I'm dying.
"
,,
2,9,"That's the lamest excuse I've heard since
"
,,
2,9,"Steinberg's Jewish High Holiday crap.
"
,,
2,9,"Take that hat off in my classroom!
"
,,
2,9,"But Mr. McCloud, I'm really dying.
"
,,
2,9,"I have a certificate to prove it.
"
,,
2,9,"My God! Tumor-syphilis-itis-osis!
"
,,
2,9,"And he still comes into school!
"
,,
2,9,"You're excused from the test,
"
,,
2,9,"you brave, brave boy.
"
,,
2,9,"You can learn something
"
,,
2,9,"from this fine young...
"
,,
2,9,"Damn it, Steinberg! Take that hat off!
"
,,
2,9,"Dad, Marcy Gibbons just called!
"
,,
2,9,"She heard that Chris is dying!
"
,,
2,9,"Your brother's okay.
"
,,
2,9,"That was just a little white lie
"
,,
2,9,"we came up with to save a TV show.
"
,,
2,9,"So he's not going to die?
"
,,
2,9,"No.
"
,,
2,9,"Boy, your face was priceless
"
,,
2,9,"when you thought he was.
"
,,
2,9,"You're a monster.
"
,,
2,9,"Chris was in on the whole thing.
"
,,
2,9,"Anyway, it's over and done with.
"
,,
2,9,"Anyway, it's over and done with.
"
,,
2,9,"What the hell is that?
"
,,
2,9,"""Oh, dyin' boy of Quahog
"
,,
2,9,"""Chris Griffin, you're so brave
"
,,
2,9,"""There's a smile on your face
"
,,
2,9,"and a bounce in your step
"
,,
2,9,"""as they dig your grave
"
,,
2,9,"""as they dig your grave""
"
,,
2,9,"Do I hear singing?
"
,,
2,9,"No! No singing.
"
,,
2,9,"Just us watching another
"
,,
2,9,"hilarious episode of Good Times.
"
,,
2,9,"The sitcom that's funnier
"
,,
2,9,"when you play it really loud.
"
,,
2,9,"Maxine is the lady who's feeling all right...
"
,,
2,9,"...thanks to the magic of Kid Dynomite!
"
,,
2,9,"Junior, where you been?
"
,,
2,9,"Dinner was three hours ago!
"
,,
2,9,"Oh, forget him, James.
"
,,
2,9," He's an idiot!
"
,,
2,9," Mama, what's wrong with you?
"
,,
2,9,"What's wrong with me?
"
,,
2,9,"My name is Florida!
"
,,
2,9,"Florida! That's the name of a state!
"
,,
2,9,"Why is my name Florida?
"
,,
2,9,"Oh, Lord!
"
,,
2,9,"Dynomite!
"
,,
2,9,"That is singing.
"
,,
2,9,"Peter, there's a candlelight vigil
"
,,
2,9,"on our front lawn.
"
,,
2,9,"Lois, that's ridiculous.
"
,,
2,9,"There's nobody out there.
"
,,
2,9,"You must be seeing things.
"
,,
2,9,"Peter, why are these people here?
"
,,
2,9,"""As they dig my grave,
"
,,
2,9,"as they dig my grave""
"
,,
2,9,"Hey, Dad, they're singing a song about me!
"
,,
2,9,"Hi, Mom.
"
,,
2,9,"Hello, Mr. Griffin.
"
,,
2,9,"We just came by to see if your son's
"
,,
2,9,"taken a media-friendly turn for the worse.
"
,,
2,9,"No. Everything's fine.
"
,,
2,9,"Thanks for checking. Bye-bye.
"
,,
2,9,"Mr. Griffin, the foundation
"
,,
2,9,"held up its end of the bargain...
"
,,
2,9,"...and got that crappy Gumbel show
"
,,
2,9,"back on the air!
"
,,
2,9," You owe us a body!
"
,,
2,9," What?
"
,,
2,9,"Excuse me for a minute.
"
,,
2,9,"You pretended Chris was dying
"
,,
2,9,"to save a TV show?
"
,,
2,9,"You're a monster!
"
,,
2,9,"Thank you.
"
,,
2,9,"You tell that man the truth!
"
,,
2,9,"Just out of curiosity...
"
,,
2,9," Shoot.
"
,,
2,9," What happens if he's not really dying?
"
,,
2,9,"You go to jail
"
,,
2,9,"for defrauding a charitable organization.
"
,,
2,9,"That's interesting.
"
,,
2,9,"Will you excuse us?
"
,,
2,9,"You're right!
"
,,
2,9,"There's only one way out of this!
"
,,
2,9,"Chris is all better! I cured him!
"
,,
2,9,"You cured him?
"
,,
2,9,"That's right. I have divine powers!
"
,,
2,9,"Okay. Safe drive.
"
,,
2,9,"What do you have to say to that?
"
,,
2,9,"I'm not going to jail,
"
,,
2,9,"Chris doesn't have to die...
"
,,
2,9,"...and best of all,
"
,,
2,9,"Gumbel 2 Gumbel is back on the air.
"
,,
2,9,"You're a great role model.
"
,,
2,9,"What kind of man devalues
"
,,
2,9,"the life of his child for a TV show?
"
,,
2,9,"Anyone who wouldn't pretend
"
,,
2,9,"their own son is dying...
"
,,
2,9,"...to get the Gumbels back on TV is a racist.
"
,,
2,9,"It's him! It's Peter Griffin!
"
,,
2,9,"The miracle healer of Quahog!
"
,,
2,9,"Heal me, O great one!
"
,,
2,9,"You see what your lies have done?
"
,,
2,9,"They think you're some kind of healer.
"
,,
2,9,"I'll handle it.
"
,,
2,9,"I read a book about this sort of thing once.
"
,,
2,9,"Are you sure it was a book?
"
,,
2,9,"Are you sure it wasn't nothing?
"
,,
2,9,"Oh, yeah.
"
,,
2,9,"These poor, deluded people
"
,,
2,9,"think you have divine powers.
"
,,
2,9,"Praise Peter!
"
,,
2,9," We are your servants.
"
,,
2,9," It's a miracle!
"
,,
2,9,"What would you have us do,
"
,,
2,9,"O great healer of Quahog?
"
,,
2,9,"There's really no need to do anything.
"
,,
2,9,"Paint my house.
"
,,
2,9,"It's bad enough to lie to your family...
"
,,
2,9,"...but how can you let these people
"
,,
2,9,"think you're a healer?
"
,,
2,9,"This is pure exploitation.
"
,,
2,9,"No, it's not.
"
,,
2,9,"Those films my cousin Rufus used to do
"
,,
2,9,"were pure exploitation.
"
,,
2,9,"From the cats
"
,,
2,9,"who brought you Caddyblack, Blackdraft...
"
,,
2,9,"...and Black Kramer v. Kramer,
"
,,
2,9,"comes a funky flick so bad...
"
,,
2,9,"...you gonna say, ""Damn, that's funky.""
"
,,
2,9,"Oh, you out of time, baby.
"
,,
2,9,"Damn!
"
,,
2,9,"Rufus Griffin stars in...
"
,,
2,9,"...Black to the Future.
"
,,
2,9,"We're talking Marty McSuperfly, dig?
"
,,
2,9,"Marty, I want to be your fine,
"
,,
2,9,"sweet-ass bitch.
"
,,
2,9,"Damn! Brother done kissed his mama!
"
,,
2,9,"Oh, yeah.
"
,,
2,9,"Get me Isaac Hayes.
"
,,
2,9,"Isaac, you know that new sound
"
,,
2,9,"you been looking for?
"
,,
2,9,"Well, listen to this!
"
,,
2,9,"Come on, Lois.
"
,,
2,9,"Stop being such a stick in the mud.
"
,,
2,9,"I'm giving these saps hope.
"
,,
2,9,"And I'm getting the house painted for free.
"
,,
2,9,"It's win-freakin'-win, baby.
"
,,
2,9,"Hey, flathead, chop-chop.
"
,,
2,9,"Hey, great job on the lawn.
"
,,
2,9,"Now do it again,
"
,,
2,9,"and this time leave it a little longer.
"
,,
2,9,"Hey, Dad. Hurry up.
"
,,
2,9,"You're missing Gumbel 2 Gumbel.
"
,,
2,9,"They caught the guy,
"
,,
2,9,"and now they're interviewing him.
"
,,
2,9,"Purse snatching,
"
,,
2,9,"society's fault, or one man's cry for help?
"
,,
2,9,"What are you talking about?
"
,,
2,9,"I wanted her freakin' money.
"
,,
2,9,"What the hell's wrong with him?
"
,,
2,9,"Some other time, Chris.
"
,,
2,9,"Now, where's my shoes?
"
,,
2,9,"These people are worshipping you.
"
,,
2,9,"Don't you think there's someone
"
,,
2,9,"who might resent that?
"
,,
2,9,"A being who's all-knowing
"
,,
2,9,"and all-powerful?
"
,,
2,9,"Someone's got a pretty high
"
,,
2,9,"opinion of herself.
"
,,
2,9,"Not me, Peter. God. The real God.
"
,,
2,9,"What's the big deal?
"
,,
2,9,"So I told a little fib,
"
,,
2,9,"and now people think I'm God.
"
,,
2,9,"When did God ever say
"
,,
2,9,"He didn't want someone else...
"
,,
2,9,"...being worshipped like Him?
"
,,
2,9,"It's one of the Ten Commandments.
"
,,
2,9,"Come on. Those were written,
"
,,
2,9,"like, 200 years ago. Times have changed!
"
,,
2,9,"Okay, let's stay calm.
"
,,
2,9,"Lois, if you're scared,
"
,,
2,9,"I'll hold you until the lights are on again.
"
,,
2,9,"Dad, it's me.
"
,,
2,9,"Go to your room.
"
,,
2,9,"That's the last of them.
"
,,
2,9,"I still don't know how every light bulb
"
,,
2,9,"could go out at the same time.
"
,,
2,9,"Oh, my God.
"
,,
2,9,"Yes?
"
,,
2,9,"That's not funny.
"
,,
2,9,"Those fanatics are building
"
,,
2,9,"a golden idol of you on our lawn.
"
,,
2,9,"I look like a freakin' Emmy.
"
,,
2,9,"Hint-hint.
"
,,
2,9,"Damn it to hell!
"
,,
2,9,"This is embarrassing. I seem to have fleas.
"
,,
2,9,"That's never happened before.
"
,,
2,9,"Morning.
"
,,
2,9,"Chris, puberty hit you like a ton of bricks.
"
,,
2,9,"What do you mean?
"
,,
2,9,"Don't you see what's happening?
"
,,
2,9,"Of course I do, Lois.
"
,,
2,9,"Our fresh-faced little boy
"
,,
2,9,"is becoming a pock-marked...
"
,,
2,9,"...hideously disfigured man.
"
,,
2,9,"Sunrise. Sunset.
"
,,
2,9,"No. The light bulbs last night,
"
,,
2,9,"my fleas, Chris' pimples.
"
,,
2,9,"They're just like darkness,
"
,,
2,9,"gadflies, and boils.
"
,,
2,9,"Three of the plagues God visited upon
"
,,
2,9,"Egypt in the Old Testament.
"
,,
2,9,"Come on, there's a logical explanation
"
,,
2,9,"for all those things.
"
,,
2,9,"There was a power surge,
"
,,
2,9,"you don't bathe...
"
,,
2,9,"...and Chris has had acne problems
"
,,
2,9,"since the fourth grade.
"
,,
2,9,"The kids were all calling him Crisco
"
,,
2,9,"and Pizza Face...
"
,,
2,9,"...and Rootin'-Tootin' Raspberry.
"
,,
2,9,"Remember, Chris?
"
,,
2,9,"Now I do.
"
,,
2,9,"Meg, what's wrong?
"
,,
2,9,"I was giving Stewie a bath, and...
"
,,
2,9,"Trust me, Meg, at his age,
"
,,
2,9,"it's strictly involuntary.
"
,,
2,9,"No! The water,
"
,,
2,9,"it turned all red and goopy, like blood!
"
,,
2,9,"Blood?
"
,,
2,9,"How positively delightful.
"
,,
2,9,"It's as if someone stabbed Mr. Bubble!
"
,,
2,9,"My baby!
"
,,
2,9,"Get out there
"
,,
2,9,"and tell those people the truth.
"
,,
2,9,"Make them stop worshipping you
"
,,
2,9,"before it starts hailing in my house!
"
,,
2,9,"There's gotta be an explanation for all this!
"
,,
2,9,"You want an explanation? God is pissed!
"
,,
2,9,"Let's get out of here!
"
,,
2,9,"Stop it! Stop worshipping me!
"
,,
2,9,"I'm just a big fake...
"
,,
2,9,"...like the moon landing
"
,,
2,9,"and Marky Mark's hog in Boogie Nights...
"
,,
2,9,"...and Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman!
"
,,
2,9,"I don't mean
"
,,
2,9,"that completely untrue gay rumor.
"
,,
2,9,"They're just both really phony, just like me.
"
,,
2,9,"I'm sorry, okay? Now make it stop.
"
,,
2,9,"This is the final plague!
"
,,
2,9,"Good, it's starting to get really old.
"
,,
2,9,"The final plague is
"
,,
2,9,"the death of the first-born son.
"
,,
2,9," No! Stewie!
"
,,
2,9," The first-born son.
"
,,
2,9," Meg.
"
,,
2,9," Your wife.
"
,,
2,9,"Chris!
"
,,
2,9,"Oh, my God. Are you okay?
"
,,
2,9,"Hey, Dad, I can see a white light
"
,,
2,9,"at the end of a long tunnel.
"
,,
2,9,"Oh, that's great, son.
"
,,
2,9,"Light is good. Run towards the light.
"
,,
2,9,"No! Run away from the light!
"
,,
2,9,"Hey, Dad, do you think they got
"
,,
2,9,"Gumbel 2 Gumbel in heaven?
"
,,
2,9,"Yes, son, and there's no reruns
"
,,
2,9,"or commercials...
"
,,
2,9,"...and Kirstie Alley is still hot...
"
,,
2,9,"...and all those scrambled channels
"
,,
2,9,"come in clear as a bell.
"
,,
2,9,"Please don't take him, God. I'm sorry.
"
,,
2,9,"We think the Griffin guy gets it.
"
,,
2,9,"Good, good.
"
,,
2,9,"Peggy, turn off the plagues, please.
"
,,
2,9,"Yes, sir, Mr. Patterson.
"
,,
2,9,"She's new.
"
,,
2,9,"I think the plagues went away.
"
,,
2,9," So did the white light.
"
,,
2,9," Oh, honey!
"
,,
2,9,"Thank God! I mean, thank me!
"
,,
2,9,"Kidding! It was a joke!
"
,,
2,10,"""lt seems today that all you see
"
,,
2,10,"""is violence in movies and sex on TV
"
,,
2,10,"""but where are those good,

"
,,
2,10,"l say, Rupert, these crumpets
"
,,
2,10,"you've prepared look positively divine!
"
,,
2,10,"Excellent texture, provocative support.
"
,,
2,10,"Try another, you say?
"
,,
2,10,"Aren't l the wicked one?
"
,,
2,10,"Stewie, l've told you before, don't eat dirt.
"
,,
2,10,"lt's disgusting.
"
,,
2,10,"And l suppose the bilious curds
"
,,
2,10,"you force-fed me from your teat...
"
,,
2,10,"...were perfectly fine then?
"
,,
2,10," Glen, would you mind holding Stewie?
"
,,
2,10," Said and done.
"
,,
2,10,"Hey there, spud with the mud.
"
,,
2,10,"Good Lord! Do you bathe in Aqua Velva?
"
,,
2,10,"Hi. You've got our votes.
"
,,
2,10,"Thank you, Cleveland.
"
,,
2,10,"Someone has to run against
"
,,
2,10,"that awful Betsy Lebeau.
"
,,
2,10,"She actually opposes background checks
"
,,
2,10,"for new teachers!
"
,,
2,10,"God knows who she might hire.
"
,,
2,10,"So the square of a hypotenuse,
"
,,
2,10,"which we will label C...
"
,,
2,10,"...making the sides opposite both of the
"
,,
2,10,"acute angles A and B...
"
,,
2,10,"...always equals the sum
"
,,
2,10,"of the squares of the other sides.
"
,,
2,10,"Any questions?
"
,,
2,10,"lt's just something l have to do.
"
,,
2,10,"Even if winning means spending time
"
,,
2,10,"out of the house and away from my family.
"
,,
2,10,"Out of the house? Why, l'd be free
"
,,
2,10,"from your oppressive gynocracy!
"
,,
2,10,"You should be out giving speeches,
"
,,
2,10,"shaking hands, kissing babies!
"
,,
2,10,"Not this baby!
"
,,
2,10,"Lois, you seen my pants?
"
,,
2,10,"Boy, l'll be glad when that studio audience
"
,,
2,10,"moves out of the neighborhood.
"
,,
2,10,"Lois, what's with the sign?
"
,,
2,10,"Peter, we discussed this.
"
,,
2,10,"l'm running for School Board.
"
,,
2,10,"You never listen to me.
"
,,
2,10,"Yeah, l remember.
"
,,
2,10,"Hey, Cleveland. Hey, Quagmire.
"
,,
2,10,"Lois, what's with the sign?
"
,,
2,10,"You guys? Chris' principal just called.
"
,,
2,10,"Chris is in trouble.
"
,,
2,10,"That's it! l'm calling the cops!
"
,,
2,10,"Mr. Griffin, l'm afraid
"
,,
2,10,"l have bad news.
"
,,
2,10,"l caught your son peeking
"
,,
2,10,"into the girls' locker room.
"
,,
2,10,"Oh, Chris!
"
,,
2,10,"So what's the big deal?
"
,,
2,10,"lt's normal for a boy his age to be curious.
"
,,
2,10,"l remember when l first noticed

"

2,10,"Your mother is right, son.
"
,,
2,10,"Listen to what it says.
"
,,
2,10," Peter!
"
,,
2,10," l didn't say that.
"
,,
2,10,"Lee Majors did.
"
,,
2,10,"What? Women are things.
"
,,
2,10,"Oh, my God! lt's Mr. Fargas!
"
,,
2,10,"He was my favorite teacher!
"
,,
2,10,"Take out your scalpels, kids.
"
,,
2,10,"We're going to dissect a clown!
"
,,
2,10,"No wonder this clown died.
"

"

2,10,"Why don't you go say hello?
"
,,
2,10,"l'm gonna drop off some campaign flyers

2,10,"in the teachers' lounge.
"
,,
2,10,"Hey, Mr. Fargas!
"
,,
2,10,"lt's me, Peter Griffin!
"
,,
2,10,"Griffin. Sorry, not on the list.
"
,,
2,10,"Don't you remember me?
"
,,
2,10,"l was your favorite student.
"
,,
2,10,"You taught me everything. Math, science.
"
,,
2,10,"You even taught me how
"
,,
2,10,"to dance just in time for the prom.
"
,,
2,10,"Peter, you start like this.
"
,,
2,10,"Like this?
"
,,
2,10,"Yeah. Now add a little turn
"
,,
2,10,"and do a buck and wing.
"
,,
2,10,"Come on, Mr. Fargas,
"
,,
2,10,"do the whole darn thing.
"
,,
2,10,"Jeez, Mr. Fargas, what happened to you?
"
,,
2,10,"Somebody give you a fun-ectomy?
"
,,
2,10,"No, they gave me these
"
,,
2,10,"by order of the School Board.
"
,,
2,10,"They said it evens me out.
"
,,
2,10,"Sorry to fly off the handle.
"
,,
2,10,"Here, let me see that.
"
,,
2,10,"That's what l think about you taking
"
,,
2,10,"chill pills from the Man.
"
,,
2,10,"Look, the old Farg made learning fun.
"
,,
2,10,"He's what these kids need.
"
,,
2,10,"Now get back in that classroom
"
,,
2,10,"and teach your ""Fargin""' ass off.
"
,,
2,10,"Don't come in! Just a minute!
"
,,
2,10,"Chris, your mother wants me and you
"
,,
2,10,"to have a talk.
"
,,
2,10,"No!
"
,,
2,10,"l was going for a new record.
"
,,
2,10,"Now, son, as men, it's only natural for us
"
,,
2,10,"to look at naked girls.
"
,,
2,10,"Every man does it, even Mr. Rogers.
"
,,
2,10,"Hello, neighbor.
"
,,
2,10,"But peeping can be dangerous,
"
,,
2,10,"so l brought you this.
"
,,
2,10," Wow! Miss December!
"
,,
2,10," Yep, the old skin bin.
"
,,
2,10,"Now you can look at naked girls
"
,,

"
,,
2,10,"Wow, check out the rack on.... Mom?
"
,,
2,10,"Give me that!
"
,,
2,10,"Just a little present your mom gave me

"
,,
2,10,"Hey, Dad. Thanks.
"
,,
2,10,"Mom, if you get elected
"
,,
2,10,"can you fix it so l win Homecoming Queen?
"
,,
2,10,"Honey, of course l can.
"
,,
2,10,"But winning without honor
"
,,
2,10,"isn't really winning at all.
"
,,
2,10," lsn't that right, Milli?
"
,,
2,10," No, it's just as good.
"
,,
2,10,"""Baby""
"

"
,,
2,10,"Welcome back, Fargas.
"
,,
2,10,"Oh, my God. He's gonna wipe
"
,,
2,10,"that species off the face of the earth!
"
,,
2,10,"No, Lois. The janitor'll do that.
"
,,
2,10,"I'm getting word
"
,,
2,10,"that the Quahog SchooI Board...
"
,,
2,10,"...has just dismissed RandaII Fargas,
"
,,
2,10,"ending his 32-year teaching career,
"
,,
2,10," What? They can't do that!
"
,,
2,10," Peter, the man is obviously unbalanced.
"
,,
2,10,"In other news, Betsy Lebeau,
"
,,
2,10,"SchooI Board President candidate...
"
,,
2,10,"...announced today she's puIIing out

2,10,"Lois Griffin, running unopposed,
"
,,
2,10,"My goodness! l win by default!
"
,,
2,10,"Great. You can get Mr. Fargas his job back.
"
,,
2,10,"l'm sorry! But l do have a mind of my own!
"
,,
2,10,"And l happen to agree
"
,,
2,10,"with the School Board's decision.
"
,,
2,10,"l know you're a feminist
"
,,
2,10,"and l think that's adorable...
"
,,
2,10,"...but this is grown-up time
"
,,
2,10,"and l'm the man.
"
,,
2,10,"l'm not giving that lunatic his job back
"
,,
2,10,"and that's final.
"
,,
2,10,"Lois, l can't let you deprive our children
"
,,
2,10,"of a fine teacher like Mr. Fargas.
"
,,
2,10,"l'm gonna stop you the only way l can...
"
,,
2,10,"...by killing you...
"
,,
2,10,"...in the race for School Board President!
"
,,
2,10,"Peter, are you sure running against Lois
"
,,
2,10,"is such a good idea?
"
,,
2,10,"You know how competitive you get.
"
,,
2,10,"l can be just as non-competitive
"
,,
2,10,"as anybody.
"
,,
2,10,"Matter of fact,
"
,,
2,10,"l'm the most non-competitive. So l win.
"
,,
2,10,"Come on, you can't even handle
"
,,
2,10,"losing at checkers.
"
,,
2,10,"King me.
"
,,
2,10,"Look over there!
"
,,
2,10,"What?
"
,,
2,10,"Peter, since when do you care
"
,,
2,10,"about the School Board?
"
,,
2,10,"Lois, Mr. Fargas is getting a bum rap...
"
,,
2,10,"...and if running against you
"
,,
2,10,"is the only way to get him back...
"
,,
2,10,"...then l am gonna run
"
,,
2,10,"like the Six Million Dollar Man.
"
,,
2,10,"We can rebuild him.
"
,,
2,10,"We have the technology,
"
,,
2,10,"but l don't want to spend a lot of money.
"
,,
2,10,"Fine, if you feel that strongly,
"
,,
2,10,"then by all means run.
"
,,
2,10,"But l'm warning you, l'm not gonna
"
,,
2,10,"pull any punches on the issues.
"
,,
2,10,"l'm Lois.
"
,,
2,10,"Look at me with my big ideas
"
,,
2,10,"and my pointy nose,
"
,,
2,10,"This'll be even easier
"
,,
2,10,"than running unopposed.
"
,,
2,10,"ls that so?
"
,,
2,10,"Not only am l gonna win this election...
"
,,
2,10,"...l am gonna eat your nose.
"

"
,,
2,10,"Oh, my. Look where my hand is.
"
,,
2,10,"I say, Iook where my hand is!
"
,,
2,10,"It's in a very naughty pIace,
"
,,
2,10,"Does that not disgust you?
"
,,
2,10,"You're talking to a guy
"
,,
2,10,"who uses his tongue for toilet paper.
"
,,
2,10,"Now look here, you loathsome cur!
"
,,
2,10,"The matron of prattle
"
,,
2,10,"has left me in your ward.
"
,,
2,10,"You should be striving to thwart
"
,,
2,10,"my noisome misdeeds.
"
,,
2,10,"Look at me.
"
,,
2,10,"l'm writing profanity on the wall!

2,10,"Water-soluble.

2,10,"Yes, that's it. That's quite good.

2,10,"Mr. Fargas back in the classroom?
"
,,
2,10,"Who?
"
,,
2,10,"Peter, l cared about our schools.
"
,,
2,10,"All you cared about
"
,,
2,10,"was some stupid competition.
"
,,
2,10,"Winning was only half the battle.
"
,,
2,10,"lf you blow this chance to do something
"
,,
2,10,"good for our kids...
"
,,
2,10,"...you'll be the biggest loser!
"
,,
2,10,"Oh, yeah?
"
,,
2,10,"Peter Griffin is no loser!
"
,,
2,10,"When l'm through with our schools...
"
,,
2,10,"...our students'll be so smart
"
,,
2,10,"they'll be able to program their VCRs...
"
,,
2,10,"...without spilling piping hot gravy
"
,,
2,10,"all over myself.
"
,,
2,10,"This is Trisha Takanawa, here
"
,,
2,10,"with School Board President Peter Griffin.
"
,,
2,10,"Mr. President, you've accomplished
"
,,
2,10,"so much in just a few short weeks.
"
,,
2,10,"Thanks, Connie. l'm very excited about
"
,,
2,10,"our progress in revamping our schools.
"
,,
2,10,"For starters,
"
,,
2,10,"we're making sex education more fun.
"
,,
2,10,"""Vagina junction, what's your function?
"
,,
2,10,"""Taking in sperm and spitting out babies""
"
,,
2,10,"And our schools are the safest around...
"
,,
2,10,"...thanks to the hall monitor XL-K.
"
,,
2,10,"HaIt! Present haII pass!
"
,,
2,10,"Right here.
"
,,
2,10,"Second request, Present pass,
"
,,
2,10,"But.... Right here!
"
,,
2,10,"Security breach!
"
,,
2,10,"l guess Little Miss Free Spirit will think
"
,,
2,10,"twice before roaming the halls.
"
,,
2,10,"l've restocked our school library...
"
,,
2,10,"...with books of some
"
,,
2,10,"of our greatest movies and TV shows.
"
,,
2,10,"Because if we don't teach our kids to read,
"
,,
2,10,"how will they ever know what's on?
"
,,
2,10,"Mr. Griffin, this is impressive.
"
,,
2,10,"l've never seen kids
"
,,
2,10,"so enthusiastic about reading.
"
,,
2,10,"Thank you. That's what you voted for.
"
,,
2,10,"Hey, son, show the folks at home
"
,,
2,10,"what you got there.
"
,,
2,10,"Good Lord! That's a dirty magazine!
"
,,
2,10,"That's mine.... Shaft.
"
,,
2,10,"There might be a mineshaft
"
,,
2,10,"under this library.
"
,,
2,10,"All these kids are looking at pornography!
"
,,
2,10,"What kind of pervert
"
,,
2,10,"gave you kids this filth?
"
,,
2,10,"Chris Griffin. He got it from his dad.
"
,,
2,10,"There's quite a crowd outside.
"
,,
2,10,"l haven't witnessed pandemonium like this
"
,,
2,10,"since Ridiculous Day down at the deli...
"
,,
2,10,"...when prices were so low
"
,,
2,10,"they were ridiculous.
"
,,
2,10,"You said it, pally.
"
,,
2,10,"That's why l brought in the big guns.
"
,,
2,10,"Say ""how do"" to the Ragin' Cajun,
"
,,
2,10,"Mr. James Carville.
"
,,
2,10,"Oh, God. Oh, jeez!
"
,,
2,10,"Did somebody open
"
,,
2,10,"the Ark of the Covenant?
"
,,
2,10,"Now see, Peter, what you gotta do is
"
,,
2,10,"you gotta declare war! War!
"
,,
2,10,"Your only chance
"
,,
2,10,"of surviving this scandal...
"
,,
2,10,"...is to claim that Lois
"
,,
2,10,"gave your boy the pornography.
"
,,
2,10,"And he's right.
"
,,
2,10,"Pin it on the old ball and chain.
"
,,
2,10,"l can't do that.
"
,,
2,10,"Lois is mad enough at me without....
"
,,
2,10,"l'm sorry. l can't look at you!
"
,,
2,10,"l mean, l can handle ugly.
"
,,
2,10,"But this is like circus ugly.
"
,,
2,10,"Lois, l need your help. You gotta come
"
,,
2,10,"to my press conference this afternoon.
"
,,
2,10,"Lois, l could lose my presidency!
"
,,
2,10,"Too bad! l've already lost more than that!
"
,,
2,10,"Not my rainbow socks
"
,,
2,10,"with the individual toes?
"
,,
2,10,"No. l've lost my respect for you.
"
,,
2,10,"Because l need those socks.
"
,,
2,10,"We now take you live
"
,,
2,10,"to Peter Griffin Junior High...
"
,,
2,10,"...where embattled School Board President

"
,,
2,10,"l thought you were mad at Dad.
"
,,
2,10,"l am.
"
,,
2,10,"l just came to see him twist in the wind.
"
,,
2,10,"Are you and Dad gonna get a divorce?
"
,,
2,10,"Oh, honey. Maybe.
"
,,
2,10,"""A parent giving porno to their kid

,,
2,10,"Crap, Look, my wife, Lois, is the most
"
,,
2,10,"important person in the worId to me,
"
,,
2,10,"I gave my son those magazines,
"
,,
2,10,"Even worse, I turned a beautifuI gift from
"
,,
2,10,"Lois into something cheap and tawdry,
"
,,
2,10,"I just wanted to win so bad,
"
,,
2,10,"Now I know that some things
"
,,
2,10,"are more important than winning,
"
,,
2,10,"Lois, I onIy hope you can find it
"
,,
2,10,"in your heart to forgive me,
"
,,
2,10,"Oh, Peter!
"
,,
2,10,"So you're saying you're not only
"

2,10,"a bad father, but a bad husband, too?
"
,,
2,10,"Have you the moral authority to lead?
"
,,
2,10,"Yes. No. And, screw it. l resign.
"

2,10,"There's the President,

"
,,
2,10,"And so ends a dark and shameful chapter

"
,,
2,10,"How much moral bankruptcy and
"

2,10,"Much obliged.

"
,,
2,11," Here I am. Sorry, I...
"
,,
2,11," Camera two.
"
,,
2,11," Sorry, I overslept.
"
,,
2,11," Yes, well, do you want breakfast?
"
,,
2,11,"Or would you rather
"
,,
2,11,"chew on your own ass, as usual?
"
,,
2,11,"Well, I'm... I'm sure
"
,,
2,11,"you have something to say to that, hm?
"
,,
2,11,"Oh. Oh, God, sorry. Can you give me the line
"
,,
2,11,"again? Not the whole line, just the end of it.
"
,,
2,11,"Oh! Let's cut. All right,
"
,,
2,11,"you're sleeping with which producer?
"
,,
2,11,"God, as soon as my movie deal
"
,,
2,11,"kicks in, I am such a ghost!
"
,,
2,11,"It seems today that all you see
"
,,
2,11,"Is violence in movies and sex on TV
"
,,
2,11,"But where are those
"
,,
2,11,"good old-fashioned values
"
,,
2,11,"On which we used to rely?
"
,,
2,11,"Lucky there's a family guy
"
,,
2,11,"Lucky there's a man who positively
"
,,
2,11,"can do all the things that make us
"
,,
2,11,"Laugh and cry
"
,,
2,11,"He's a family guy!
"
,,
2,11,"Peter, take off your blindfold.
"
,,
2,11,"We're almost there.
"
,,
2,11,"Not yet. I don't wanna
"
,,
2,11,"ruin my birthday surprise.
"
,,
2,11,"Then at least let me drive!
"
,,
2,11,"You know it's illegal for women to drive.
"
,,
2,11,"A woman driving! That's adorable.
"
,,
2,11,"Peter, I don't think...
"
,,
2,11,"Peter, please, I'm begging you, stop the car!
"
,,
2,11,"Oh, we're here. Thank God.
"
,,
2,11,"Whoo!
"
,,
2,11,"Bob's Funland and Putt Putt Golf! The
"
,,
2,11,"grown-up in me likes the prospect of fun.
"
,,
2,11,"But the kid in me is suicidal
"
,,
2,11,"over what a fat bastard I'll become.
"
,,
2,11," Happy birthday!
"
,,
2,11," I can't believe it! Quagmire, Cleveland, Joe!
"
,,
2,11," Who are you?
"
,,
2,11," The guy whose car you just slammed into!
"
,,
2,11,"Lois, you invited everyone!
"
,,
2,11,"Excuse me, excuse me. My friend is
"
,,
2,11,"differently-abled. May he go ahead of you?
"
,,
2,11,"Of course.
"
,,
2,11,"Frontsies, backsies, backsies, backsies.
"
,,
2,11,"Well, hello! You must be
"
,,
2,11,"this beautiful to ride the Quagmire.
"
,,
2,11," Careful, Joe.
"
,,
2,11," Kiss off! Yeah!
"
,,
2,11,"Your father! Sometimes I don't think he'll
"
,,
2,11,"be happy until he's completely paralysed.
"
,,
2,11,"Ooh! How deliciously evil-Iooking.
"
,,
2,11,"It's like something out of Stephen King.
"
,,
2,11,"OK, for my 307th book,
"
,,
2,11,"uh, this couple is attacked by a... a...
"
,,
2,11,"A lamp monster! Ooh! Ooooh!
"
,,
2,11,"You're not even trying any more, are you?
"
,,
2,11,"When can I have it?
"
,,
2,11,"A lot.
"
,,
2,11,"A 10-gauge. I've never handled
"
,,
2,11,"one of these before.
"
,,
2,11,"Agh!
"
,,
2,11,"Ah! Yes!
"
,,
2,11,"This is my rifle, this is my gun
"
,,
2,11,"This is for fighting, this is for fun
"
,,
2,11,"Oh, dang. Now I hate windmills even more.
"
,,
2,11,"Let me give you a tip, pally.
"
,,
2,11,"The shortest distance between two points
"
,,
2,11,"is the full-body-English
"
,,
2,11,"high-arcing rainbow shot.
"
,,
2,11,"I know what you're thinkin'.
"
,,
2,11,"Sir, I'm gonna have to ask
"
,,
2,11,"you and your party to leave.
"
,,
2,11,"You've caused nothing but trouble.
"
,,
2,11,"Perhaps we should just continue the party
"
,,
2,11,"at some other type of location.
"
,,
2,11,"No, no, no, wait. I know this guy.
"
,,
2,11,"We went to high school together.
"
,,
2,11," We did?
"
,,
2,11," Yeah.
"
,,
2,11,"He was a loser then, and he's a loser now.
"
,,
2,11,"Oh, we used to kid this guy all the time.
"
,,
2,11,"Bob misses his mommy!
"
,,
2,11,"Bob misses his mommy!
"
,,
2,11,"So we're not goin' just cos some little pissant
"
,,
2,11,"tells us to. I demand to see the owner.
"
,,
2,11,"That's me. I'm Bob Funland.
"
,,
2,11,"Wha... You own this whole place?!
"
,,
2,11,"That's right. This place is my legacy. So
"
,,
2,11,"what have you done with your life, you jerk?
"
,,
2,11,"Uh... Uh...
"
,,
2,11,"I'm Neptune, god of the sea!
"
,,
2,11,"I sink ships and conjure up storms!
"
,,
2,11,"No, you're not. I am.
"
,,
2,11,"And you know nothing of my work.
"
,,
2,11,"Look at this, Lois. See, right here.
"
,,
2,11,"I was voted Most Likely to Succeed.
"
,,
2,11,"Peter, that's not you. That's not even
"
,,
2,11,"a yearbook, it's a People Magazine. 
"
,,
2,11,"Oh. I wondered why they had
"
,,
2,11,"the wrong picture and name.
"
,,
2,11,"Can't we just enjoy the rest of your birthday?
"
,,
2,11,"Look. It says
"
,,
2,11,"""Happy birthday, Daddy. Love, Stewie.""
"
,,
2,11,"Let me see that!
"
,,
2,11,"Did you forge my name?! Oh, is that
"
,,
2,11,"backward ""S"" supposed to be cute?
"
,,
2,11,"I'm going to crap double for you tonight!
"
,,
2,11,"Face it, Lois, I'm a nobody.
"
,,
2,11,"Why can't I be famous like Bob?
"
,,
2,11,"Or my cousin, Kathy Griffin?
"
,,
2,11,"Then I got on Suddenly Susan, 
"
,,
2,11,"and that was, like, really cool.
"
,,
2,11,"I still do stand-up, people laugh
"
,,
2,11,"and give me money, that's also cool.
"
,,
2,11,"Isn't this great, catching up? Anyway...
"
,,
2,11," She's still talking.
"
,,
2,11," I don't get it. I poured it in her drink.
"
,,
2,11,"...name was Steve Rock.
"
,,
2,11,"First black I ever did it with.
"
,,
2,11," Oh, boy.
"
,,
2,11," ""Never go back."" But I went everywhere.
"
,,
2,11,"Don't be depressed, Dad.
"
,,
2,11,"Here, I made you a present.
"
,,
2,11,"My God! It's... good. Really good.
"
,,
2,11,"It's partly an expression of my teenage angst,
"
,,
2,11,"but mostly it's a moo-cow.
"
,,
2,11,"It's lovely, Chris.
"
,,
2,11,"Go ahead, Peter, make a wish.
"
,,
2,11,"I'd sell my soul to be famous!
"
,,
2,11,"Hup. I got a live one. Peter Griffin.
"
,,
2,11,"Ooh, sorry, chief. Seems he already
"
,,
2,11,"sold his soul in 1976 for Bee Gees tickets.
"
,,
2,11,"Oh, and again in 1981 for half a Mallomar.
"
,,
2,11,"Aw, heck! Where's a lawyer when I need one?
"
,,
2,11,"Don't forget this.
"
,,
2,11,"Maybe you could hang it in your office.
"
,,
2,11,"Son, I'll put it someplace
"
,,
2,11,"where everyone can see it.
"
,,
2,11,"Excuse me. I'll give you $1,000
"
,,
2,11,"for what you have in the back there.
"
,,
2,11,"$1,000 for a bumper sticker?
"
,,
2,11,"No, no, no. I mean that painting.
"
,,
2,11,"I must have it for my gallery in SoHo.
"
,,
2,11," I'll give you $5,000. What do you say?
"
,,
2,11," I say...
"
,,
2,11,"I love you, you freakin' son of mine! I got
"
,,
2,11,"But I painted that just for you.
"
,,
2,11,"Don't feel bad, Chris. I didn't even want it.
"
,,
2,11,"Now we all get a free trip to New York
"
,,
2,11,"cos Mr Monatti thinks
"
,,
2,11,"you could be a famous artist.
"
,,
2,11," Monatti? Antonio Monatti?
"
,,
2,11," You've heard of this man?
"
,,
2,11,"Oh, oh, oh! He's only
"
,,
2,11,"the biggest art dealer in New York!
"
,,
2,11,"I met him when I was hanging out
"
,,
2,11,"with Andy Warhol in the '70s.
"
,,
2,11,"Peter, we are not going to New York.
"
,,
2,11,"Lois, our son has been
"
,,
2,11,"blessed with a great gift,
"
,,
2,11,"and I'm gonna do everything I can
"
,,
2,11,"to nurture that talent and help him succeed.
"
,,
2,11,"Then I'll use him to live out
"
,,
2,11,"all my frustrated hopes and dreams,
"
,,
2,11,"because that's good parenting,
"
,,
2,11,"right, Bing Crosby?
"
,,
2,11,"Right, Peter.
"
,,
2,11,"And if your kids give you any lip,
"
,,
2,11,"you can beat 'em with
"
,,
2,11,"a sack of sweet Valencia oranges.
"
,,
2,11,"They won't leave a bruise, and they'll let 'em
"
,,
2,11,"know who's boss. There's no doubt about it.
"
,,
2,11," But that doesn't sound right.
"
,,
2,11," Are you givin' me lip, boy?
"
,,
2,11,"I'll take this belt off and put the smack-down
"
,,
2,11,"on you. Is that what you want? Huh?
"
,,
2,11," Hey! Hey! What... Ow! Knock it off!
"
,,
2,11," Huh?
"
,,
2,11," Like that, huh?
"
,,
2,11," Get away from me, you dead crooner.
"
,,
2,11,"Hi, this is David Leisure. You probably
"
,,
2,11,"remember me as the neighbour
"
,,
2,11,"from TV's ""Empty Nest"". 
"
,,
2,11,"No? Well, how about those car commercials
"
,,
2,11,"when I played Joe Isuzu? 
"
,,
2,11,"The... the guy who lied? 
"
,,
2,11,"Oh, come on! Those were really popular. 
"
,,
2,11,"They ran all the time. 
"
,,
2,11,"All right, look. Just buckle up. 
"
,,
2,11,"Can I get my cheque now? 
"
,,
2,11,"Oh, kids, look at that man over there, grabbin'
"
,,
2,11,"his own crotch. Oh! So alive, this city!
"
,,
2,11," Look! Central Park!
"
,,
2,11," There's the Empire State Building!
"
,,
2,11," There's a hot-dog cart!
"
,,
2,11," Chris, don't spoil your appetite.
"
,,
2,11,"New York has some of the best restaurants in
"
,,
2,11,"the world. They even have Indian food here.
"
,,
2,11,"Not the ""ub-ub"" kind, the ""mm-mm"" kind.
"
,,
2,11," Welcome to the Big Apple, fella.
"
,,
2,11," Just make sure
"
,,
2,11,"there's a Wall Street Journal
"
,,
2,11,"by the changing table.
"
,,
2,11,"And send a masseuse up. Legitimate!
"
,,
2,11,"Hey, waiter. The name's Peter Griffin.
"
,,
2,11,"My son's gonna be the best thing
"
,,
2,11,"to happen to New York
"
,,
2,11,"since Mayor Giuliani
"
,,
2,11,"had all the homeless secretly killed.
"
,,
2,11,"And all I gotta do is paint!
"
,,
2,11,"Hey, you guys have any bellhops
"
,,
2,11,"that are rats, like the Muppets?
"
,,
2,11,"Mom, can we go
"
,,
2,11,"see a Broadway play tonight?
"
,,
2,11,"Count me out. I'm never going
"
,,
2,11,"to the theatre with Peter again.
"
,,
2,11,"Remember when you were younger,
"
,,
2,11,"Uncle Vanya used to spend whole nights
"
,,
2,11,"translating books for you.
"
,,
2,11,"Uncle Vanya and I worked without rest,
"
,,
2,11,"afraid to spend a kopeck on ourselves.
"
,,
2,11,"What the hell is this?
"
,,
2,11,"For cryin' out loud, somebody throw a pie!
"
,,
2,11,"Screw the theatre. Mr Monatti invited us to a
"
,,
2,11,"cocktail party so Chris can meet some artists.
"
,,
2,11,"It's at the Museum of Modern Art. Oh, God.
"
,,
2,11,"I hope that's not some kind of museum.
"
,,
2,11," Mapplethorpe? Not just photography?
"
,,
2,11," Oh, no. Early on he did caricatures.
"
,,
2,11,"Uh, OK, Tim.
"
,,
2,11,"Who's your favourite sports star?
"
,,
2,11," Uh, Reggie Jackson.
"
,,
2,11," OK.
"
,,
2,11,"I'll draw him pooping
"
,,
2,11,"on your chest. What number is he?
"
,,
2,11,"Welcome. Chris, there are a number
"
,,
2,11,"of artists here I'd like you to meet.
"
,,
2,11,"Hey, hey, hey. Let's talk turkey, Monatti.
"
,,
2,11,"We've been here all day,
"
,,
2,11,"and Chris isn't a famous artist yet.
"
,,
2,11,"Creating art takes
"
,,
2,11,"a lot of training and technique.
"
,,
2,11," All the great artists I knew took classes.
"
,,
2,11," Even Walt Disney?
"
,,
2,11,"Do I... do I have to?
"
,,
2,11,"You want to be a star, don't you?
"
,,
2,11,"Then take it off!
"
,,
2,11,"Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's nice.
"
,,
2,11,"Art school? We don't have that kind of time.
"
,,
2,11,"Chris, give me your ear.
"
,,
2,11," Peter!
"
,,
2,11," Mr Griffin, please.
"
,,
2,11,"Please, I invited you so that Chris could
"
,,
2,11,"make an impression on the art community.
"
,,
2,11,"Why not do some sightseeing? If you leave
"
,,
2,11,"Chris in my hands, the name Griffin
"
,,
2,11," Will be as well-known as Kandinsky.
"
,,
2,11," Who?
"
,,
2,11," Rembrandt?
"
,,
2,11," Who?
"
,,
2,11," Da Vinci?
"
,,
2,11," Who?
"
,,
2,11," Bazooka Joe?
"
,,
2,11," There you go.
"
,,
2,11,"Ah, the United Nations!
"
,,
2,11,"Oh, I wish Chris could see this.
"
,,
2,11,"Isn't it inspiring how so many
"
,,
2,11,"different cultures can come together?
"
,,
2,11,"Yeah, and use up
"
,,
2,11,"all the towels in the men's room.
"
,,
2,11," Peter!
"
,,
2,11," Sorry.
"
,,
2,11," These things never get 'em completely dry.
"
,,
2,11," Where's Stewie?
"
,,
2,11,"Hm! Hidden missile silos
"
,,
2,11,"behind the Great Wall.
"
,,
2,11,"Ancient Chinese secret, huh?
"
,,
2,11,"Mr Monatti, shouldn't I be painting now?
"
,,
2,11,"Trust me, painting is the least important
"
,,
2,11,"thing about being a successful artist.
"
,,
2,11,"You need an image!
"
,,
2,11,"Let's take this Rhode Island lump of clay
"
,,
2,11," And turn it into the toast of New York!
"
,,
2,11," Ha, ha, ha! I love toast!
"
,,
2,11," Cut it and tint it green, the colour of money.
"
,,
2,11," And boogers!
"
,,
2,11,"I feel we've been walkin' in circles.
"
,,
2,11,"I don't know how you can find anything
"
,,
2,11,"in this city. It's so confusing.
"
,,
2,11,"Well, I bet if Hillary Clinton
"
,,
2,11,"becomes senator, she'll straighten it out.
"
,,
2,11,"Even though she couldn't straighten out Bill.
"
,,
2,11,"Ha, ha, ha!
"
,,
2,11,"I love when you use topical humour.
"
,,
2,11,"It's just like watching Murphy Brown. 
"
,,
2,11,"Hey, Murphy. Blah, blah, blah,
"
,,
2,11,"blah, blah, blah, John Sununu.
"
,,
2,11,"Murphy. Blah, blah, blah, blah,
"
,,
2,11,"blah, blah, Tipper Gore.
"
,,
2,11,"Hey, Murph. You can't blah, blah,
"
,,
2,11,"blah, blah, blah, blah, blah the Ayatollah.
"
,,
2,11,"Blah, blah, blah,
"
,,
2,11,"Bishop Desmond Tutu. Blah, blah.
"
,,
2,11,"Shouldn't my mom and dad be here by now?
"
,,
2,11,"They'd rather wander through SoHo,
"
,,
2,11,"looking for an address that doesn't exist.
"
,,
2,11,"Ha, ha, ha! That's my dad!
"
,,
2,11,"Well, maybe tomorrow, we could all...
"
,,
2,11," Oh, there's Kate Moss.
"
,,
2,11," Where? I don't see her.
"
,,
2,11,"Agh! Are you the Matrix?
"
,,
2,11," Kate, this is my new discovery, Christobel.
"
,,
2,11," My name's Chris.
"
,,
2,11,"Not any more. Christobel
"
,,
2,11,"will look better in Interview magazine.
"
,,
2,11,"Nice to meet you. I love artists.
"
,,
2,11,"Whoops! A crack in the floor.
"
,,
2,11," Lois. Gimme a penny,
"
,,
2,11," You're not gonna throw it over the edge?
"
,,
2,11,"No. Yes.
"
,,
2,11,"I've just scheduled your first exhibit!
"
,,
2,11,"Wow! I can't wait to tell my dad.
"
,,
2,11,"Yes. I know how important
"
,,
2,11,"your success is to your father.
"
,,
2,11,"That's why he'll understand
"
,,
2,11,"that you can never see him again.
"
,,
2,11,"Yeah. Of course he will. Dad's very...
"
,,
2,11,"Whaaaat?
"
,,
2,11,"Christobel, the art world
"
,,
2,11,"is a place of culture and breeding.
"
,,
2,11,"Your father is, uh...
"
,,
2,11,"How can I say this without upsetting you?
"
,,
2,11," Your dad is a pig!
"
,,
2,11," Ah! Ha, ha, ha!
"
,,
2,11,"So, you see, it's up to you, son. If you don't
"
,,
2,11,"wanna disappoint your father, keep him away.
"
,,
2,11,"There's my boy! Hey, come on, Chris.
"
,,
2,11,"Let's go to Barneys and fart in the suits.
"
,,
2,11,"All right, Dad! I... Oh.
"
,,
2,11," I mean, uh... I can't see you any more.
"
,,
2,11," What are you talkin' about? You're my son.
"
,,
2,11,"Mr Griffin, he's going to be a great artist.
"
,,
2,11,"He now belongs to the public.
"
,,
2,11,"And apparently, I'm dating Kate Moss.
"
,,
2,11,"Oh, and, um, don't say anything bad
"
,,
2,11,"about her, cos she might be here right now.
"
,,
2,11,"Wait a minute! You can't...
"
,,
2,11,"you can't just push me aside.
"
,,
2,11,"I made you! And I can destroy you!
"
,,
2,11,"Damn, they musta put it in the wrong baby.
"
,,
2,11,"Oh, Bobby Williams,
"
,,
2,11,"I'd love to go out with you.
"
,,
2,11,"I can't believe Chris. If I hadn't used
"
,,
2,11,"his painting to patch that window,
"
,,
2,11," He'd still be in that dump in Quahog.
"
,,
2,11," That ""dump"" is our home.
"
,,
2,11,"""Dump""? Oh, so now
"
,,
2,11,"you're too good for us, too?
"
,,
2,11,"This is a once-in-a-lifetime
"
,,
2,11,"opportunity for Chris, not you.
"
,,
2,11," Are you so selfish you can't see that?
"
,,
2,11," Yes, I am.
"
,,
2,11,"Peter, your son is using
"
,,
2,11,"his talents to pursue his dream.
"
,,
2,11,"I have no son. Except for Stewie.
"
,,
2,11," And Meg!
"
,,
2,11," Aah!
"
,,
2,11,"I had a dream
"
,,
2,11,"It's all about you
"
,,
2,11,"Meg Griffin
"
,,
2,11,"Not much you can do
"
,,
2,11,"Meg Griffin
"
,,
2,11,"You can't dance, you can't sing
"
,,
2,11,"No, you pretty much can't do a thing
"
,,
2,11,"Never fear, Daddy's here
"
,,
2,11,"Honey, you're gonna
"
,,
2,11,"make our name famous
"
,,
2,11,"You'll be larger than life
"
,,
2,11,"I'll be proud you fell out of my wife
"
,,
2,11,"You'll be known far and wide
"
,,
2,11,"Like that princess who died
"
,,
2,11,"I'm gonna make you famous
"
,,
2,11,"Wait and see
"
,,
2,11,"Honey, I'm gonna do this for you
"
,,
2,11,"But it's really for meee...
"
,,
2,11,"...eeee!
"
,,
2,11,"Fine. If Chris doesn't need me,
"
,,
2,11,"I don't need him.
"
,,
2,11,"You'll love being famous, Meg,
"
,,
2,11,"and this is the town to do it in.
"
,,
2,11,"I don't know, Dad. What am I gonna do?
"
,,
2,11,"Everybody's good at somethin'. It's just a
"
,,
2,11,"matter of findin' the special hidden talent.
"
,,
2,11,"But promise me, when you make it big,
"
,,
2,11,"you'll let me take advantage of all the...
"
,,
2,11,"I can't think of anything.
"
,,
2,11,"I guess I don't have any talent.
"
,,
2,11,"Come on, think harder!
"
,,
2,11,"There's gotta be somethin' you can do.
"
,,
2,11," That's amazing!
"
,,
2,11," Oh, thanks.
"
,,
2,11,"I roomed with Scott Hamilton at prep school.
"
,,
2,11," Nothing happened.
"
,,
2,11," No, the bird came when Meg whistled.
"
,,
2,11,"Oh. No, those are just my bird calls.
"
,,
2,11,"Do it again! Do it again!
"
,,
2,11,"Yeah? Well, what d'you want?
"
,,
2,11," Uh...
"
,,
2,11," You called me, right?
"
,,
2,11,"Oh, no, no. I wasn't calling you.
"
,,
2,11,"Oh, oh, this is funny to you? Yeah?
"
,,
2,11,"You know what a pain in the ass it is
"
,,
2,11,"to get across town, this time of day? Huh?
"
,,
2,11,"Listen, uh, mister,
"
,,
2,11,"we don't want any trouble here.
"
,,
2,11,"I don't fly, you know.
"
,,
2,11,"I take the subway like everybody else.
"
,,
2,11,"Oh, and people don't stare.
"
,,
2,11,"You make me puke. Bitch.
"
,,
2,11,"Mr Monatti, I don't feel like painting.
"
,,
2,11,"I wanna see my dad.
"
,,
2,11,"Listen, Christobel. I've sunk $5,000
"
,,
2,11,"turning you into a New York bohemian.
"
,,
2,11,"All you have to do is paint. Now get busy!
"
,,
2,11,"I have to go oil up and start squeezing
"
,,
2,11,"into my leather pants. Excuse me.
"
,,
2,11,"Oh, jeez. Kate, what should I do?
"
,,
2,11,"I don't know. You're the flavour of the month.
"
,,
2,11,"Oops! Window open.
"
,,
2,11," I'm goin' over there. I'm gonna...
"
,,
2,11," No, no.
"
,,
2,11," I'm gonna go over there and punch her.
"
,,
2,11," No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.
"
,,
2,11,"This is humiliating!
"
,,
2,11,"It's show business, baby.
"
,,
2,11,"You gotta start somewhere.
"
,,
2,11,"No, I don't. I quit.
"
,,
2,11,"Now, wait just a minute, young lady.
"
,,
2,11,"Don't you walk away from me.
"
,,
2,11,"Hey! Hey! Don't you start runnin'!
"
,,
2,11,"Wait! Meg! Meg, get off that bus.
"
,,
2,11,"Don't... don't you go to LaGuardia!
"
,,
2,11,"Meg? Meg, listen to me.
"
,,
2,11,"Don't you dare get on that plane.
"
,,
2,11,"Don't shell out five bucks for headphones
"
,,
2,11,"for Magnolia.  OK. Now, I'm pissed.
"
,,
2,11," Well, thank God that's over.
"
,,
2,11," Yeah.
"
,,
2,11," Wanna go crap on the Statue of Liberty?
"
,,
2,11," I've lived my life here and never been there.
"
,,
2,11," I've never been to the Empire State Building.
"
,,
2,11," Boy, we're a pair.
"
,,
2,11," Aren't we?
"
,,
2,11," Unbelievable. Let's go.
"
,,
2,11," Chris!
"
,,
2,11," Hey! You guys made it!
"
,,
2,11,"Of course! We wouldn't miss your big day.
"
,,
2,11,"Wait a second. I don't see any strippers
"
,,
2,11,"passing out free tacos. Lois, you lied to me!
"
,,
2,11," Is Dad mad at me?
"
,,
2,11," Oh, he just doesn't understand.
"
,,
2,11,"I know artists have to make sacrifices, and...
"
,,
2,11,"Oh, my God! Are you Kate Moss?
"
,,
2,11,"Oh, for someone with no breasts, you've
"
,,
2,11,"done very well for yourself. Good for you!

"

2,11," How jejune!
"
,,
2,11,"Hey, that's my dad. Except for that one.
"
,,
2,11,"That's my dad if he were a cat.
"

2,11,"He's the whole reason I'm here.
"
,,
2,11,"Ladies and gentlemen,
"
,,
2,11,"I apologise for these eyesores.
"
,,
2,11,"I guess I was wrong about you.
"
,,
2,11,"You're no artist. You're just a no-talent punk.
"
,,
2,11,"Now hold on a second. You can talk
"
,,
2,11,"to my daughter that way, but not my son.
"
,,
2,11," Now, apologise.
"
,,
2,11," The hell I will.
"
,,
2,11,"You owe me for all that money
"
,,
2,11,"I invested in your worthless son.
"
,,
2,11,"All right. Well, here's
"
,,
2,11,"a little something in return.
"
,,
2,11,"Work of art? Or container
"
,,
2,11,"of crazy purple knockout gas?
"
,,
2,11,"Dad, I'm sorry I'm not gonna be
"
,,
2,11,"a famous artist you can mooch off of.
"
,,
2,11,"And I'm sorry I have no talent.
"
,,
2,11,"Ah, that's OK, kids. So I don't have
"
,,
2,11,"my name on an amusement park,
"
,,
2,11,"and maybe I'll never be famous.
"
,,
2,11,"But I got three wonderful children,
"
,,
2,11,"and a wife that loves me.
"
,,
2,11,"That's right. I guess when it comes
"
,,
2,11,"right down to it, you're a pretty lucky...
"
,,
2,11,"Oh, my sentiments exactly.
"
,,
2,11,"Come on, Griffins. Let's go home.
"
,,
2,11,"Hey, watch where you're goin'.

"
,,
2,12,"Thank you. Mm. Thank you.
"
,,
2,12,"Thank you.
"
,,
2,12,"It was 360 years ago that Quahog founder
"
,,
2,12,"Miles ""Chatterbox"" Musket set sail
"
,,
2,12,"for the new colony of Rhode Island.
"
,,
2,12,"You know what I'm gonna do when we get
"
,,
2,12,"to shore? First, I'm gonna have a snack.
"
,,
2,12,"No, no, no. Shower first, snack second.
"
,,
2,12,"I hope I see Indians!
"
,,
2,12,"Think they'll have American cheese?
"
,,
2,12,"Ever the free thinker, Miles was
"
,,
2,12,"thrown overboard for speaking his mind.
"
,,
2,12,"He was as good as dead. 
"
,,
2,12,"But, as legend has it, 
"
,,
2,12,"he was saved by a magic clam, 
"
,,
2,12,"who brought him to shore
"
,,
2,12,"and shared the vision of a new colony, 
"
,,
2,12,"which would be called Quahog. 
"
,,
2,12,"There are fields for tilling, woods for timber,
"
,,
2,12,"and always the bounty of the sea.
"
,,
2,12,"Look at all this sand! Do you know
"
,,
2,12,"there are beaches with black sand?
"
,,
2,12," Did I not pack my towel?
"
,,
2,12," Are you listening? I'm trying to help.
"
,,
2,12,"And help he did. 
"
,,
2,12,"Thanks to the clam's leadership, 
"
,,
2,12,"Quahog became a great
"
,,
2,12,"and prosperous settlement. 
"
,,
2,12,"But relations between Miles
"
,,
2,12,"and the clam soon soured. 
"
,,
2,12,"I know he's an Indian,
"
,,
2,12,"but what kind of a name is Squanto?
"
,,
2,12," Leslie or something like that would be nice.
"
,,
2,12," Shut up! Just shut up!
"
,,
2,12,"God! Keep it to yourself once in a while! Oh!
"
,,
2,12,"Here, look what I'm doing.
"
,,
2,12,"All right? Look, watch this.
"
,,
2,12,"Huh? Look. See that, see that?
"
,,
2,12,"Now try it with me. Huh? OK? OK?
"
,,
2,12,"Things only got worse. Before long, 
"
,,
2,12,"Miles began to contemplate killing the clam. 
"
,,
2,12,"I was awake last night, Miles.
"
,,
2,12,"I saw you.
"
,,
2,12,"I think it's time for me to go.
"
,,
2,12,"I'll send for my things.
"
,,
2,12,"Wait! Don't go! I'm sorry!
"
,,
2,12,"Miles never spoke again.
"
,,
2,12,"But every year until his death -
"
,,
2,12,"from a combination of tuberculosis
"
,,
2,12,"and a tomahawk to the head -
"
,,
2,12,"he went to the shore on this day
"
,,
2,12,"in hopes that the magic clam would return.
"
,,
2,12,"Today we citizens of Quahog
"
,,
2,12,"continue this tradition.
"
,,
2,12,"What's that? Something out at sea?
"
,,
2,12,"Clam ho-o-o-o!
"
,,
2,12,"They're giving your cue, Peter.
"
,,
2,12,"Whose idea was it to make
"
,,
2,12,"the suit out of foam rubber?
"
,,
2,12,"It's such an honour to play the magic clam.
"
,,
2,12,"Aren't you proud of your dad, kids?
"
,,
2,12,"Are you kidding? God, this is worse
"
,,
2,12,"than having Ronald McDonald for a father.
"
,,
2,12," Bye, Dad! Don't wait up!
"
,,
2,12," Whoa!
"
,,
2,12,"Come back here. You're not going out
"
,,
2,12,"with all that make-up on.
"
,,
2,12," But, Dad...
"
,,
2,12," Upstairs!
"
,,
2,12,"You're a McDonald, not a whore.
"
,,
2,12,"I think I got a wave here!
"
,,
2,12,"Huh. So that's what Peter's penis looks like.
"
,,
2,12,"How could you embarrass me?! Nobody
"
,,
2,12,"better pull this crap at my slumber party.
"
,,
2,12,"Don't worry. You and your friends
"
,,
2,12,"are gonna have a great time.
"
,,
2,12,"Yes, yes, how delightful it will be.
"
,,
2,12,"A pubescent herd of gabby wretches
"
,,
2,12,"prattling on about boys and music
"
,,
2,12,"and jellybeans and stickers...
"
,,
2,12,"Oh, we'd better stop by the hospital
"
,,
2,12,"so I can get my cooties shot.
"
,,
2,12,"Shut up.
"
,,
2,12,"Just leave me and my friends alone tonight.
"
,,
2,12,"Meg, will you relax? None of us
"
,,
2,12,"are gonna do anything to embarrass you.
"
,,
2,12,"Jeez, I gotta get gas.
"
,,
2,12,"Hey, any of you guys want a soda?
"
,,
2,12,"I'm gonna go inside and get a soda.
"
,,
2,12,"Mom!
"
,,
2,12,"Meg, you know your father
"
,,
2,12,"loves you very much.
"
,,
2,12," Mr Griffin?
"
,,
2,12," Oh, my God.
"
,,
2,12,"Hey, Meg, it's Kevin from next door.
"
,,
2,12,"I didn't know you worked here.
"
,,
2,12,"Hey, Kevin, come here.
"
,,
2,12,"Come here! Say hi to Meg.
"
,,
2,12,"She's right in there, right there.
"
,,
2,12,"OK, I'd put Brad Pitt's face
"
,,
2,12,"on Brendan Fraser's body
"
,,
2,12,"with Ben Affleck's butt.
"
,,
2,12,"My turn, my turn.
"
,,
2,12,"I'd take James Brolin's face,
"
,,
2,12,"Mark Spitz's body,
"
,,
2,12,"and Milton Berle's legendary genitals. Ah!
"
,,
2,12," Mom, what are you doing?
"
,,
2,12," I love slumber parties.
"
,,
2,12,"OK, truth or dare. Who here
"
,,
2,12,"has gone all the way? Hm?
"
,,
2,12,"At my sleepovers, we used to practise
"
,,
2,12,"French kissing. Now, everybody pair up.
"
,,
2,12," All right, Mom!
"
,,
2,12," Chris, get outta here right now!
"
,,
2,12," Um... I can't.
"
,,
2,12," OK, finish up and then come out.
"
,,
2,12,"Lois, have you seen my fake beard?
"
,,
2,12,"Oh, crap! I'm stuck in the stairs.
"
,,
2,12,"Oh, God, kill me now.
"
,,
2,12,"Hello.
"
,,
2,12,"Karen!
"
,,
2,12,"All right, Meg, I need you to boil some water.
"
,,
2,12,"Girls, I'm gonna need towels. Lots of 'em.
"
,,
2,12," OK, let's go.
"
,,
2,12," Oh, jeez. I'm sorry, Meg's friends.
"
,,
2,12,"Look, I'll make it up to you. I'll get you
"
,,
2,12,"Davy Jones for your school dance.
"
,,
2,12," Ow! Ah, jeez! Lois, what is that? Acid?
"
,,
2,12," You guys are ruining my life!
"
,,
2,12,"I'm sorry, honey. I know how you must feel.
"
,,
2,12,"If you care about me, you won't show
"
,,
2,12,"your faces for the rest of the night.
"
,,
2,12,"Well, then it's a good thing I have this.
"
,,
2,12,"I am not a crook.
"
,,
2,12,"Look, I mean it. All of you.
"
,,
2,12,"Oh, God, where's Stewie?
"
,,
2,12,"Well, Beth, what do you think?
"
,,
2,12,"Does Mark find you attractive?
"
,,
2,12," I don't know.
"
,,
2,12," Well, have you asked him?
"
,,
2,12,"Not exactly.
"
,,
2,12,"All right, let's try some role-playing.
"
,,
2,12,"I'll be Mark.
"
,,
2,12,"You ask me out to the box social or whatever
"
,,
2,12,"the devil it is you children do these days.
"
,,
2,12,"Peter, don't!
"
,,
2,12,"God, your hand is like ice!
"
,,
2,12,"Just here. Give it to me.
"
,,
2,12,"Ooh, that'll warm it up a little.
"
,,
2,12,"Oh, that's nice.
"
,,
2,12,"Oh! Oh! Oh!
"
,,
2,12," Peter, wait till...
"
,,
2,12," Sha... shaargh!
"
,,
2,12,"Oh, Peter.
"
,,
2,12," Argh!
"
,,
2,12," Argh!
"
,,
2,12," What happened to your friends?
"
,,
2,12," My family scared them away.
"
,,
2,12,"I wish there was some way I could make
"
,,
2,12,"them understand how embarrassing they are.
"
,,
2,12,"Welcome back to ""Diane!""
"
,,
2,12,"Erica, it's time for Mario's little confession.
"
,,
2,12,"Erica, you know I love you,
"
,,
2,12,"but I gotta come clean.
"
,,
2,12,"I'm... I'm not really a man.
"
,,
2,12,"I'm a woman.
"
,,
2,12,"Oh, my God. You're a woman?
"
,,
2,12,"Well, actually, I'm not really a woman.
"
,,
2,12,"I'm a horse.
"
,,
2,12,"Oh, my God. You're a horse?
"
,,
2,12,"Actually, I'm not really a horse.
"
,,
2,12,"I'm a broom.
"
,,
2,12,"OK, OK. So, how do you feel?
"
,,
2,12,"To be honest with you, Diane, I'm surprised.
"
,,
2,12,"Man, this is a great show. They drag these
"
,,
2,12,"idiots up on stage and then blindside 'em.
"
,,
2,12,"Like this one guy, didn't know
"
,,
2,12,"he was actually two midgets.
"
,,
2,12,"Oh, those poor, unsuspecting people.
"
,,
2,12,"Well, maybe some of them deserved it.
"
,,
2,12,"Hello, and welcome to Diane! 
"
,,
2,12,"Today's guest is tired
"
,,
2,12,"of being embarrassed by her family.
"
,,
2,12," Meg, how did you get these tickets again?
"
,,
2,12," Let's bring them up right now.
"
,,
2,12,"Whatever problems we have
"
,,
2,12,"can be settled in the privacy of...
"
,,
2,12," The Griffin family.
"
,,
2,12," Suckers.
"
,,
2,12,"Uh-oh.
"
,,
2,12,"And we're back. Griffins, do you have
"
,,
2,12,"anything to say to your daughter?
"
,,
2,12,"I can't believe you'd do this to us, Meg.
"
,,
2,12,"Maybe now I won't give you the antidote.
"
,,
2,12," To what?
"
,,
2,12," To the poison you just drank!
"
,,
2,12,"See what I mean? This is not normal.
"
,,
2,12,"You there, Bingo. It seems the naughty baby
"
,,
2,12,"has made a messy-poo in his...
"
,,
2,12,"I say, what's this? Volume. Volume!
"
,,
2,12,"Look, what's the big deal? I mean,
"
,,
2,12,"we're just a regular American family.
"
,,
2,12,"We have family dinners,
"
,,
2,12,"and we go to church...
"
,,
2,12,"Yeah, and you even manage
"
,,
2,12,"to humiliate me there.
"
,,
2,12," Whoa! Is that really the blood of Christ?
"
,,
2,12," Yes.
"
,,
2,12,"Man! That guy must've been
"
,,
2,12,"wasted 24 hours a day, huh?
"
,,
2,12,"We have a caller on the line. Go ahead.
"
,,
2,12,"Yes. Yes. I say,
"
,,
2,12,"do you have Prince Albert in a can?
"
,,
2,12,"Quiet, quiet, quiet. Shut up. Shut up.
"
,,
2,12,"Well, you'd better let him out!
"
,,
2,12,"That's hilarious!
"
,,
2,12,"Meg, you have two parents
"
,,
2,12,"who love you and...
"
,,
2,12,"What does that say under me?
"
,,
2,12,"Oh, go yourself, Diane.
"
,,
2,12,"She said a swear!
"
,,
2,12,"Peter, do you think there might be
"
,,
2,12,"any validity to what Meg is feeling?
"
,,
2,12,"Who are you callin' Uncle Tom?!
"
,,
2,12," What?
"
,,
2,12," OK, time out.
"
,,
2,12,"This kind of acrimony
"
,,
2,12,"isn't gonna resolve our differences.
"
,,
2,12,"Just shut up and throw a chair.
"
,,
2,12," OK.
"
,,
2,12," Argh!
"
,,
2,12,"Hm.
"
,,
2,12,"Uh-oh. Fire! Fire!
"
,,
2,12,"City Hall is burning!
"
,,
2,12,"Don't worry. I'll put it out.
"
,,
2,12,"Hey, great show out there.
"
,,
2,12,"If you want an autograph, you either
"
,,
2,12,"gotta give me a pen or get me some snow.
"
,,
2,12,"I look at you and I see a series.
"
,,
2,12,"We would like to put cameras in your house
"
,,
2,12,"and follow the drama that is your family.
"
,,
2,12,"Kinda like The Real World. 
"
,,
2,12,"All right! Then everyone'd get
"
,,
2,12,"to see me and my wacky antics.
"
,,
2,12,"Bleh!
"
,,
2,12," So, do we have a deal?
"
,,
2,12," Let's shake on it.
"
,,
2,12,"Mom, are we on TV right now?
"
,,
2,12,"Yes, Chris.
"
,,
2,12,"Your father signed a contract,
"
,,
2,12,"and now we're gonna be on TV
"
,,
2,12,"for the next six months.
"
,,
2,12,"How could you do this? You turned my life
"
,,
2,12,"into the 24-hour Loser Channel.
"
,,
2,12,"You! Cameraman! Make sure
"
,,
2,12,"you use that Cybill Shepherd filter.
"
,,
2,12,"If it makes her look half-human,
"
,,
2,12,"it'll take six months off my face.
"
,,
2,12,"Um...
"
,,
2,12,"I... I find the toothpaste with a pump
"
,,
2,12,"is a little easier to get on the brush.
"
,,
2,12,"Um... you might have noticed
"
,,
2,12,"my underwear has a hole in it.
"
,,
2,12,"It's... you know... I don't see
"
,,
2,12,"any reason to throw it out.
"
,,
2,12,"The waist is still fine, you know...
"
,,
2,12,"You can see it's still real stretchy.
"
,,
2,12,"Mom, you have to do something!
"
,,
2,12,"Dad's on TV parading around in his
"
,,
2,12,"underwear like some gross European guy!
"
,,
2,12,"Oh, now, sweetie,
"
,,
2,12,"your father is just a free spirit.
"
,,
2,12,"Here. A good breakfast
"
,,
2,12,"is the foundation of a good day.
"
,,
2,12,"And a bad breakfast
"
,,
2,12,"is the foundation of indigestion. Hey-oh!
"
,,
2,12,"Hi. I'm Brian.
"
,,
2,12,"What the hell is this? I said egg whites only!
"
,,
2,12,"Are you trying to give me a bloody
"
,,
2,12,"heart attack? Make it again!
"
,,
2,12,"Ah, the breakfast thing.
"
,,
2,12,"Yes. It wasn't even about the eggs, really.
"
,,
2,12,"Frankly, I like the yolks.
"
,,
2,12,"I don't... I have no problem.
"
,,
2,12,"It's just there's always been a lot
"
,,
2,12,"of tension between Lois and me,
"
,,
2,12,"and it's not so much that I want to kill her,
"
,,
2,12,"it's just I want her not to be alive any more.
"
,,
2,12,"I sometimes wonder if all women
"
,,
2,12,"are this difficult, and then I think to myself
"
,,
2,12,"""My God! Wouldn't it be marvellous
"
,,
2,12,"if I turned out to be a homosexual?""
"
,,
2,12,"One time my dad pooped in the
"
,,
2,12,"neighbours' yard, then lied about it.
"
,,
2,12,"I knew it! Well, I'm glad I used
"
,,
2,12,"his shovel to clean it up.
"
,,
2,12,"Wow! Joe, this sort of makes you
"
,,
2,12,"like Larry from Three's Company. 
"
,,
2,12,"You know, I always thought he was sexy.
"
,,
2,12,"Yes! I am all about Larry over here!
"
,,
2,12,"Um, on Sundays we generally catch
"
,,
2,12,"the early-bird special
"
,,
2,12,"here at the Lobster Shanty.
"
,,
2,12,"There's fresh seafood, good prices.
"
,,
2,12," Plus... it's a shanty.
"
,,
2,12," And you get to pick your own lobster.
"
,,
2,12,"Yes. That one looks
"
,,
2,12,"like he's got some fight in him.
"
,,
2,12,"Take off the rubber bands! I'm going in.
"
,,
2,12,"Oh, my God, it is them! I can't believe
"
,,
2,12,"the Griffins eat here like everyday people.
"
,,
2,12,"We're, like, trying to eat here.
"
,,
2,12," Meg, put your bib on.
"
,,
2,12," I don't wanna wear a bib.
"
,,
2,12,"Meg, honey, it's very cold in here. Maybe
"
,,
2,12,"you'd be more comfortable with your bib on.
"
,,
2,12," She means your nipples are stickin' out.
"
,,
2,12," Mom!
"
,,
2,12,"Nipples! Nipples!
"
,,
2,12,"That's it! I want those cameras off!
"
,,
2,12,"Fourth wall! You're breaking the fourth wall!
"
,,
2,12,"Meg, you're the one that got us
"
,,
2,12,"on TV in the first place.
"
,,
2,12,"Well, now I am getting us off TV. I quit.
"
,,
2,12,"Hm. This isn't necessarily a bad thing.
"
,,
2,12,"We can't do the show without Meg.
"
,,
2,12,"Why not? Our research shows that Meg
"
,,
2,12,"is the least popular character on the show.
"
,,
2,12,"But everyone loves the rest of you. Lois,
"
,,
2,12,"women 25 to 49 see you as a role model.
"
,,
2,12," Really?
"
,,
2,12," Absolutely.
"
,,
2,12," What about me?
"
,,
2,12," You?!
"
,,
2,12,"Look, the bottom line is
"
,,
2,12,"you folks are still under contract, OK?
"
,,
2,12,"But I've come up with a solution
"
,,
2,12,"I think will make everyone happy.
"
,,
2,12," Jason Gallagher.
"
,,
2,12," Present.
"
,,
2,12,"Meg Griffin.
"
,,
2,12," Oh, sorry I'm late, Mr...
"
,,
2,12," Here.
"
,,
2,12," Hello?
"
,,
2,12," Over here.
"
,,
2,12," Thank you for meeting us here. Cigarette?
"
,,
2,12," Peter.
"
,,
2,12," Sorry. We have to keep this brief.
"
,,
2,12," Why are we here?
"
,,
2,12,"No cameras. The TV executives don't want
"
,,
2,12,"viewers to be confused and think you're Meg.
"
,,
2,12," You're gonna let them recast me?
"
,,
2,12," Could've been worse.
"
,,
2,12,"They could've gone with plan B.
"
,,
2,12," Brian, put a mask on.
"
,,
2,12," I have an announcement.
"
,,
2,12,"""Meg Griffin's plane was shot down
"
,,
2,12,"over the Sea of Japan.""
"
,,
2,12,"""It spun in. There were no survivors.""
"
,,
2,12,"Who do I see about a Section Eight?
"
,,
2,12,"Fine! Do your stupid show without me.
"
,,
2,12,"I'll be at Cleveland's house. I don't
"
,,
2,12,"wanna be a part of this family any more.
"
,,
2,12," Meg!
"
,,
2,12," She'll be OK.
"
,,
2,12,"We gotta go. The cameramen think
"
,,
2,12,"we're taking Chris to soccer practice.
"
,,
2,12,"We're gonna be late!
"
,,
2,12,"Why won't you talk to me?!
"
,,
2,12,"Oh, Meg, honey, our home is your home
"
,,
2,12,"for as long as you like.
"
,,
2,12,"We could offer you the guest room,
"
,,
2,12,"provided that it doesn't bother you
"
,,
2,12,"that my Great Uncle Chet died in there.
"
,,
2,12,"Oh. I guess not.
"
,,
2,12,"Uh, when did he die?
"
,,
2,12,"We think sometime between
"
,,
2,12,"The Tonight Show and The Today Show. 
"
,,
2,12,"You know, some people think
"
,,
2,12,"that dandelions are weeds,
"
,,
2,12,"but, uh, you know, I always think...
"
,,
2,12,"who the hell decided tulips were so great?
"
,,
2,12,"Hey. Hey, I'm over here. Hey!
"
,,
2,12," Hi, Chris.
"
,,
2,12," You know my name?
"
,,
2,12,"Of course I do, silly. I'm your sister, Meg.
"
,,
2,12,"Oh.
"
,,
2,12,"Uh, I don't know if Mom and Dad told you,
"
,,
2,12,"but we usually have breakfast naked
"
,,
2,12,"and I'm allowed to videotape it.
"
,,
2,12,"Ooh, my skin's getting so slippery.
"
,,
2,12,"Hope I don't pop out of my top.
"
,,
2,12,"Ohh.
"
,,
2,12,"Hey, camera guy, check this out.
"
,,
2,12,"""Peter Griffin and Madame.""
"
,,
2,12,"Oh, Madame,
"
,,
2,12,"you're a lusty old girl, aren't you?
"
,,
2,12,"You're the one with
"
,,
2,12,"your hand up my backside.
"
,,
2,12,"Oh! She got me.
"
,,
2,12,"Hey! Hey, come back here!
"
,,
2,12,"She's gonna sing ""Rainbow Connection""!
"
,,
2,12,"Mr Quagmire, can I use your toothpaste?
"
,,
2,12,"Oh, my God! Excuse me.
"
,,
2,12,"No problem, Meg. You probably bought me
"
,,
2,12,"another three minutes. Giggedy-giggedy!

2,12," There was...
"

2,12," Hi.
"
,,
2,12," Hey!
"
,,
2,12," I had the worst day.
"
,,
2,12,"I didn't make cheerleader
"
,,
2,12,"because I'm so plain,
"
,,
2,12,"and I still don't have a date
"
,,
2,12,"for Friday night, as usual.
"
,,
2,12,"I'm going to write in my journal about how
"
,,
2,12,"I'll never grow big, full breasts like these.
"
,,
2,12,"It's not fair. If I don't get any airtime,
"
,,
2,12,"how am I ever gonna get my own spin-off
"
,,
2,12,"where I'm a retired baseball umpire
"
,,
2,12,"who opens a bar?
"
,,
2,12,"At the centre of the earth!
"
,,
2,12,"We don't get many of you
"
,,
2,12,"molten-rock men in here.
"
,,
2,12,"Well, at these prices I'm not surprised.
"
,,
2,12,"That's it, pal, you... are... outta here!
"
,,
2,12,"To hell with the cameras. How could we
"
,,
2,12,"ever let them replace our little girl?
"
,,
2,12,"I miss her, Peter.
"
,,
2,12,"Me too. She's like that dorky Baldwin brother
"
,,
2,12,"who isn't as good-Iooking or successful
"
,,
2,12,"and never answers my letters, but he's
"
,,
2,12,"still a Baldwin, dammit, and so is Meg.
"
,,
2,12,"Let's go get her back!
"
,,
2,12," What can I do for you?
"
,,
2,12," I'll tell you what you can do.
"
,,
2,12,"Fire that sexy, interesting version
"
,,
2,12,"of our daughter and make us a family again,
"
,,
2,12,"or we walk.
"
,,
2,12,"Fire her? She's the highest-testing
"
,,
2,12,"character on the show!
"
,,
2,12," Besides, you can't quit. You have a contract.
"
,,
2,12," Oh, yeah?
"
,,
2,12,"Well, here's what I think of your contract.
"
,,
2,12,"I think it's awful and I don't much care
"
,,
2,12,"for it at all, my good sir.
"
,,
2,12,"Lois, we're outta here.
"
,,
2,12,"Well, you put me in a very awkward position,
"
,,
2,12,"Peter, but I guess I have no choice.
"
,,
2,12,"Mom? Dad?
"
,,
2,12,"I'm home!
"
,,
2,12," Who are you?
"
,,
2,12," We're the Griffins.
"
,,
2,12,"No, you're not. You're Tom Arnold.
"
,,
2,12,"And you're Fran Drescher. And you're,
"
,,
2,12,"um, that fat guy from Boogie Nights. 
"
,,
2,12,"And you're... the Olsen twins?
"
,,
2,12,"Blast! Damn you all. Victory is mine.
"
,,
2,12,"Whose leg do you have to hump
"
,,
2,12,"to get a dry martini around here?
"
,,
2,12,"Oh, Peter, you promised me
"
,,
2,12,"you wouldn't drink at the stag party. 
"
,,
2,12,"Ugh! I do not sound like that.
"
,,
2,12,"This is terrible! We're the laughing stock
"

2,12,"of the town and we've lost our daughter.
"

2,12," Meg!
"

2,12," Oh, Mom!
"

2,12,"Look, I don't care if you guys embarrass me.
"

2,12,"I wanna come home.
"
,,
2,12,"Oh, sweetie, it's good to have you back.
"
,,
2,12,"Hey, honey, I'm sorry
"
,,
2,12,"we missed your ball game.
"
,,
2,12,"What?
"

,,
2,13,"cannot be measured in nipples and dimes.
"
,,
2,13,"I mean nickels and boobs.
"
,,
2,13,"Money. I'll be upstairs.
"
,,
2,13," Peter, why are you so...
"
,,
2,13," Get out! This is a part just for the men.
"
,,
2,13," I say, there's a plane.
"
,,
2,13," If there's a plane, there's probably a pilot.

,,
2,13,"And if there's a pilot, there must be a bar.
"
,,
2,13,"I can get a drink.

2,13," Eight miles that way?
"

2,13," Would you like to see her?
"
,,
2,13," ""See her""? I don't understand.
"
,,
2,13,"We loved Biscuit so much,
"
,,
2,13,"we wanted to keep her with us always.
"
,,
2,13,"So we had her stuffed!
"
,,
2,13,"because your mother's in stitches!</i>
"
,,
2,13,"I'll leave you to grieve.
"
,,
2,13,"Come on, Betty, why don't we get
"
,,
2,13,"these fellas some sandwiches?
"
,,
2,13,"Look at Jesus standing over there
"
,,
2,13,"all by himself.
"
,,
2,13,"You'd think those bulldogs would invite
"
,,
2,13,"him to their card game.
"
,,
2,13,"You deserve better than this, Mom.
"
,,
2,13,"This is actually a rather elegant solution
"
,,
2,13,"for my problem of what to do with Lois.
"
,,
2,13,"Shut up and help me.
"
,,
2,13,"I'm not leaving her here.
"
,,
2,13,"Oh, relax. Old girl doesn't have
"
,,
2,13,"too much to wag about these days, anyway.
"
,,
2,13,"Hey, Meg. Try to guess the word
"
,,
2,13,"I'm thinking of right now.
"
,,
2,13,"And it's not ""kitty"".
"
,,
2,13," ""Car"".
"
,,
2,13," No.
"
,,
2,13," I dunno. ""Apple"".
"
,,
2,13," No. Give up?
"
,,
2,13," Yeah.
"
,,
2,13," It was ""kitty""!
"
,,
2,13," Peter...
"
,,
2,13," Oh, my God! The new video! Life is sweet!
"
,,
2,13,"Oh, that's always good.
"
,,
2,13," Oh! That's good too.</i>
"
,,
2,13,"Oh, jeez, if she says ""Mrs Dash"",
"
,,
2,13,"I'm gonna lose it.
"
,,
2,13," Agh!</i>
"
,,
2,13,"and I'm very upset with you. </i>
"
,,
2,13,"Wow. Usually beautiful women don't turn
"
,,
2,13,"back into you until after I'm finished.
"
,,
2,13,"If you wanted to see a woman acting nasty... </i>
"
,,
2,13," Turn around. </i>
"
,,
2,13,"Lois! Ah, this is not what it looks like.
"
,,
2,13,"She means nothing to me.
"
,,
2,13," Peter, it's OK.
"
,,
2,13," Yeah?
"
,,
2,13,"I was trying to be sexy for ya.
"
,,
2,13,"Ahh! Come here, you!
"
,,
2,13,"I'm gonna get directions to the nearest park
"
,,
2,13,"so we can give my mother a proper burial.
"
,,
2,13,"Come on, darling. Stiff upper lip
"
,,
2,13,"I'm writing that one down.
"
,,
2,13," Say something.
"
,,
2,13," What?
"
,,
2,13," Just say something, please!
"
,,
2,13," Oh, for God's sake.
"
,,
2,13,"Um... Uh...
"
,,
2,13,"Yea, and God said to Abraham
"
,,
2,13,"you will kill your son Isaac.
"
,,
2,13,"And Abraham said ""I can't hear you.""
"
,,
2,13,"""You'll have to speak into the microphone.""
"
,,
2,13,"And God said ""Oh, I'm sorry. Is this better?""
"
,,
2,13,"""Jerry, pull the high end out.
"
,,
2,13,"I'm still getting some hiss back.""
"
,,
2,13," Say something about my mother!
"
,,
2,13," Oh, yes. I'm sorry.
"
,,
2,13,"I never knew Biscuit as a dog,
"
,,
2,13,"but I did know her as a table.
"
,,
2,13,"She was sturdy,
"
,,
2,13,"all four legs the same length...
"
,,
2,13,"Thanks. That's enough.
"
,,
2,13,"and so forth. Amen.</i>
"
,,
2,13,"Wow, look at all those stars.
"
,,
2,13,"I've read that starlight gives you cancer.
"
,,
2,13,"Then again, what doesn't these days?
"
,,
2,13,"Listen, there's something I've been meaning
"
,,
2,13,"to tell you. It's not easy for me to say.
"
,,
2,13,"Oh, God. You're not coming
"
,,
2,13,"out of the closet, are you?
"
,,
2,13,"I just wanted to thank you
"
,,
2,13,"for everything you did today.
"
,,
2,13," I know this whole trip has been a mess.
"
,,
2,13," Well, it hasn't been all bad.
"
,,
2,13,"I must admit there have been some moments
"
,,
2,13,"that were, dare I say, fun.
"
,,
2,13,"We're off on the road to Rhode Island
"
,,
2,13,"We're having the time of our lives
"
,,
2,13," Take it, dog!
"
,,
2,13," We're quite a pair of partners
"
,,
2,13,"Just like Thelma and Louise
"
,,
2,13,"'Cept you're not six feet tall
"
,,
2,13," And your breasts don't reach your knees.
"
,,
2,13," Give it time.
"
,,
2,13,"We're off on the road to Rhode Island
"
,,
2,13,"We're certainly going in style
"
,,
2,13,"I'm with an intellectual
"
,,
2,13," Who craps inside his pants
"
,,
2,13," How dare you?
"
,,
2,13,"At least I don't leave urine stains
"
,,
2,13,"on all the household plants
"
,,
2,13,"Oh, pee jokes.
"
,,
2,13,"We've travelled a bit and we've found
"
,,
2,13,"Like a masochist in Newport,
"
,,
2,13,"we're Rhode-Island bound
"
,,
2,13," Crazy travel conditions.
"
,,
2,13," First class and no class.
"
,,
2,13,"Careful with that joke-it's an antique.
"
,,
2,13,"We're off on the road to Rhode Island
"
,,
2,13,"We're not gonna stop till we're there
"
,,
2,13,"Maybe for a beer.
"
,,
2,13,"Whatever dangers we may face
"
,,
2,13," We'll never fear or cry
"
,,
2,13," That's right!
"
,,
2,13,"Until we're syndicated,
"
,,
2,13,"Fox will never let us die
"
,,
2,13," Please?
"
,,
2,13," We're off on the road to Rhode Island
"
,,
2,13,"The home of that old campus swing
"
,,
2,13,"We may pick up some college girls
"
,,
2,13,"And picnic on the grass
"
,,
2,13,"We'd tell you more
"
,,
2,13,"but we would have the censors on our ass
"
,,
2,13,"We certainly do get around
"
,,
2,13,"Like renegade Pilgrims
"
,,
2,13,"thrown out of Plymouth Colony.
"
,,
2,13,"We're Rhode Island-bound
"
,,
2,13,"Like two college freshmen who were rejected
"
,,
2,13,"by Harvard and forced to go to Brown.
"
,,
2,13,"We're Rhode Island-bound
"
,,
2,13,"Look who I found at the train station!
"
,,
2,13,"My baby! Mommy missed you so much.
"
,,
2,13,"God forbid you should have
"
,,
2,13,"put a little eyeliner on for my homecoming.
"
,,
2,13,"Did you have a nice trip with Brian?
"
,,
2,13,"Yes, smooth sailing through calm seas.
"
,,
2,13,"Hey, kid! Thanks for not ratting me out.
"
,,
2,13,"Is there anything I can do to pay you back?
"
,,
2,13,"Brady Bunch where Bobby saved Greg's life,</i>
"
,,
2,13," And Greg became his slave?
"
,,
2,13," Yep.
"
,,
2,13,"It's on this afternoon. You can tape it for me.
"
,,
2,13,"And put a nice label on it.
"
,,
2,13,"OK, Meg. I'm thinking of another word.
"
,,
2,13,"This time it's definitely not ""kitty"".
"
,,
2,13," Can you guess what it is?
"
,,
2,13," Is it ""kitty""?
"
,,
2,13,"Uh! Get out of my head!
"
,,
2,13,"Get out of my head!
"
,,
2,14,"It seems today that all you see
"
,,
2,14,"Is violence in movies and sex on TV
"
,,
2,14,"But where are those
"
,,
2,14,"good old-fashioned values
"
,,
2,14,"On which we used to rely?
"
,,
2,14,"Lucky there's a family guy
"
,,
2,14,"Lucky there's a man who positively
"
,,
2,14,"can do all the things that make us
"
,,
2,14,"Laugh and cry
"
,,
2,14,"He's a family guy
"
,,
2,14,"Cuando la jefe oye de esto somos muertos! 
"
,,
2,14,"Recuerda si yo cierra la puerta
"
,,
2,14,"de la garaje esta manana? 
"
,,
2,14,"Dude, the Bronze Age
"
,,
2,14,"was so much cooler than the Iron Age.
"
,,
2,14,"The Iron Age could kick
"
,,
2,14,"the Bronze Age's butt any day of the week.
"
,,
2,14," Could not!
"
,,
2,14," Could too!
"
,,
2,14,"Ew, gross, man!
"
,,
2,14," You OK?
"
,,
2,14," Whoa! Everything's so... significant.
"
,,
2,14," Dude, you gotta try this.
"
,,
2,14," Not even! It's got your germs on it.
"
,,
2,14,"Not this end.
"
,,
2,14,"Ahh! I can see the air!
"
,,
2,14,"And you know what else?
"
,,
2,14,"I finally get Aaron Sorkin's Sports Night. 
"
,,
2,14,"It's a comedy that's too good to be funny.
"
,,
2,14,"Dude, you're trippin'!
"
,,
2,14,"Double the freshness, life is more fun
"
,,
2,14,"When you're chewing
"
,,
2,14,"the great taste of Doublefresh gum
"
,,
2,14,"La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
"
,,
2,14,"With Doublefresh gum! 
"
,,
2,14,"Hey, we should go to the circus.
"
,,
2,14,"In local news, a new drug craze may have
"
,,
2,14,"Quahog students licked. It's called ""toad"". 
"
,,
2,14,"The Colombian spotted toad, to be precise. 
"
,,
2,14,"When licked, these toads trigger an intense
"
,,
2,14,"psychedelic euphoria that's... that's just great. 
"
,,
2,14,"This is awful. Now the drugs
"
,,
2,14,"are in the schools?
"
,,
2,14,"For you parents, toad-licking
"
,,
2,14,"is also known as lily-padding, 
"
,,
2,14,"Frenching the prince, and doing Kermit. 
"
,,
2,14,"Well, at least our kids know better.
"
,,
2,14,"What the...? Aargh!
"
,,
2,14,"Hello, little sea monkeys.
"
,,
2,14,"He's back. Don't look at him, honey.
"
,,
2,14,"Eat your potatoes.
"
,,
2,14," Steve, do something.
"
,,
2,14," Brenda, we've been over this.
"
,,
2,14,"Let's just pick up our plates
"
,,
2,14,"and go eat in the hollow castle.
"
,,
2,14," Young man, where did you get this toad?
"
,,
2,14," It's not mine.
"
,,
2,14,"Believe me, you don't wanna mess with
"
,,
2,14,"drugs. I tried 'em once-big mistake.
"
,,
2,14,"Things got way too real.
"
,,
2,14,"Holy crap, I am freakin' out!
"
,,
2,14,"Peter, may I? You're walking down a hallway.
"
,,
2,14,"You take a left. You keep walking.
"
,,
2,14," Take a right. Then a left. Brick wall!
"
,,
2,14," Yargh!
"
,,
2,14," Yeah, he's tweaked.
"
,,
2,14," Am not! Hey, maybe it's Meg's toad.
"
,,
2,14,"Oh, now, don't you try to palm this off
"
,,
2,14,"on your sister. She's a good girl.
"
,,
2,14,"Oh, yeah? What about the time
"
,,
2,14,"she strangled our other sister?
"
,,
2,14,"Now, Chris, we told you
"
,,
2,14,"that was just a very bad dream.
"
,,
2,14," But I remember it so...
"
,,
2,14," It was a dream!
"
,,
2,14," Mom, can you sign this for my field trip?
"
,,
2,14," Sure, sweetheart.
"
,,
2,14,"Meg, you have a wart!
"
,,
2,14,"How could you bring a toad into this house?
"
,,
2,14,"It's not mine. I was just holding it for a friend.
"
,,
2,14,"See... it was lunchtime.
"
,,
2,14,"OK, Connie, you're up.
"
,,
2,14,"Connie Demico does toad?
"
,,
2,14,"I guess Miss Wears-A-Hat-All-The-Time
"
,,
2,14,"is gonna nark on us, aren't you?
"
,,
2,14," Mr Berler's coming!
"
,,
2,14," Oh, man, we are so busted!
"
,,
2,14,"Put it in here. He won't check me.
"
,,
2,14,"What's going on back here? Oh, hello, Megan.
"
,,
2,14,"Wait, you're not part of the popular clique.
"
,,
2,14,"Run along and play alone somewhere. Shame
"
,,
2,14,"on you all, getting her hopes up like that.
"
,,
2,14,"I thought if I held Connie's toad,
"
,,
2,14,"she'd make one of the cool guys
"
,,
2,14,"ask me to the Snow Ball.
"
,,
2,14,"You're holding drugs so someone
"
,,
2,14,"will invite you to a dance?
"
,,
2,14,"Meg, haven't we taught you better than that?
"
,,
2,14,"Hold on, Lois. People do a lot of
"
,,
2,14,"crazy things just to be accepted.
"
,,
2,14,"I don't know about this.
"
,,
2,14,"We all did it. If you want to be
"
,,
2,14,"a Supreme Court justice,
"
,,
2,14,"you gotta pick up that cherry
"
,,
2,14,"with your butt cheeks and drop it in that beer.
"
,,
2,14," Come on! Come on!
"
,,
2,14," Go, Suitor! Get busy!
"
,,
2,14," Go, Suitor! Go, Suitor!
"
,,
2,14," Cherry! Cherry! Cherry!
"
,,
2,14,"Oh, my God! I can't believe he did that!
"
,,
2,14," Go, Suitor! Go, Suitor!
"
,,
2,14," Get busy! Get busy!
"
,,
2,14,"Ohhh!
"
,,
2,14,"I can't believe he did that!
"
,,
2,14,"I can't believe he did that! This guy is so in!
"
,,
2,14,"Oh, sweetheart, I'm sure all the boys
"
,,
2,14,"wanna ask you to the dance.
"
,,
2,14,"They're probably just shy or scared.
"
,,
2,14,"Yeah, I was terrified of askin'
"
,,
2,14,"Phoebe Diamond to the prom.
"
,,
2,14,"I finally got up the guts,
"
,,
2,14,"but I had this damn nervous twitch.
"
,,
2,14," Um, Ph-Ph-Phoebe?
"
,,
2,14," Yeah?
"
,,
2,14,"Uh, I was wonderin' if... if... if you'd, uh,
"
,,
2,14,"d-do me the honour of, uh...
"
,,
2,14,"I had such a crush on her.
"
,,
2,14,"Until I met you, Lois.
"
,,
2,14,"You're my silver medal.
"
,,
2,14,"Mr Toad, how many licks of you does it take
"
,,
2,14,"to get to the centre
"
,,
2,14,"of a Rhode Island state prison? 
"
,,
2,14,"Just one.
"
,,
2,14,"How could this happen? I thought
"
,,
2,14,"we lived in such a nice small town.
"
,,
2,14,"There's no such thing. Things
"
,,
2,14,"are different than when we were kids.
"
,,
2,14," Well, it just makes me sad.
"
,,
2,14," It makes me sad too, but, uh, you know.
"
,,
2,14,"I mean, if Meg's at risk, then so is Chris, and
"
,,
2,14,"Stewie'll be in preschool before we know it.
"
,,
2,14,"Well, we just have to trust
"
,,
2,14,"our kids to stay off drugs.
"
,,
2,14,"I do trust our kids.
"
,,
2,14,"It's the other kids I don't trust.
"
,,
2,14,"Yeah. Yeah, well, you know, I guess it's up to
"
,,
2,14,"us as parents to be a part of the solution.
"
,,
2,14," I'll go talk to the principal tomorrow.
"
,,
2,14," Thanks, honey.
"
,,
2,14," The safety word is banana.
"
,,
2,14," I love you.
"
,,
2,14,"And that's my plan, Principal Shepherd.
"
,,
2,14,"So, are you with me?
"
,,
2,14,"But... you didn't tell me anything. You just
"
,,
2,14,"sat down and said ""And that's my plan.""
"
,,
2,14,"Oh. Oh, right. OK, here's my idea.
"
,,
2,14," And that's my plan, Principal Shepherd.
"
,,
2,14," Well, Mr Griffin, I don't like it.
"
,,
2,14,"I love it! You have the faculty's full support.
"
,,
2,14,"But how will you pull it off?
"
,,
2,14,"You let me worry about that, kitten.
"
,,
2,14,"Great.
"
,,
2,14,"Hey, Meg. What's got four arms,
"
,,
2,14,"four legs and one set of lips?
"
,,
2,14,"You and me at the Winter Snow Ball.
"
,,
2,14,"Heh-heh!
"
,,
2,14,"Look, Neil, I don't... Oh, my God!
"
,,
2,14,"Dad? Dad?!
"
,,
2,14,"I'm not responding because
"
,,
2,14,"I'm not this ""Dad"" person.
"
,,
2,14,"I'm the new kid in town, Lando Griffin.
"
,,
2,14,"Are you crazy? What are you doing here?
"
,,
2,14,"I've gone undercover
"
,,
2,14,"to get rid of the toad problem,
"
,,
2,14,"so your school can be safe
"
,,
2,14,"and innocent like the good old days.
"
,,
2,14,"Negative B plus or minus
"
,,
2,14,"radical B squared minus 4AC over 2A.
"
,,
2,14,"That's correct. A girl answered a math
"
,,
2,14,"problem. You know what that means.
"
,,
2,14,"A witch!
"
,,
2,14," Witch! She's a witch!
"
,,
2,14," Witch!
"
,,
2,14,"Witch!
"
,,
2,14,"God, please tell me I have a brain tumour and
"
,,
2,14,"this is all just a side effect from the chemo.
"
,,
2,14," Hey, what are you doin' in my locker?
"
,,
2,14," Your locker?
"
,,
2,14,"Say, Phil, what do you say
"
,,
2,14,"to happy hour after work?
"
,,
2,14,"I'd say Cheryl's gonna have another
"
,,
2,14,"black eye to explain to the neighbours.
"
,,
2,14," Come on, I'm buyin'.
"
,,
2,14," Oh, yeah.
"
,,
2,14," Hey, man, cool specs.
"
,,
2,14," Thanks, G.
"
,,
2,14,"I'm the new kid in town, Lando Griffin.
"
,,
2,14,"No relation. So, tell me, homeboy, how 'bout
"
,,
2,14,"the baggy clothes we kids are wearin'?
"
,,
2,14,"Aren't they phat and stupid
"
,,
2,14,"and poppin' fresh?
"
,,
2,14,"Hey, does anybody have any drugs?
"
,,
2,14,"I'm lookin' to score some drugs.
"
,,
2,14," Dad, get away from me. Connie is looking.
"
,,
2,14," So that's toad girl, huh?
"
,,
2,14,"Yeah. And that's Connie.
"
,,
2,14,"I see. Well, I'm gonna have
"
,,
2,14,"a little talk with that Connie.
"
,,
2,14,"Huh! Good luck.
"
,,
2,14,"She only talks to the cool kids.
"
,,
2,14," Oh, yeah? Watch this.
"
,,
2,14," No!
"
,,
2,14,"Heeey!
"
,,
2,14,"Agh! Agh! Ow! Oh, God! Agh! Ow! Ow!
"
,,
2,14," Cool! He's bleeding!
"
,,
2,14," Just like in the movies!
"
,,
2,14,"Hm.
"
,,
2,14,"Holy crap, it's The Breakfast Club. 
"
,,
2,14,"You know what I got for Christmas?
"
,,
2,14,"It was a banner year at the Tiger house.
"
,,
2,14,"I got a carton of cigarettes. Old man
"
,,
2,14,"grabbed me, said ""Hey, smoke up, Tony.""
"
,,
2,14,"""They're grrreat!"" Bastard.
"
,,
2,14,"Hey, Lando.
"
,,
2,14,"Everyone's talking about how you
"
,,
2,14,"trashed the jukebox. Classic cool.
"
,,
2,14," We're gonna do some toad. You in?
"
,,
2,14," You're gonna do toad?!
"
,,
2,14," What's the big deal?
"
,,
2,14," Lemme tell you about it, stud.
"
,,
2,14,"You'll get chills
"
,,
2,14,"All through your body
"
,,
2,14,"And you'll lose all control
"
,,
2,14,"Of your bladder
"
,,
2,14,"And your sphincter
"
,,
2,14,"That's your butt hole!
"
,,
2,14,"Cos if you use toad
"
,,
2,14,"Then I'm tellin' you
"
,,
2,14,"You can kiss your life goodbye
"
,,
2,14,"Yeah, when you use toad
"
,,
2,14,"It'll mess you up
"
,,
2,14,"It'll make your mama cry
"
,,
2,14,"That's no lie
"
,,
2,14,"You'll choke on your tongue and die
"
,,
2,14,"Gotta give it up
"
,,
2,14,"Give up the toad now
"
,,
2,14,"It's no joke
"
,,
2,14,"Buddy, give it up
"
,,
2,14,"Gotta give up the toad now
"
,,
2,14,"Or you'll croak
"
,,
2,14,"Buddy, give it up
"
,,
2,14,"You gotta give up the toad now
"
,,
2,14,"And don't smoke
"
,,
2,14,"Or you'll see
"
,,
2,14,"It hurts to pee
"
,,
2,14,"There'll be blood
"
,,
2,14,"Gushin' from ya
"
,,
2,14,"Every time that you cough
"
,,
2,14,"And forget gettin' lucky
"
,,
2,14,"It falls off
"
,,
2,14,"Yeah, you'd better wise up
"
,,
2,14,"Cos I'm tellin' you
"
,,
2,14,"Toad is what Lando forbids
"
,,
2,14,"Gotta give it all up
"
,,
2,14,"Or you're gonna see
"
,,
2,14,"Your whole life will hit the skids
"
,,
2,14,"And your kids will be born without eyelids
"
,,
2,14,"Gotta give it up
"
,,
2,14,"Give up the toad now
"
,,
2,14,"Thanks to you, Lando
"
,,
2,14,"Give it up
"
,,
2,14,"Give up the toad now
"
,,
2,14,"Thanks to you, Lando
"
,,
2,14,"Give it up
"
,,
2,14,"Gotta give up the toad now
"
,,
2,14,"Ooh, ooh, ooh
"
,,
2,14,"I'm no fool
"
,,
2,14,"Lando's cool
"
,,
2,14,"Yeah!
"
,,
2,14," You're the coolest, Lando.
"
,,
2,14," Yeah.
"
,,
2,14,"We never broke into song and dance
"
,,
2,14,"before you arrived.
"
,,
2,14,"I'll never touch another toad. None of us will.
"
,,
2,14," Yeah.
"
,,
2,14," No way, man.
"
,,
2,14," I know I won't.
"
,,
2,14," You never did it in the first place.
"
,,
2,14," God! You're such a wannabe loser.
"
,,
2,14," Oh, yeah? If I'm such a loser,
"
,,
2,14,"how come I'm going to
"
,,
2,14,"the Snow Ball with Lando?
"
,,
2,14,"Meg, you got a date?!
"
,,
2,14,"Oh, wait till I tell your mother!
"
,,
2,14,"Who I'm looking forward to meeting.
"
,,
2,14,"And I hope is making Steak Ums tonight.
"
,,
2,14," Hey, Meg, wanna ditch and go to the mall?
"
,,
2,14," Sure! See ya, Lando.
"
,,
2,14,"This is great. Not only did I live long
"
,,
2,14,"enough to see Meg go to her first dance,
"
,,
2,14,"but I'm takin' her too. Thanks, Geritol.
"
,,
2,14,"And they swore they'd never do toad again.
"
,,
2,14,"Dad never came to sing at my school.
"
,,
2,14,"I don't want dessert!
"
,,
2,14,"I tell you, Lois, high school's
"
,,
2,14,"a lot more fun this time around.
"
,,
2,14,"And it's a lot safer now that all the kids
"
,,
2,14,"have guns. And today in study hall,
"
,,
2,14,"I farted real loud on purpose
"
,,
2,14,"to make the guys laugh,
"
,,
2,14,"and I swear to God it was so heinous Susie
"
,,
2,14,"Johnson ralphed up her Salisbury steak.
"
,,
2,14,"I'm sorry, is this really
"
,,
2,14,"proper dinner conversation?
"
,,
2,14,"I'm glad you taught those kids
"
,,
2,14,"they don't have to do drugs to be popular.
"
,,
2,14,"He sure did! Who needs drugs when you go
"
,,
2,14,"to the dance with the coolest guy in school?
"
,,
2,14,"Going with Dad is gonna skyrocket
"
,,
2,14,"me up the popularity food chain.
"
,,
2,14,"It's true. Soon members of the math club will
"
,,
2,14,"be attaching themselves to your underbelly.
"
,,
2,14,"Wait a minute. Peter, you can't
"
,,
2,14,"take Meg to a school dance.
"
,,
2,14,"How long do you think
"
,,
2,14,"you can keep up this charade?
"
,,
2,14,"Just till Friday! Please, Mom?
"
,,
2,14,"Well, if this is what you want.
"
,,
2,14,"Oh, it's probably Connie calling for me.
"
,,
2,14,"Hello?
"
,,
2,14,"Oh. Yeah, hold on. It's for Lando.
"
,,
2,14,"Aloha!
"
,,
2,14,"No way!
"
,,
2,14,"Uh... uh, hold on. I'm gonna
"
,,
2,14,"take this in the other room.
"
,,
2,14,"I got it!
"
,,
2,14,"Hang up!
"
,,
2,14,"Mother, this could almost have
"
,,
2,14,"passed for a palatable banana pudding,
"
,,
2,14,"but without Nilla wafers, it's just another one
"
,,
2,14,"of your wretched culinary abortions!
"
,,
2,14,"Clean it up!
"
,,
2,14,"I don't think so.
"
,,
2,14,"Neil, I'm a little out of your league.
"
,,
2,14,"Besides, I'm going with Lando.
"
,,
2,14,"Really? My underground
"
,,
2,14,"sources have informed me
"
,,
2,14,"that Lando is taking Connie Demico.
"
,,
2,14,"What?!
"
,,
2,14,"Hey, I thought you were
"
,,
2,14,"taking me to the dance!
"
,,
2,14,"Uh...
"
,,
2,14,"Something suddenly came up.
"
,,
2,14," How could you do this to Meg?
"
,,
2,14," Not now, I gotta write about Oliver Twist. 
"
,,
2,14,"Oliver Twit,  if you ask me. I would have done
"
,,
2,14,"things rather differently, I can tell you that.
"
,,
2,14,"Please, sir, I want some more.
"
,,
2,14," What?
"
,,
2,14," Please, sir, I want some more.
"
,,
2,14,"More?!
"
,,
2,14,"All right. Stop it. Stop it right there.
"
,,
2,14,"Now, go on, fill up the bowl.
"
,,
2,14,"Go on! That's it.
"
,,
2,14,"Now put on this dress.
"
,,
2,14,"Put it on!
"
,,
2,14,"Now dance.
"
,,
2,14,"Hey. Hey, Brian, the guy who wrote this,
"
,,
2,14,"his name? Charles Dickens.
"
,,
2,14," Oh, yeah.
"
,,
2,14," I want an explanation, mister.
"
,,
2,14,"Hey, Connie pulled a power move.
"
,,
2,14,"When the most popular girl in school
"
,,
2,14,"asks you to the dance, you don't say no,
"
,,
2,14,"you say ""Haba-haba-haba... OK.""
"
,,
2,14,"I can't understand why you'd dump
"
,,
2,14,"your daughter for Connie Demico.
"
,,
2,14,"It's simple transference.
"
,,
2,14,"To Peter, Connie Demico is Phoebe Diamond,
"
,,
2,14,"the most popular girl in his school.
"
,,
2,14,"Oh, my God. I think he's right.
"
,,
2,14,"When I try to speed things up in bed, I'm not
"
,,
2,14,"thinkin' of Connie, I'm thinkin' of Phoebe.
"
,,
2,14,"This whole thing is ridiculous.
"
,,
2,14,"I forbid you from goin' to that dance.
"
,,
2,14,"You can't tell me what to do.
"
,,
2,14,"You're not my real mom!
"
,,
2,14," End of discussion!
"
,,
2,14," Thank you for ruining my life!
"
,,
2,14,"You don't remember
"
,,
2,14,"what it's like to be my age!
"
,,
2,14,"I'm two years younger than you!
"
,,
2,14,"I hate you!
"
,,
2,14,"Greg Allman, how did you handle it
"
,,
2,14,"when life got you down?
"
,,
2,14,"Me? I did a lot of drugs,
"
,,
2,14,"married some broad named Cher...
"
,,
2,14,"and I wouldn't recommend either one of 'em.
"
,,
2,14,"I gotta fight for my right to party.
"
,,
2,14,"Whoa-ah! Argh!
"
,,
2,14," Thanks, Spider-Man.
"
,,
2,14," Everybody gets one.
"
,,
2,14," Sweetie?
"
,,
2,14," You married a total jerk!
"
,,
2,14,"Honey, he didn't mean to hurt you. And,
"
,,
2,14,"you know, you could still go to the dance.
"
,,
2,14,"Alone? Why don't I just tattoo
"
,,
2,14,"a big L on my forehead while I'm at it?
"
,,
2,14,"Now, Meg, you know my feelings on tattoos.
"
,,
2,14,"If you stay home, you're just proving to
"
,,
2,14,"the other kids that you don't belong there.
"
,,
2,14," Yeah.
"
,,
2,14," And you might have a really good time.
"
,,
2,14,"I'll tell you one thing.
"
,,
2,14,"I still regret not goin' to my junior dance.
"
,,
2,14,"But, Daddy, if you don't do
"
,,
2,14,"what they say, they'll kill me!
"
,,
2,14,"Sorry, pumpkin, we don't negotiate
"
,,
2,14,"with kidnappers-family policy.
"
,,
2,14,"Daddy, no. Please! Please!
"
,,
2,14,"She'll be all right.
"
,,
2,14,"Come on, what do you say?
"
,,
2,14,"Well... I do have that
"
,,
2,14,"really slutty dress you hate.
"
,,
2,14,"So, uh, Lando, how old
"
,,
2,14,"did you say you were again?
"
,,
2,14,"And a half.
"
,,
2,14,"Sweet statutory, you look beautiful!
"
,,
2,14,"Don't worry, I'll take good care of your kid.
"
,,
2,14,"I got a daughter of my own, you know.
"
,,
2,14,"Please leave the light off.
"
,,
2,14,"I don't want to be seen.
"
,,
2,14,"I imagine you wouldn't,
"
,,
2,14,"the way you've been acting.
"
,,
2,14," I thought you might say something like that. 
"
,,
2,14," Well, you do have it coming.
"
,,
2,14,"I convinced Meg to go to the dance,
"
,,
2,14,"so I'm gonna go drop her off.
"
,,
2,14,"Please don't yell. I've learned my lesson. 
"
,,
2,14," I wasn't yelling. I was just sayin' that...
"
,,
2,14," Oh, you would bring that up. 
"
,,
2,14," Can't you leave the past where it belongs? 
"
,,
2,14," What's wrong with you?
"
,,
2,14,"Because I've already explained that to you. 
"
,,
2,14,"It was a scavenger hunt. 
"
,,
2,14,"What the hell is goin' on here?
"
,,
2,14,"Lois, if you still haven't discovered I'm gone, 
"
,,
2,14,"please flip the tape over to side B. 
"
,,
2,14,"Nice moves, Lando.
"
,,
2,14,"OK, everyone. The votes are in.
"
,,
2,14,"This year's king and queen are...
"
,,
2,14,"Lando Griffin and Connie Demico!
"
,,
2,14,"Oh, my goodness! Oh!
"
,,
2,14,"Hold it. I can't be your king.
"
,,
2,14,"I have a confession. I've been living a lie!
"
,,
2,14,"I shouldn't be here... with Connie.
"
,,
2,14," My first choice was Meg Griffin.
"
,,
2,14," What?
"
,,
2,14,"Meg Griffin! She's right
"
,,
2,14,"over there in the back.
"
,,
2,14,"Ri... No, no, no, to the left. No, no,
"
,,
2,14,"you had her. No, no, go back, go back.
"
,,
2,14,"You got a monkey workin' the spotlight.
"
,,
2,14,"No, to the right, genius. Th-there. Stop. Stop.
"
,,
2,14,"That's my dream girl. But I'm not
"
,,
2,14,"good enough for her and she dumped me.
"
,,
2,14,"So now, heartbroken, I will ride recklessly
"
,,
2,14,"into the night and up Dead Man's Curve.
"
,,
2,14,"Goodbye, Meg. I love you.
"
,,
2,14," Meg, wanna dance?
"
,,
2,14," I was here first. Meg, dance with me?
"
,,
2,14," Neil, would you...?
"
,,
2,14," I would be honoured.
"
,,
2,14,"Thanks!
"
,,
2,14,"And Lando Griffin, 
"
,,
2,14,"a popular student at a local high school, 
"
,,
2,14,"was killed last night when his motorcycle
"
,,
2,14,"careened off Dead Man's Curve. 
"
,,
2,14,"Police were baffled when no body was found, 
"
,,
2,14,"but they decided not to ask questions
"
,,
2,14,"and just let everyone get on with their lives. 
"
,,
2,14," I'm so proud of you.
"
,,
2,14," Oh, Daddy, thank you so much!
"
,,
2,14," I was the most popular girl at the dance.
"
,,
2,14," Oh, anything for you, sweetheart.
"
,,
2,14,"Well, I'm off to popularity. Ciao!
"
,,
2,14,"God, I hate that manly walk of hers.
"
,,
2,15,"It seems today that all you see
"
,,
2,15,"Is violence in movies and sex on TV
"
,,
2,15,"But where are those
"
,,
2,15,"good old-fashioned values
"
,,
2,15,"On which we used to rely?
"
,,
2,15,"Lucky there's a family guy
"
,,
2,15,"Lucky there's a man who positively
"
,,
2,15,"can do all the things that make us
"
,,
2,15,"Laugh and cry
"
,,
2,15,"He's a family guy
"
,,
2,15,"Billiam, are you there?
"
,,
2,15,"Stewie!
"
,,
2,15," Wh-what the devil are you doing here?
"
,,
2,15," Billiam sent me.
"
,,
2,15,"He wanted me to tell you I killed him.
"
,,
2,15,"Now give me the other half of the amulet.
"
,,
2,15,"I don't think you'll be making it to Marrakech.
"
,,
2,15,"Don't! Please!
"
,,
2,15,"No!
"
,,
2,15,"Jeffrey, take the 9pm to Hounslow
"
,,
2,15,"out of your mouth.
"
,,
2,15,"Oh, look at that.
"
,,
2,15,"Our little boys are becomin' fast friends.
"
,,
2,15,"I say, Jeffrey, be a sport, will you, and go get
"
,,
2,15,"the sifter so we can build our sand village.
"
,,
2,15,"That's right. A little further.
"
,,
2,15,"Everyone, meet Jeffrey, the newest member
"
,,
2,15,"of the club of forgotten children.
"
,,
2,15,"Steve walks warily down the street
"
,,
2,15,"with his brim pulled way down low
"
,,
2,15," What the hell are you doing?
"
,,
2,15," Takin' down the Christmas decorations.
"
,,
2,15,"Peter, I'm concerned about Stewie. He
"
,,
2,15,"doesn't seem to play well with other children.
"
,,
2,15,"Oh, he's fine. You know, I was quite
"
,,
2,15,"a troublemaker myself when I was a kid.
"
,,
2,15,"Your parents'll be home any minute.
"
,,
2,15,"Are you sure you don't want me to clean up?
"
,,
2,15,"No, no, no. Go. Go. It'll be funny.
"
,,
2,15,"Stewie needs to learn
"
,,
2,15,"to socialise with other children.
"
,,
2,15," Maybe we should put him in daycare.
"
,,
2,15," Lois, his answers are out on the open road.
"
,,
2,15,"I say we give him a hobo pack on a stick,
"
,,
2,15,"a can of beans and a pocketful of dreams.
"
,,
2,15,"Peter, do you even know which one
"
,,
2,15,"of our children I'm talking about?
"
,,
2,15,"Gordon?
"
,,
2,15,"I got 'em! Ha-ha-ha! It's just like hunting.
"
,,
2,15,"Chris, stop it.
"
,,
2,15,"What will the neighbours think?
"
,,
2,15,"Abner! Abner! The Griffin boy
"
,,
2,15,"just killed a plastic reindeer!
"
,,
2,15,"Gladys, it took me two hours to work up
"
,,
2,15,"the courage to rent this porno.
"
,,
2,15,"Now, are you gonna watch it with me or not?
"
,,
2,15,"OK, Mommy's leaving you here for a while.
"
,,
2,15,"Try to play nice with the other children.
"
,,
2,15,"What do you mean, you're leaving me here?
"
,,
2,15,"What is this place?
"
,,
2,15," Come on, let go.
"
,,
2,15," Why, you soulless witch!
"
,,
2,15,"This is a biogenetic
"
,,
2,15,"experimentation facility, isn't it? Admit it!
"
,,
2,15,"Oh, sweetheart, don't be upset.
"
,,
2,15,"You're gonna have fun here.
"
,,
2,15,"Look, if this is about the whole
"
,,
2,15,"me-killing-you thing, it was a bit!
"
,,
2,15,"I was doing shtick, I tell you!
"
,,
2,15,"Humina-humina-humina!
"
,,
2,15,"Oh! I'm so bored. Without Stewie around,
"
,,
2,15,"I have nothin' to do.
"
,,
2,15," Well... we could get hammered.
"
,,
2,15," Oh, it's too early for me, but you go ahead.
"
,,
2,15,"What happened to me?
"
,,
2,15,"You know, before I was married,
"
,,
2,15,"I led a very exciting life.
"
,,
2,15,"Oh, my God! The actress who was
"
,,
2,15,"the girl in Escape from Witch Mountain! 
"
,,
2,15,"Maybe a part-time job
"
,,
2,15,"would liven up your days.
"
,,
2,15,"Brian! That's a terrific idea!
"
,,
2,15,"A job? Lois, the '70s are over. Forget it.
"
,,
2,15,"Mom, you can't get a job.
"
,,
2,15,"The last time you left Dad home alone,
"
,,
2,15,"he turned the house into a giant puppet.
"
,,
2,15,"Hey. Hey! Stay outta here. Hey!
"
,,
2,15,"Nobody better come in here. 
"
,,
2,15,"I'm the Griffins' house. 
"
,,
2,15,"Bring me a tool shed, for I am hungry. 
"
,,
2,15,"Uh... If you get a job,
"
,,
2,15,"who's gonna feed me and protect me
"
,,
2,15,"from the evil monkey in my closet?
"
,,
2,15,"Now, Chris, you know there's no such thing.
"
,,
2,15,"No!
"
,,
2,15," Oh, now you've gone and upset the boy.
"
,,
2,15," Peter, this is a new chapter in my life.
"
,,
2,15,"The kids are growin', the nest is empty,
"
,,
2,15,"and I need some excitement.
"
,,
2,15,"What are you talkin' about?
"
,,
2,15,"Your life is plenty exciting. For example...
"
,,
2,15,"There you go! Good night.
"
,,
2,15,"Duck.
"
,,
2,15,"Duck. Duck.
"
,,
2,15,"I say, does anyone know how
"
,,
2,15,"The Practice ended last night? I dozed off.
"
,,
2,15,"Goose!
"
,,
2,15,"Oh, dear. It seems you're still it.
"
,,
2,15,"Stewie, what have you done?
"
,,
2,15,"That's not the way we play.
"
,,
2,15,"You sit here, Brad. Stewie's it.
"
,,
2,15,"Ooh! Aren't you the one in charge!
"
,,
2,15,"Oh, let's see, now. Duck. Duck.
"
,,
2,15,"Duck.
"
,,
2,15,"Goose!
"
,,
2,15,"Oh, come on, now. I barely touched you.
"
,,
2,15,"Really. Stop it. Stop your boohooing.
"
,,
2,15,"Stop it, I say. Stop it!
"
,,
2,15,"You see? You see? This is exactly
"
,,
2,15,"why people don't respect the WNBA.
"
,,
2,15,"Hey, guys, guys, get this.
"
,,
2,15,"So Lois wants a part-time job, right?
"
,,
2,15,"So I'm, like, I got a job
"
,,
2,15,"for you, baby... right here!
"
,,
2,15,"The zipper's been broken for over a month.
"
,,
2,15,"I gotta use a damn safety pin.
"
,,
2,15,"If Lois is lookin' for a thrill,
"
,,
2,15,"I could get her a job with the airline.
"
,,
2,15,"Stewardesses get to travel to exotic places,
"
,,
2,15,"and their husbands fly anywhere for free.
"
,,
2,15,"Fly for free?
"
,,
2,15,"Sorry, Tink. Looks like
"
,,
2,15,"I don't need you any more.
"
,,
2,15,"So, what? You're just gonna dump me?
"
,,
2,15,"Just like that?
"
,,
2,15,"You knew what this was.
"
,,
2,15,"A flight attendant? Wow, that does sound
"
,,
2,15,"exciting. What made you change your mind?
"
,,
2,15," Just my desire to see you happy.
"
,,
2,15," Oh!
"
,,
2,15,"And to exploit your hard labour for free
"
,,
2,15,"travel.
"
,,
2,15," What?
"
,,
2,15," Shh!
"
,,
2,15,"I didn't say anything.
"
,,
2,15,"Go to sleep, crazy lady.
"
,,
2,15,"Oh, Rupert, I can't sleep. I don't suppose
"
,,
2,15,"you have any Valium on you?
"
,,
2,15,"No, of course not. You're living the clean life
"
,,
2,15,"now. It's that pathetic little insect in daycare.
"
,,
2,15,"Janet.
"
,,
2,15,"Whining, insignificant wisp of fluff, she is.
"
,,
2,15,"Still, I find it odd that she's even on my mind
"
,,
2,15,"at all. What the deuce has come over me?
"
,,
2,15,"Well, well, well.
"
,,
2,15," Looks like someone's in love.
"
,,
2,15," Ha! That's so funny I forgot to laugh.
"
,,
2,15," Excluding that first ""Ha"".
"
,,
2,15," You're a sucker for a woman with blue eyes.
"
,,
2,15," Aha! Her eyes are green!
"
,,
2,15," Thank you for proving my point.
"
,,
2,15,"Damn!
"
,,
2,15,"Look at her, Leonard, sitting there
"
,,
2,15,"with her curly ebony locks
"
,,
2,15,"and those pouty come-hither lips.
"
,,
2,15,"My God, she's unappealing.
"
,,
2,15," Go!
"
,,
2,15," Who said that? Mm?
"
,,
2,15,"Who's got the big diapers? Huh?
"
,,
2,15,"She's gone. Good. Well, I'm off.
"
,,
2,15,"Hi, Stewie.
"
,,
2,15,"H... Um... Er... Y-y...
"
,,
2,15,"Leonard, you pudgy-faced apple-john,
"
,,
2,15,"I will not be made a fool of!
"
,,
2,15,"Here's your pillow, sir.
"
,,
2,15,"And your Sports Illustrated. 
"
,,
2,15," He's putting his arm on my armrest.
"
,,
2,15," It's my armrest.
"
,,
2,15,"Is not, stupid head! And he keeps
"
,,
2,15,"tryin' to take my apple juice.
"
,,
2,15," I'll bring you your own juice.
"
,,
2,15," Agh!
"
,,
2,15,"Hey, he keeps licking his finger
"
,,
2,15,"and touching me!
"
,,
2,15,"Hey, fellas, I hope you're hungry. Aagh!
"
,,
2,15,"Oh, my God! Oh, no, my Go...
"
,,
2,15,"Somebody help. Help. Help!
"
,,
2,15,"That was great.
"
,,
2,15,"Look at her, she's still shakin'.
"
,,
2,15,"Bastards.
"
,,
2,15,"That was beautiful.
"
,,
2,15,"Hey, throw me a beer, would ya?
"
,,
2,15,"Stewardess, the plane just made
"
,,
2,15,"my beer spill. I want a free one.
"
,,
2,15,"Sir, all your beers have been free.
"
,,
2,15,"All nine of them.
"
,,
2,15,"And don't you forget it, Frenchie.
"
,,
2,15,"Now bring me another one -
"
,,
2,15,"the movie's startin'.
"
,,
2,15,"Oh, come on.
"
,,
2,15,"Show me Morgan Fairchild in
"
,,
2,15,"deep something. Huh? Huh? Huh?
"
,,
2,15,"Ah, you don't care.
"
,,
2,15,"Hey, Frenchie, is my fort ready?
"
,,
2,15,"Yes, Mr Griffin, even though
"
,,
2,15,"no one else has any pillows now.
"
,,
2,15,"All right!
"
,,
2,15,"I tell you, Leonard,
"
,,
2,15,"women are wicked creatures.
"
,,
2,15,"They precipitated the downfall
"
,,
2,15,"of history's most powerful men!
"
,,
2,15,"So let it be known I want absolutely nothing
"
,,
2,15,"to do with the wretched enterprise of love!
"
,,
2,15,"Janet's coming.
"
,,
2,15,"Agh!
"
,,
2,15,"Argh!
"
,,
2,15,"Aa... Er, yes. Yes.
"
,,
2,15,"Hi. Cookie?
"
,,
2,15,"No, no, actually, it's Stewie, but, well,
"
,,
2,15,"you can call me Cookie if you like.
"
,,
2,15,"Yes. I... Yes, I've also been known to answer
"
,,
2,15,"to Artemis, Agent Buchwald and Snake.
"
,,
2,15,"Yes. Yes, I rather like ""Snake"".
"
,,
2,15,"Snake Griffin.
"
,,
2,15,"Cookie!
"
,,
2,15,"Oh! Oh, you want my cookie?
"
,,
2,15,"Oh, yes, by all means. Here you are.
"
,,
2,15,"Oops, a little bit broke off there.
"
,,
2,15,"Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles!
"
,,
2,15,"Yes. Yes. Yes, you'II... you'll get that one
"
,,
2,15,"halfway back to your mat. Ha! Ha... Oh, God.
"
,,
2,15,"Oh, Cupid, hast thou pierced me
"
,,
2,15,"with thine sweet, searing arrow?
"
,,
2,15,"Stomach, cease thy lustful quake.
"
,,
2,15,"Argh! Unhand me, woman.
"
,,
2,15,"I don't have gas, I'm in love!
"
,,
2,15,"Well, then, I guess it's both.
"
,,
2,15,"Peter! I'm home!
"
,,
2,15,"How was your day?
"
,,
2,15,"Uh, my day?
"
,,
2,15,"Hey. Hey.
"
,,
2,15,"You OK there, Mr Crocodile? Huh?
"
,,
2,15,"Wake up, wake up, wake up.
"
,,
2,15,"You need some lotion, Mr Bad Skin?
"
,,
2,15,"Huh? Huh? Huh? There you go.
"
,,
2,15,"Agh! Agh! Agh! Agh!
"
,,
2,15,"Oh, God! Oh, God! Agh! Agh! Agh!
"
,,
2,15,"Oh, uh, my-my-my day was OK.
"
,,
2,15,"You know, the usual. How about yours,
"
,,
2,15,"my little sky princess? Bet it was excitin'.
"
,,
2,15,"Oh, yeah, if you like runnin' through
"
,,
2,15,"a gauntlet of drunk, horny businessmen.
"
,,
2,15,"My ass feels like a pincushion.
"
,,
2,15,"I'm thinkin' of quittin'.
"
,,
2,15,"What? Lois, you can't quit.
"
,,
2,15,"What if Kurt Cobain had quit?
"
,,
2,15,"Thank you. And remember, say no to drugs.
"
,,
2,15,"Kurt, the label's excited
"
,,
2,15,"about your seventh album.
"
,,
2,15,"Thanks. You remember
"
,,
2,15,"my wife Courtney Love?
"
,,
2,15,"Who?
"
,,
2,15,"Well, I guess I'll give it a little
"
,,
2,15,"more time. It's like I always tell the kids -
"
,,
2,15," A quitter never wins, and don't trust whitey.
"
,,
2,15," That's the spirit.
"
,,
2,15,"All right, here I go.
"
,,
2,15," Stewie!
"
,,
2,15," Hello, Janet. How about a push?
"
,,
2,15,"Argh!
"
,,
2,15,"Yes. Yes, I suppose that was
"
,,
2,15,"rather funny, wasn't it?
"
,,
2,15,"You know, it's odd, Janet, but when
"
,,
2,15,"I'm with you, I... Oh, how do I describe it?
"
,,
2,15,"Excuse me?
"
,,
2,15," I said ""May I have a blanket?""
"
,,
2,15," Oh, yes. Of course.
"
,,
2,15,"Ha! I said ""Will you be my wife?"" You said
"
,,
2,15,"yes, so it is official. Let me touch your face.
"
,,
2,15,"Lois, we could use your help in coach.
"
,,
2,15,"OK. Everyone? It's time
"
,,
2,15,"for my one-man show -
"
,,
2,15,"""Winston Churchill, We Hardly Knew Ye"".
"
,,
2,15,"OK, Act One.
"
,,
2,15,"I'm Winston Churchill.
"
,,
2,15,"Ooh, would you like some tea?
"
,,
2,15,"I would, because I'm Winston Churchill.
"
,,
2,15,"Would you like a crumpet?
"
,,
2,15,"I would, because I'm Winston Churchill.
"
,,
2,15,"Would you like to wear knickers?
"
,,
2,15,"I would, because I'm W...
"
,,
2,15," My wife is very ill!
"
,,
2,15," Yes, do you mind?
"
,,
2,15,"I paid $380 for this flight.
"
,,
2,15,"$380? Jeez, I hope they kissed you first.
"
,,
2,15,"This is my fourth trip today.
"
,,
2,15,"Just this mornin' I went to Kentucky.
"
,,
2,15,"Wait a second. You're tellin' me I flew all the
"
,,
2,15,"way to Kentucky to get some fried chicken,
"
,,
2,15,"and the Colonel isn't even workin' today?
"
,,
2,15,"He ain't real. He dead.
"
,,
2,15," What?
"
,,
2,15," I say he dead.
"
,,
2,15,"Is Mr Sanders in?
"
,,
2,15,"What wrong with you? I say you he dead.
"
,,
2,15,"The Colonel!
"
,,
2,15,"My wife is a stewardess, so I can
"
,,
2,15,"fly anywhere and I don't pay jack!
"
,,
2,15," Peter!
"
,,
2,15," Lois!
"
,,
2,15,"You convinced me to keep a job I hate
"
,,
2,15,"just so you could fly free?!
"
,,
2,15,"If I talked real loud like that,
"
,,
2,15,"I could make you look like the bad guy.
"
,,
2,15,"My feet are killing me,
"
,,
2,15,"I've got vomit in my pocket
"
,,
2,15,"and I've seen that crappy
"
,,
2,15,"Julia Roberts movie 47 times!
"
,,
2,15,"Have you seen the lips on that woman?
"
,,
2,15,"It's like a baboon's ass on her face!
"
,,
2,15,"Peter, I took this job for the excitement,
"
,,
2,15,"and you're the one who's havin' it all!
"
,,
2,15,"Oh, it's excitement you want, huh? Well,
"
,,
2,15,"how'd you like to join the Mile High Club?
"
,,
2,15,"Come on. You be the stewardess, and I'll be
"
,,
2,15,"the mysterious stranger who's drillin' you.
"
,,
2,15," Ugh! Move. I have a lot of work to do.
"
,,
2,15," I can't, I'm stuck.
"
,,
2,15," The passengers need me.
"
,,
2,15," They're watchin' the movie. They're fine.
"
,,
2,15,"OK, everyone, this is a hijacking.
"
,,
2,15,"Peter, could you move your arm, please?
"
,,
2,15," Uh. Yeah. Lois. Lois.
"
,,
2,15," Please. Move it over. Try to the...
"
,,
2,15," God, it's like movin' a futon.
"
,,
2,15," Lois!
"
,,
2,15," Just slide your leg over... Peter, please!
"
,,
2,15," Oh. Oh, no, no. Oh! Oh!
"
,,
2,15,"Well, Lois, at least one of us
"
,,
2,15,"is in the Mile High Club.
"
,,
2,15,"Well, the hijacking of Flight 52 is over.
"
,,
2,15,"The plane has safely landed in Cuba,
"
,,
2,15,"and all Americans aboard are on
"
,,
2,15,"their way home, except one couple -
"
,,
2,15,"a fat man who is inexplicably
"
,,
2,15,"married to an attractive redhead.
"
,,
2,15,"Here's an artist's rendering
"
,,
2,15,"of what they might look like.
"
,,
2,15,"I called Brian. He's gonna watch the kids till
"
,,
2,15,"we get back. When will our passports arrive?
"
,,
2,15," Check back in two weeks.
"
,,
2,15," Two weeks?! But I have a baby at home!
"
,,
2,15,"We would have sent you with the others, but
"
,,
2,15,"we didn't know you were stuck in the toilet.
"
,,
2,15," We weren't doin' what you're thinking.
"
,,
2,15," I was.
"
,,
2,15," We apologise for the hijacking.
"
,,
2,15," Ah, that's OK.
"
,,
2,15,"You people aren't like
"
,,
2,15,"the communists they show on TV.
"
,,
2,15,"We now return to ""The Communists"".
"
,,
2,15,"I hear report cards vere handed out today.
"
,,
2,15,"Vot were your grades?
"
,,
2,15,"Uh... uh... uh...
"
,,
2,15,"Qvit Stalin and answer your father.
"
,,
2,15,"Go ahead, honey, and tell us your... Marx.
"
,,
2,15," Do I Khrushchev?
"
,,
2,15," Did somebody say Khrushchev?
"
,,
2,15,"I say, Janet, do you like this couch?
"
,,
2,15,"Oh, you truly are beautiful, you know that?
"
,,
2,15," Oh, Janet, our future is so bright.
"
,,
2,15," Cookie?
"
,,
2,15,"Oh, yes, there'll be lots of cookies.
"
,,
2,15,"There'll be dancing, Christmas mornings,
"
,,
2,15,"and arguments over the proper
"
,,
2,15,"way to discipline the children, and...
"
,,
2,15,"What are you doing? What the hell is this?
"
,,
2,15,"Is there something you need to tell me? If I'm
"
,,
2,15,"the only one in this thing, I deserve to know.
"
,,
2,15,"I see. Your silence says it all.
"
,,
2,15,"This is great. How the hell
"
,,
2,15,"are we supposed to get home?
"
,,
2,15,"We gotta get some fake passports
"
,,
2,15,"on the black market.
"
,,
2,15,"Where are you going?
"
,,
2,15,"You're never gonna find the black market.
"
,,
2,15,"That's what you said about
"
,,
2,15,"that back-alley abortionist.
"
,,
2,15,"I'm glad you changed your mind.
"
,,
2,15,"But the point is, I found the guy.
"
,,
2,15,"OK, there she is. That is...
"
,,
2,15,"That is absolutely classic!
"
,,
2,15,"Melinda, you're an utter delight.
"
,,
2,15,"Oh, hello, Janet. Yes. Yes, you know Melinda.
"
,,
2,15,"Yes, it seems she's, um... Oh, what did we
"
,,
2,15,"figure out, dear? Was it one? No, two. Yes.
"
,,
2,15,"She's two weeks younger than you.
"
,,
2,15,"Just look at that butt. That is a tight butt.
"
,,
2,15,"Damn! Not even a second glance.
"
,,
2,15,"This is what you call dolled up? Why don't
"
,,
2,15,"you save yourself years of sexual ambiguity
"
,,
2,15,"and get fitted for a pair of Doc Martens
"
,,
2,15,"and a plaid flannel shirt?
"
,,
2,15,"There it is. The black market.
"
,,
2,15,"Lois, if we don't make it outta here alive,
"
,,
2,15,"I should tell ya I promised my first girlfriend
"
,,
2,15,"we'd meet up in heaven.
"
,,
2,15,"I was lyin', but just so you know
"
,,
2,15,"it's somethin' we might have to deal with.
"
,,
2,15,"OK. Two American passports.
"
,,
2,15,"Would you like to join the black market club?
"
,,
2,15," Ten per cent off your first purchase.
"
,,
2,15," No, thank you. We're not from the area.
"
,,
2,15,"Peter, just pay the man.
"
,,
2,15," Do you accept bits of string?
"
,,
2,15," Sorry. Store policy.
"
,,
2,15,"But, you know, there is
"
,,
2,15,"another way for you to travel.
"
,,
2,15,"It's over, Leonard. I suppose
"
,,
2,15,"I should be grateful to that saucy harlot.
"
,,
2,15,"She taught me a valuable lesson.
"
,,
2,15,"There's really no such thing as love.
"
,,
2,15,"It's just a word used by Madison Avenue
"
,,
2,15,"to sell their skin creams and two-seater cars.
"
,,
2,15,"Argh! It's no use! She swims
"
,,
2,15,"in my blood now. I must have her!
"
,,
2,15,"Darling, why are we tormenting ourselves?
"
,,
2,15,"We're perfect for each other.
"
,,
2,15,"I admit we've got our problems,
"
,,
2,15,"like any couple, but true love conquers all!
"
,,
2,15," I like you.
"
,,
2,15," You... like me?
"
,,
2,15,"Oh! Oh, well, it's not love, but it's a start.
"
,,
2,15,"Oh, Janet, you've made me
"
,,
2,15,"the happiest man in the whole world.
"
,,
2,15," Cookie?
"
,,
2,15," Of course you can have a cookie! Stay there.
"
,,
2,15,"Cookie.
"
,,
2,15,"Cookie?
"
,,
2,15,"Cookie?
"
,,
2,15,"Cookie?
"
,,
2,15,"You don't care about me. It's my cookies!
"
,,
2,15,"It's always been the damn cookies!
"
,,
2,15,"Well, sugar, the bakery just closed.
"
,,
2,15,"You'll have to get your fill somewhere else,
"
,,
2,15,"you oatmeal-raisin-Ioving tart!
"
,,
2,15,"Don't let her see you cry, old man.
"
,,
2,15,"Don't let her see you cry.
"
,,
2,15,"Well, we're finally goin' home.
"
,,
2,15,"I'm sorry I tricked you into that job, honey.
"
,,
2,15,"You deserve to have a more excitin' life.
"
,,
2,15,"Oh, Peter, bein' married to you
"
,,
2,15,"gives me all the excitement I can handle.
"
,,
2,15,"I mean, look at us-on a boat
"
,,
2,15,"in the middle of the Atlantic,
"
,,
2,15,"under the moonlight,
"
,,
2,15,"surrounded by refugees.
"
,,
2,15,"Yeah. Uh, about that. Uh...
"
,,
2,15,"Miguel over there has had his eye on you,
"
,,
2,15,"and his wife Rosa is very open.
"
,,
2,15," What?
"
,,
2,15," No, nothin'. This is nice.

"
,,
2,16,"He's a family guy
"
,,
2,16,"Wakey, wakey, worthless domestic.
"
,,
2,16,"Time to make the inedible gruel.
"
,,
2,16,"Mommy wants to rest for
"
,,
2,16,"a few more minutes, honey.
"
,,
2,16,"Blast!
"
,,
2,16,"Whaddaya doin' lyin' on the couch
"
,,
2,16,"at this hour? You been drinkin'?
"
,,
2,16," Peter, you know I never drink.
"
,,
2,16," Just like you never dodged the draft?
"
,,
2,16,"What are you talkin' about? I'm a woman.
"
,,
2,16,"Sure you are... now.
"
,,
2,16,"Peter, I'm exhausted.
"
,,
2,16,"I've been in and outta taxis all day.
"
,,
2,16,"Stewie had a doctor's appointment,
"
,,
2,16,"then I had to pick Meg up after school.
"
,,
2,16,"I had rehearsal for Death of a Salesman, 
"
,,
2,16,"but we can't show death at school,
"
,,
2,16,"so now at the end,
"
,,
2,16,"we dance around with sparklers.
"
,,
2,16,"Peter, we really need a second car.
"
,,
2,16,"Trying to do all these errands
"
,,
2,16,"in a taxi is exhausting.
"
,,
2,16,"Oh, but you meet such colourful characters
"
,,
2,16,"in taxis, like Alex Rieger and Tony.
"
,,
2,16,"And that funny foreign guy, in the garage.
"
,,
2,16,"Rieger, cab 402. Nardo, you and
"
,,
2,16,"your luscious melons are in 315.
"
,,
2,16," Now get outta here, you losers.
"
,,
2,16," What about the foreign guy?
"
,,
2,16,"No way. He's a nut job.
"
,,
2,16,"Show some compassion
"
,,
2,16,"for once in your miserable life.
"
,,
2,16,"All right, can the waterworks,
"
,,
2,16,"Jackie Chan, cab 302.
"
,,
2,16,"Ayii-a!
"
,,
2,16,"Thank you very much.
"
,,
2,16,"Peter, please. I saw an ad
"
,,
2,16,"for a used car that would be perfect.
"
,,
2,16,"Oh, no, Lois. A guy at work bought a car
"
,,
2,16,"outta the paper. Ten years later, bam! Herpes.
"
,,
2,16,"I'm buying our car
"
,,
2,16,"from a dealer and that's that.
"
,,
2,16,"Oh, look. Oh, aren't you beautiful?
"
,,
2,16,"Yeah. Yeah, you like that, don't ya?
"
,,
2,16,"Yeah, you're a bad little car.
"
,,
2,16,"What's that? What's that?
"
,,
2,16,"You want me inside ya?
"
,,
2,16,"Peter, look at this one. It's safe
"
,,
2,16,"and reliable and we can afford it.
"
,,
2,16,"I'll just see if I can find a salesman.
"
,,
2,16,"Hey, I'm Doug, nice to meet ya.
"
,,
2,16,"Whoa, have you lost weight?
"
,,
2,16,"It's still there. I'm parting it on the side.
"
,,
2,16,"We were more interested
"
,,
2,16,"in that car over there.
"
,,
2,16," Lois, let me handle this.
"
,,
2,16," Peter, this car has dents in it.
"
,,
2,16,"And it's got a cardboard steering wheel.
"
,,
2,16," Yeah, just a second, honey.
"
,,
2,16," And, look, there's no engine.
"
,,
2,16," It just has a drawing of an engine.
"
,,
2,16," But it only had one previous owner.
"
,,
2,16," James Bond.
"
,,
2,16," I'll take it.
"
,,
2,16,"OK, let's see what this baby can do, eh?
"
,,
2,16,"Ha! Well, I'm sure the dealer
"
,,
2,16,"will take care of it.
"
,,
2,16,"Lois, this is crazy.
"
,,
2,16,"There's no way we can have maritals
"
,,
2,16,"with you lying all the way over there.
"
,,
2,16,"I am very upset with you right now.
"
,,
2,16,"OK, so I tried on your bra.
"
,,
2,16,"Jeez, the fellas were puttin' on a show.
"
,,
2,16,"I didn't think I'd make a good Gigi either,
"
,,
2,16,"but, God help me, I was flattered.
"
,,
2,16,"Peter, I'm upset because
"
,,
2,16,"you never listen to me.
"
,,
2,16,"This is Atlantic City all over again.
"
,,
2,16," You've got 20.
"
,,
2,16," Hit me.
"
,,
2,16," 21.
"
,,
2,16," Hit me. Hit me.
"
,,
2,16," That's 30.
"
,,
2,16," Hit me.
"
,,
2,16,"Ha! You're just mad about the car.
"
,,
2,16,"Don't worry. I'll think of a way to fix it.
"
,,
2,16,"No, we'll think of a way to fix it.
"
,,
2,16,"I'm tired of being left out
"
,,
2,16,"of all our decision making.
"
,,
2,16,"OK, honey.
"
,,
2,16,"By the way, I bought a chimp.
"
,,
2,16,"Hey, Peter, you want a menu,
"
,,
2,16,"or just the usual everything?
"
,,
2,16," Aw, shut up, Cleveland.
"
,,
2,16," Wanna talk about it, champ?
"
,,
2,16,"Lois has had the car all week
"
,,
2,16,"and it's just been hell gettin' around.
"
,,
2,16,"I actually had to rent a Mustang.
"
,,
2,16,"All because I can't afford
"
,,
2,16,"to get our new car fixed.
"
,,
2,16,"Why don't you just get another new car?
"
,,
2,16,"Why don't you try a breath mint, saucy?
"
,,
2,16,"I'm just sayin' that
"
,,
2,16,"me and my associates will steal your car,
"
,,
2,16,"and ipso facto your insurance
"
,,
2,16,"company'll buy you another one.
"
,,
2,16,"Peter, you don't wanna
"
,,
2,16,"get involved with the Mob.
"
,,
2,16,"Who are you? Who are you?
"
,,
2,16,"Who are you? Who are you?
"
,,
2,16," I'm the proprietor of this delicatessen.
"
,,
2,16," Butt out, shlomo. All I need is your address.
"
,,
2,16," You can jot it down on the back of my gun.
"
,,
2,16," Well, you do have an honest face.
"
,,
2,16,"Ah, crap. I made a mistake.
"
,,
2,16,"Do you have another gun?
"
,,
2,16,"Dharma, come down from there. Wow, 
"
,,
2,16,"I can't get over what a free spirit you are. 
"
,,
2,16,"Lois, can you go down to the basement and
"
,,
2,16,"do somethin' really loud and complicated
"
,,
2,16,"for the next 15 minutes?
"
,,
2,16," That's a fine machine, Peter.
"
,,
2,16," Peter, how can we afford this?
"
,,
2,16,"Let's just say the car was a steal.
"
,,
2,16," Say that again.
"
,,
2,16," The car was a steal.
"
,,
2,16," This time without winking.
"
,,
2,16," The car was a steal.
"
,,
2,16,"Wink.
"
,,
2,16,"Look, Lois, we had a broken car, I did
"
,,
2,16,"""something"", and now we have a new car.
"
,,
2,16," Look, I said I'd handle it, and I did.
"
,,
2,16," I suppose you did.
"
,,
2,16,"I just wish my opinion mattered to you.
"
,,
2,16,"Well, the important thing is it matters to you.
"
,,
2,16,"And that's the greatest gift of all.
"
,,
2,16,"Hey, Cleveland, check out my on-board
"
,,
2,16,"computer navigation system. Standard.
"
,,
2,16," Left turn ahead.
"
,,
2,16," Spanish.
"
,,
2,16," Va a la izquierda all. 
"
,,
2,16," Yakov Smirnoff.
"
,,
2,16,"In Soviet Russia, car drives you. 
"
,,
2,16,"That's fancy an' all. But I think you're
"
,,
2,16,"bargainin' for more than you can chew.
"
,,
2,16,"You're in debt to the Mob. That means
"
,,
2,16,"they can ask you to do anything.
"
,,
2,16," Anything!
"
,,
2,16," Relax, Cleveland, there is no Mob.
"
,,
2,16,"You're thinkin' of the Mob in the movies.
"
,,
2,16," How am I funny?
"
,,
2,16," I dunno know. You say funny things.
"
,,
2,16,"No, no. I mean, am I George Carlin funny,
"
,,
2,16,"am I Spin City funny,
"
,,
2,16,"Rita Rudner funny, what? Come on.
"
,,
2,16," Rita Rudner funny.
"
,,
2,16," Yeah, Rita Rudner funny.
"
,,
2,16,"Really? Oh, my God. Thank you.
"
,,
2,16,"Peter, please don't underestimate them.
"
,,
2,16,"I guarantee ya, I am never gonna
"
,,
2,16,"hear from those guys again.
"
,,
2,16,"Peter, it is time to repay
"
,,
2,16,"your favour to the don.
"
,,
2,16,"Aw, jeez.
"
,,
2,16,"At least that's one problem solved.
"
,,
2,16,"C'mon, Peter, the don is waiting to meet you.
"
,,
2,16,"What kind of a guy... what's he like?
"
,,
2,16,"Is he a friendly don?
"
,,
2,16,"You know, like that Dom DeLuise.
"
,,
2,16,"I have asked you here tonight
"
,,
2,16,"so that you may perform a service.
"
,,
2,16,"Whaddaya gonna make me do?
"
,,
2,16,"Whack a guy? Off a guy? Whack off a guy?
"
,,
2,16,"Silence. Big Fat Paulie's in town this week
"
,,
2,16,"to attend the wedding of my daughter.
"
,,
2,16,"You want me to shoot him twice in the head.
"
,,
2,16,"That's sweet of you to ask,
"
,,
2,16,"but he's my nephew.
"
,,
2,16,"He's also vile and disgusting.
"
,,
2,16,"No one's been able to stand Big Fat Paulie's
"
,,
2,16,"company for more than a minute.
"
,,
2,16,"But you, Mr Griffin,
"
,,
2,16,"you will take him to the movies.
"
,,
2,16,"That's it? That's all I have to do?
"
,,
2,16,"Ah, thank Go... Wait a second. Which movie?
"
,,
2,16,"Because if it's anything with Greg Kinnear,
"
,,
2,16,"you can just whack me off right now.
"
,,
2,16,"Big Fat Paulie?
"
,,
2,16,"The name's Marty, and
"
,,
2,16,"I'm very sensitive about my weight.
"
,,
2,16," Big Fat Paulie?
"
,,
2,16," How dare you?
"
,,
2,16,"Are you Big Fat Paulie?
"
,,
2,16,"I'm Louie Anderson.
"
,,
2,16,"Are you-please, God - Big Fat Paulie?
"
,,
2,16," Yeah, I'm Big Fat Paulie.
"
,,
2,16," Hey. Guess I've got milk.
"
,,
2,16,"Don't shoot me!
"
,,
2,16,"Aw. Someone's sittin'
"
,,
2,16,"in my most favourite seat.
"
,,
2,16,"Hm. Hey, I just got a great idea.
"
,,
2,16,"Girlfriend, you know what time it is? 
"
,,
2,16," No, what time is it? 
"
,,
2,16," It's time for you to get your groove back. 
"
,,
2,16,"Again. 
"
,,
2,16,"Well, uh...
"
,,
2,16," Bye.
"
,,
2,16," Where you goin'?
"
,,
2,16," Home? You know, for dinner.
"
,,
2,16," Oh, yeah? What are we havin'?
"
,,
2,16,"Oh, uh... I was only supposed to
"
,,
2,16,"go to a movie with ya.
"
,,
2,16," What's that supposed to mean?
"
,,
2,16," Well, I mean, you know, like...
"
,,
2,16,"like no neckin'.
"
,,
2,16,"So I can have dinner with you.
"
,,
2,16,"Uh... uh, sure.
"
,,
2,16,"That'd be better than having dinner with
"
,,
2,16,"my family who I love and am not afraid of.
"
,,
2,16,"Hey, Lois, this is Big Fat Paulie.
"
,,
2,16," He's gonna be joinin' us for dinner.
"
,,
2,16," Really? What a nice surprise.
"
,,
2,16,"Peter, can I talk to you for a second?
"
,,
2,16,"You can't just bring company home
"
,,
2,16,"at the last second without calling.
"
,,
2,16,"I am gettin' tired of you doin' everything
"
,,
2,16,"without consultin' me. And...
"
,,
2,16," Do you mind?
"
,,
2,16," As a matter of fact, I do, you crazy broad.
"
,,
2,16,"I am not a crazy broad.
"
,,
2,16,"Oh, no, no, Lois. He didn't mean
"
,,
2,16,"you're crazy like Elizabeth Taylor.
"
,,
2,16,"You know, he meant you're crazy like...
"
,,
2,16,"like that glue. You stick to things.
"
,,
2,16,"You know, like an adhesive.
"
,,
2,16,"That's all he meant.
"
,,
2,16,"You have a pretty good appetite there, kid.
"
,,
2,16,"I bet you spend a lot of time in the john.
"
,,
2,16,"Sorry, what finishing school
"
,,
2,16,"did you say you went to?
"
,,
2,16,"Yes, good heavens. Who taught you
"
,,
2,16,"how to eat? Mickey Rourke?
"
,,
2,16,"Why do I know that name?
"
,,
2,16,"Damn you, Entertainment Tonight! 
"
,,
2,16,"Hi, I'm Bob Goen, 
"
,,
2,16,"and these are Mary Hart's legs. 
"
,,
2,16,"Mary, you recently spent some time
"
,,
2,16,"with Julia Roberts, didn't you? 
"
,,
2,16,"Mary says yes. 
"
,,
2,16,"Tell me, kid, what are you, like, 27?
"
,,
2,16," I'm 13.
"
,,
2,16," Still a minor, huh?
"
,,
2,16," Hey, son, how'd you like to be a coke mule?
"
,,
2,16," Peter, living room?
"
,,
2,16,"No, Lois, kitchen.
"
,,
2,16,"Peter, I have a bad feelin' about this man.
"
,,
2,16,"He's not the kind of person
"
,,
2,16,"I want hangin' around our family.
"
,,
2,16," Honey, you're overreactin'.
"
,,
2,16," Will you please just listen to me for once?
"
,,
2,16,"That man is bad news. I want him
"
,,
2,16,"out of our house and out of our lives.
"
,,
2,16,"I'm gonna give you
"
,,
2,16,"something to help you relax...
"
,,
2,16," Now!
"
,,
2,16," OK.
"
,,
2,16,"Big Fat Paulie?
"
,,
2,16,"There's somethin' I gotta tell ya.
"
,,
2,16,"Ever stare at the night sky and wonder
"
,,
2,16,"if someone might be lookin' back at ya?
"
,,
2,16,"No, but just in case...
"
,,
2,16,"Look at this, you freakin' aliens!
"
,,
2,16,"Oh, uh... Hi, Bonnie.
"
,,
2,16,"This is my friend, Big Fat Paulie,
"
,,
2,16,"and, uh... this is his big fat ass.
"
,,
2,16," What's on your mind, Petie?
"
,,
2,16," Look, uh, we can't be friends any more.
"
,,
2,16," Oh.
"
,,
2,16," I'm sorry.
"
,,
2,16,"Hey, forget about it.
"
,,
2,16,"Aw, jeez. It's not you, it's Lois.
"
,,
2,16,"She doesn't want me hangin' around with ya.
"
,,
2,16," Really? You're not just sayin' that?
"
,,
2,16," No, no. It's all Lois.
"
,,
2,16,"If only I'd met you first...
"
,,
2,16,"But whaddaya gonna do?
"
,,
2,16," So, Lois is the problem, huh?
"
,,
2,16," Yeah, but it's not her fault.
"
,,
2,16,"She just doesn't wanna see me
"
,,
2,16,"fall in with a tough crowd again.
"
,,
2,16,"Cavity creeps!
"
,,
2,16,"We make holes in teeth!
"
,,
2,16,"We make holes in teeth!
"
,,
2,16,"So, if she wasn't around,
"
,,
2,16,"we could still be friends, right?
"
,,
2,16," Yeah, sure. Why not?
"
,,
2,16," Oh, that's great.
"
,,
2,16,"Come here, you.
"
,,
2,16,"Willy Loman never made a lot of money,
"
,,
2,16,"his name was never in the paper,
"
,,
2,16,"but, uh... You know, like,
"
,,
2,16,"attention could be paid.
"
,,
2,16,"People are worse off than Willy Loman.
"
,,
2,16,"Jeez, come on, everybody.
"
,,
2,16,"I know it sucks, but they're just kids.
"
,,
2,16,"Peter, how can you sleep?
"
,,
2,16,"I was almost killed.
"
,,
2,16,"Aw, come on, Lois. The only victim
"
,,
2,16,"tonight was the work of Arthur Miller.
"
,,
2,16,"Hello.
"
,,
2,16,"Hey, Big Fat Paulie.
"
,,
2,16,"No, Lois isn't dead yet.
"
,,
2,16,"Whaddaya mean,
"
,,
2,16,"you're gonna fire that hit man?
"
,,
2,16,"Whaddaya mean, you thought she'd be six
"
,,
2,16,"feet under and we'd be able to catch a movie?
"
,,
2,16,"Whad...?
"
,,
2,16," You thought I wanted you to whack Lois?
"
,,
2,16," Guilty.
"
,,
2,16," It's not too late to have the hit called off?
"
,,
2,16," Yeah.
"
,,
2,16,"Gotcha.
"
,,
2,16,"All I gotta do is make a call.
"
,,
2,16,"Aw, jeez. You OK?
"
,,
2,16,"Oh, my God. Look at this.
"
,,
2,16,"How could you bring a mobster
"
,,
2,16,"into your own home?
"
,,
2,16,"If you're upset now, wait till ya hear the rest.
"
,,
2,16,"I was talkin' to Big Fat Paulie the other day
"
,,
2,16,"and one thing led to another, and...
"
,,
2,16," I sort of put a hit out on ya.
"
,,
2,16," How could you put a hit on me?
"
,,
2,16,"That's not even the worst part.
"
,,
2,16,"Wait. Yeah, it is.
"
,,
2,16," Peter!
"
,,
2,16," Look, don't worry. I got it all worked out.
"
,,
2,16,"We'll move to England. Worst they got there
"
,,
2,16,"is, uh, you know, drive-by arguments.
"
,,
2,16,"I say, Jeremy, isn't that
"
,,
2,16,"Reginald B Stiffworth,
"
,,
2,16,"the chap who's been touting the merits
"
,,
2,16,"of a United European Commonwealth?
"
,,
2,16," Why, yes, I dare say that's the fellow.
"
,,
2,16," Oh, let's get him.
"
,,
2,16,"Oh, Reginald.
"
,,
2,16,"I disagree.
"
,,
2,16," I would like a ""bunny"".
"
,,
2,16," What kind of ""bunny""?
"
,,
2,16,"A semi-automatic bunny
"
,,
2,16,"or a hand-held bunny.
"
,,
2,16,"Whichever bunny you think is better
"
,,
2,16,"for shooting a guy in the head.
"
,,
2,16,"I've been lookin' all over for ya.
"
,,
2,16,"Look, I gotta call off the hit on my wife.
"
,,
2,16," Where's the don?
"
,,
2,16," The don?
"
,,
2,16," I don't know what you're talking about.
"
,,
2,16," Aw, come on, you know, the don.
"
,,
2,16," The captain of the Mafia.
"
,,
2,16," Peter, there is no such thing as the Mafia.
"
,,
2,16,"""The don's daughter is getting married
"
,,
2,16,"tomorrow. Here's my invitation.""
"
,,
2,16,"""Now, get the asterisk, percent,

2,16,"ampersand, out of here, you SOB.""

"

2,16," Dharma, come down from that couch. 
"
,,
2,16," Uh-uh, goofy. Why don't you come up? 
"
,,
2,16,"You know what? I think I will. 
"
,,
2,16,"Boy, what a mismatched pair.
"
,,
2,16,"A free spirit and a puppet.
"
,,
2,16,"Peter, thank God. Did you take care of...
"
,,
2,16," That thing?
"
,,
2,16," That thing? Oh, oh, you mean that growth.
"
,,
2,16,"Yeah, I had the doctor look at that.
"
,,
2,16,"Mr Griffin, that isn't a growth.
"
,,
2,16,"That's your penis.
"
,,
2,16,"Oh. Well, what about the...?
"
,,
2,16,"Testicles.
"
,,
2,16,"Huh.
"
,,
2,16," I'm talkin' about the mob hit.
"
,,
2,16," Mom's gonna get whacked?
"
,,
2,16," What did you do?
"
,,
2,16," Oh dear, there are so many people to thank.
"
,,
2,16,"God, of course, and um... who else?
"
,,
2,16,"Oh, this is so unexpected.
"
,,
2,16," Oh, yes, Satan.
"
,,
2,16," I'm sorry, Lois. The hit's still on.
"
,,
2,16," All I got was this wedding invitation.
"
,,
2,16," Wait a second, Peter.
"
,,
2,16,"The don's daughter's wedding. That's perfect.
"
,,
2,16,"It's not that perfect.
"
,,
2,16,"We'll probably have to buy a gift.
"
,,
2,16,"And you know how bad I am at buyin' gifts.
"
,,
2,16,"Happy freakin' birthday, Lois.
"
,,
2,16,"Oh, my goodness. It's a...
"
,,
2,16,"Ah, another sword.
"
,,
2,16," Thank you, Peter.
"
,,
2,16," Go ahead, try it on.
"
,,
2,16,"Didn't you see The Godfather?  The don can't
"
,,
2,16,"refuse a favour on his daughter's wedding.
"
,,
2,16," So?
"
,,
2,16," So we can ask him for a favour.
"
,,
2,16," So?
"
,,
2,16," So we ask him to call off the hit.
"
,,
2,16," So?
"
,,
2,16," So...
"
,,
2,16,"Peter, I don't know how
"
,,
2,16,"to explain it any clearer than that.
"
,,
2,16,"You can ask them not to kill Mom.
"
,,
2,16,"No way, it's too dangerous.
"
,,
2,16,"I got you into this and I'll get you out of it.
"
,,
2,16,"No, Peter, when we got married
"
,,
2,16,"we agreed to share our lives.
"
,,
2,16," Good times and bad.
"
,,
2,16," So?
"
,,
2,16," So we'll solve this problem.
"
,,
2,16," Wait. You mean, together?
"
,,
2,16,"Yes, because together we can do anything,
"
,,
2,16,"face any foe, overcome any obstacle.
"
,,
2,16,"Yeah, climb any mountain,
"
,,
2,16,"rent any video, dial any phone.
"
,,
2,16,"And not just our phone,
"
,,
2,16,"Lois, other people's phones.
"
,,
2,16,"Decent phones, God-fearing phones,
"
,,
2,16,"phones that everybody else gave up on,
"
,,
2,16,"but we knew better, because we were a team.
"
,,
2,16,"What the hell are you talking about?
"
,,
2,16,"Turn right at fork in road.
"
,,
2,16," In Soviet Russia, road forks you. 
"
,,
2,16," Boy, is that gettin' old.
"
,,
2,16,"I don't know. What if somethin' happens
"
,,
2,16,"to ya? I'm too old to start dating again.
"
,,
2,16,"OK, bachelor number one. I'm an ice-cream
"
,,
2,16,"cone. How are you gonna eat me?
"
,,
2,16,"I'd invite my friend Rudy over and
"
,,
2,16,"the two of us would give you a double dip.
"
,,
2,16,"OK. Bachelor number two?
"
,,
2,16,"I'd lick off all the cream and
"
,,
2,16,"give you my special whip topping.
"
,,
2,16,"Sounds good. Bachelor number three?
"
,,
2,16,"Well, I would try to eat you
"
,,
2,16,"really fast, before I got flaccid.
"
,,
2,16," I'll be fine. All we have to do is blend in.
"
,,
2,16," No problem.
"
,,
2,16,"For my next number...
"
,,
2,16,"Thank you very much.
"
,,
2,16," David Schwimmer?
"
,,
2,16," Yeah. Hey.
"
,,
2,16," What are you gonna ask the don for?
"
,,
2,16," World peace.
"
,,
2,16," Number 34. Three-four.
"
,,
2,16," Right here.
"
,,
2,16,"Peter, my good friend. How good of you
"
,,
2,16,"to come and show your respect,
"
,,
2,16,"on this, the day of my daughter's wedding.
"
,,
2,16,"Yeah, sorry I didn't bring a gift,
"
,,
2,16,"but the stores were mobbed.
"
,,
2,16,"Uh, I mean, mobbed as in crowded.
"
,,
2,16,"Not... not mobbed as in... you guys.
"
,,
2,16,"Who is this enchanting woman?
"
,,
2,16,"This is my wife, Lois. Ah!
"
,,
2,16,"Your honour, sir, we've come to ask...
"
,,
2,16," Let me handle this.
"
,,
2,16," Peter, I thought we were a team.
"
,,
2,16,"Listen, Your Don-ness.
"
,,
2,16,"I got a little favour to ask.
"
,,
2,16,"Go ahead. I am obligated to grant one favour
"
,,
2,16,"on this, the day of my daughter's wedding.
"
,,
2,16,"While you ask me for this
"
,,
2,16,"one and only favour,
"
,,
2,16,"I will sit here and enjoy
"
,,
2,16,"this very fine tiramisu.
"
,,
2,16," Oh, can I have a piece?
"
,,
2,16," Granted.
"
,,
2,16," Next.
"
,,
2,16," Aw, crap.
"
,,
2,16,"I'm sorry I used up our favour, Lois.
"
,,
2,16,"You know what? Here. It's yours.
"
,,
2,16,"No, no, really. I insist.
"
,,
2,16,"Peter, I'm gonna be killed.
"
,,
2,16,"Does that mean nothing to you?
"
,,
2,16,"Of course it does.
"
,,
2,16,"It means everything to me.
"
,,
2,16," Oh, God. What have I done?
"
,,
2,16," I'm not marrying you.
"
,,
2,16,"I'm not marrying you,
"
,,
2,16,"you spoiled guinea... Whoops.
"
,,
2,16,"My daughter, what is the problem on this,
"
,,
2,16,"the day of my daughter's wedding?
"
,,
2,16,"Larry wants to whack someone
"
,,
2,16,"on our honeymoon.
"
,,
2,16,"Hey, it's my job, all right?
"
,,
2,16,"This is what I do.
"
,,
2,16,"You two should stop fighting
"
,,
2,16,"and listen to each other.
"
,,
2,16,"See, marriage is a partnership. If you really
"
,,
2,16,"love someone, you gotta work together,
"
,,
2,16,"as a team. I... I learned that the hard way.
"
,,
2,16,"I didn't listen to what my wife had to say
"
,,
2,16,"and now she's as good as dead.
"
,,
2,16," Oh, Peter.
"
,,
2,16," That's awful. Is this your wife?
"
,,
2,16,"Yeah, that's Lois. Ah!
"
,,
2,16,"I guess we could postpone our trip.
"
,,
2,16,"We won't have to. I don't believe this.
"
,,
2,16,"She's the one I'm supposed to whack.
"
,,
2,16," Peter.
"
,,
2,16," Please, you gotta do me one more favour.
"
,,
2,16,"Look, I love my wife
"
,,
2,16,"more than anything in the world.
"
,,
2,16,"Can you please shoot me instead of her?
"
,,
2,16,"Such tenderness and love on this,
"
,,
2,16,"the day of my daughter's wedding.
"
,,
2,16," Why don't I just call off the hit?
"
,,
2,16," Oh. Yeah, that could work.
"
,,
2,16,"Wait. We're a team. Is that OK with you?
"
,,
2,16,"Because your opinion matters too.
"
,,
2,16,"Yes, let's get the hell outta here.
"
,,
2,16,"Thank you for a lovely time.
"
,,
2,16," Yeah, it's the blue sedan.
"
,,
2,16," No tip, sir.
"
,,
2,16,"Ah, nice kid. Well, I think
"
,,
2,16,"I handled that pretty good.
"
,,
2,16,"But... but I would like a second opinion.
"
,,
2,16,"Here it is.
"
,,
2,16," Oh, my God, our car!
"
,,
2,16," Man, am I glad I caught you.
"
,,
2,16,"I almost forgot. Don't start your car...
"
,,
2,16," Hey, thanks for comin'.
"
,,
2,16," Oh, what a horrible night.
"
,,
2,16,"It's not so bad, Lois. I learned my lesson.
"
,,
2,16,"And best of all, nobody important got hurt.

2,17,"is a symphony of flavour.
"
,,
2,17,"It's too bad you can't have some -
"
,,
2,17,"it's practically orgasmic!
"
,,
2,17,"Oh, yes! Yes!
"
,,
2,17,"Oh! Oh!
"
,,
2,17," Yes! Yes!
"
,,
2,17," I'll have what he's having.
"
,,
2,17,"OK, Chris, time for some good old-fashioned
"
,,
2,17,"exercise-like those guys are doin'.
"
,,
2,17,"I say, Phineas, great day
"
,,
2,17,"to be doing squat thrusts
"
,,
2,17,"and lifting our huge
"
,,
2,17,"triangular iron weights.
"
,,
2,17," Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!
"
,,
2,17," Hup! Hup-hup! Hup! Hup!
"
,,
2,17,"Dad, I don't like running. The sound of
"
,,
2,17,"my thighs scraping together hurts my ears.
"
,,
2,17,"Hey, a Twinkie! A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
"
,,
2,17,"A-ha-ha! I'm gonna get you!
"
,,
2,17,"Come on! You can do it.
"
,,
2,17,"Feel the burn, Chris. Feel the burn.
"
,,
2,17,"Agh!
"
,,
2,17,"Attaboy. All the way upstream, buddy.
"
,,
2,17,"Agh! Agh! Aagh! Aagh! Agh!
"
,,
2,17,"OK, just relax.
"
,,
2,17,"Try to soil yourself, like we practised.
"
,,
2,17,"Dad, this says I gained weight.
"
,,
2,17,"That's impossible. Take off your shirt.
"
,,
2,17,"What the hell is that?
"
,,
2,17,"Bovine lummox! Oh!
"
,,
2,17,"Oh, God!
"
,,
2,17,"I tell ya, he's been workin' out
"
,,
2,17,"all week and he hasn't lost a pound.
"
,,
2,17,"Peter, if you're this desperate about Chris's
"
,,
2,17,"weight, why don't you just suck the fat out?
"
,,
2,17,"If you can find a hole on the boy that
"
,,
2,17,"you wanna put your lips on, be my guest.
"
,,
2,17,"I'm talkin' about liposuction.
"
,,
2,17,"My brother Broderick's a cosmetic surgeon.
"
,,
2,17,"Is he good?
"
,,
2,17,"Well, Nell Carter used to be twice as big
"
,,
2,17,"before Broderick got through with her.
"
,,
2,17,"FYI, he used the fat he took out of her
"
,,
2,17,"to make the two kids from Good Burger. 
"
,,
2,17,"This is a very safe procedure, son.
"
,,
2,17,"You won't feel a thing.
"
,,
2,17,"I'm like a Green Beret, you know.
"
,,
2,17,"I sneak inside you and I skulk around
"
,,
2,17,"like it's Vietnam or somethin', and
"
,,
2,17,"I'm sneakin' through the bush, you know.
"
,,
2,17,"And I get all that fat, like the fat's my buddies
"
,,
2,17,"stuck behind enemy lines, you know.
"
,,
2,17,"And when I got all my buddies,
"
,,
2,17,"I sneak out again.
"
,,
2,17,"I'm very mysterious when I'm inside you,
"
,,
2,17,"you know, like a... like the wind, you know.
"
,,
2,17,"Oh, good boy, Stewie. Clean plate.
"
,,
2,17,"Although I think you got...
"
,,
2,17,"Yes, yes, I got more of it on me than in me.
"
,,
2,17,"Yes, that one never gets old, Lois.
"
,,
2,17,"Here's your dessert, sweetie. Dig in.
"
,,
2,17," I'll eat it when I'm ready.
"
,,
2,17," Hi!
"
,,
2,17,"I'm ready. Well, time for dessert, isn't it?
"
,,
2,17,"Let's see, big chocolate cake for Stewie,
"
,,
2,17,"and we have something very tasty
"
,,
2,17,"for big fat you. Bon apptit! 
"
,,
2,17,"Oh, and feel free to use my fork,
"
,,
2,17,"I shan't be needing it. Watch me.
"
,,
2,17,"That's it. Watch this.
"
,,
2,17,"Oh, Stewie! Stop eatin' like a little piggy!
"
,,
2,17,"We should cut down on your sweets-you're
"
,,
2,17,"gettin' a belly. Chris, where have you been?
"
,,
2,17,"Dad took me to a doctor to get
"
,,
2,17,"the fat vacuumed out of my belly.
"
,,
2,17," What?
"
,,
2,17," I didn't do it.
"
,,
2,17,"I'm just gonna stay on my diet and exercise.
"
,,
2,17,"Good for you. That was
"
,,
2,17,"a very grown-up decision.
"
,,
2,17,"I mean, what kinda lazy, narcissistic,
"
,,
2,17,"irresponsible moron would even consider
"
,,
2,17,"doing something as unbelievably foolish as
"
,,
2,17,"getting liposuction? Who, I ask you? Who?
"
,,
2,17,"Hello!
"
,,
2,17,"I... How... Wha...
"
,,
2,17,"My God, it's finally happened.
"
,,
2,17,"He's become so massive he's collapsed
"
,,
2,17,"into himself like a neutron star.
"
,,
2,17," Mom, can I get lipo too?
"
,,
2,17," Forget it, Meg.
"
,,
2,17,"Peter, you can't just suck 200Ibs of fat
"
,,
2,17,"out of yourself. It's not natural.
"
,,
2,17,"Come on. Lois, I feel great
"
,,
2,17,"droppin' that kind of weight all at once.
"
,,
2,17,"Like you felt after you had Chris.
"
,,
2,17,"And they're off!
"
,,
2,17,"Well, then, giddy-up.
"
,,
2,17,"A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
"
,,
2,17," Great to be thin.
"
,,
2,17," Yup.
"
,,
2,17,"You know, there's somethin'
"
,,
2,17,"I always wanted to do, Brian,
"
,,
2,17,"but, uh... I-I could never do it
"
,,
2,17,"cos I was so heavy.
"
,,
2,17,"But, you know, now that I don't
"
,,
2,17,"weigh so much, I think I can.
"
,,
2,17," Could you... could you help me do it, Brian?
"
,,
2,17," Sure. I'd be honoured.
"
,,
2,17,"I was wonderin' if I could put a little saddle
"
,,
2,17,"on your back and ride you like a horsy.
"
,,
2,17,"Oh, OK. No, I understand.
"
,,
2,17,"It's too much. It's OK.
"
,,
2,17,"I like Hillary Clinton, I don't care
"
,,
2,17,"what anyone says. Argh!
"
,,
2,17," Hyah! Hyah! Come on, Old Paint!
"
,,
2,17," I can feel the bones in your ass!
"
,,
2,17,"I see you!
"
,,
2,17,"But, Mom, it could change my life!
"
,,
2,17,"Meg, you're not gettin' plastic surgery.
"
,,
2,17,"Why not? It's totally safe.
"
,,
2,17,"A lot of famous people have done it.
"
,,
2,17,"Your place is here in the ice village. You
"
,,
2,17,"know nothing of Hollywood and its ways.
"
,,
2,17,"But, Father, I have dreams and courage and
"
,,
2,17,"the name of an excellent cosmetic surgeon.
"
,,
2,17,"Fear not, some day word will reach you
"
,,
2,17,"about the success of me,
"
,,
2,17,"the great Eskimo actor Jennifer Love Hewitt.
"
,,
2,17," Bring pride to our village!
"
,,
2,17," Send firewood!
"
,,
2,17,"Plastic surgery is great! I was thinkin' about
"
,,
2,17,"havin' Broderick take a look at my nose.
"
,,
2,17,"It doesn't matter if your nose
"
,,
2,17,"is a little bulbousy,
"
,,
2,17,"or your eyes are too close together,
"
,,
2,17,"or your chest is flabby. You are who you are.
"
,,
2,17,"Huh. I think I know what you're gettin' at.
"
,,
2,17,"Knock, knock!
"
,,
2,17,"Hey, pal, you can't just walk in here...
"
,,
2,17,"Holy crap, it's Peter.
"
,,
2,17," Dad, you're pretty! Like a girl!
"
,,
2,17," You look like a totally different person.
"
,,
2,17,"Oh, this is crazy. You walk in here
"
,,
2,17,"with your chiselled jaw and your...
"
,,
2,17,"Oh, my! I...
"
,,
2,17,"I liked you the way you were.
"
,,
2,17,"You're not even real any more. You're...
"
,,
2,17," Peter, did you get a new buttocks?
"
,,
2,17," I had to. My old one had a crack in it.
"
,,
2,17,"Well, I couldn't be more angry with you.
"
,,
2,17,"Ahhhhh!
"
,,
2,17,"You... you've really let this family down. We
"
,,
2,17,"should be embracin' the things God gave us,
"
,,
2,17,"not tellin' our kids a person's not as good as
"
,,
2,17,"someone else because of the way they look.
"
,,
2,17,"Agh! Holy crap!
"
,,
2,17,"Ow!
"
,,
2,17," There's a baby in that refuse bin.
"
,,
2,17," Not too close, Barnaby.
"
,,
2,17," If you touch it, the mother won't take it back.
"
,,
2,17," Allez-oop!
"
,,
2,17,"Excuse me, sir, what is a handsome man
"
,,
2,17,"like you doing waiting in line?
"
,,
2,17,"I need an adult! I need an adult!
"
,,
2,17,"Warren Fredericks, Quahog Beautiful
"
,,
2,17,"People's Club. Come on in front.
"
,,
2,17,"But all those people were in front of me.
"
,,
2,17,"You haven't been beautiful long, have you?
"
,,
2,17,"Gorgeous guys like us don't have to wait.
"
,,
2,17,"Haven't you noticed?
"
,,
2,17,"People will do anything
"
,,
2,17,"for a beautiful person.
"
,,
2,17,"Yeah. You know, come to think of it...
"
,,
2,17,"Hi. I'm on a scavenger hunt,
"
,,
2,17,"and I need a human foot.
"
,,
2,17,"Well, as a rule, I would say no,
"
,,
2,17,"but OK, come in.
"
,,
2,17,"So this is, what, for, like, a school project?
"
,,
2,17,"Argh! Argh! Agh! Agh!
"
,,
2,17,"Raul, please take this
"
,,
2,17,"handsome gentleman's bags to his car.
"
,,
2,17,"Thank you.
"
,,
2,17,"Hey, when you're beautiful,
"
,,
2,17,"doors magically open for you.
"
,,
2,17,"It opened because you stepped on
"
,,
2,17,"that black rubber square.
"
,,
2,17,"If that wasn't there, it would've
"
,,
2,17,"opened anyway cos you're beautiful.
"
,,
2,17,"Wow.
"
,,
2,17,"There's a lot of good-Iookin' people here.
"
,,
2,17,"This is the Beautiful People's Club,
"
,,
2,17,"and you're our newest member.
"
,,
2,17,"Here's your introductory basket.
"
,,
2,17,"It's got lotions, Ferrari sunglasses,
"
,,
2,17,"and pills to make your bowel movements
"
,,
2,17,"smell like bakery-fresh cinnamon rolls.
"
,,
2,17,"Argh! Dammit!
"
,,
2,17,"Oh, what happened? Orson fall down?
"
,,
2,17,"Shut up! Just... I don't want to hear it!
"
,,
2,17,"Serves you right. You tried to make Chris
"
,,
2,17,"jealous, now you have an eating disorder.
"
,,
2,17,"Just help me up.
"
,,
2,17,"I would, but my doctor
"
,,
2,17,"advised me against heavy lifting. 
"
,,
2,17,"Oh, ha-de-ha-ha!
"
,,
2,17,"What the... What the devil are you doing?
"
,,
2,17,"Stop it! Stop it, I'm getting dizzy!
"
,,
2,17,"Argh! Blast!
"
,,
2,17,"Did you paste a new picture of yourself
"
,,
2,17,"on our wedding portrait?
"
,,
2,17," Yeah. I think it looks better.
"
,,
2,17," You pasted it over me.
"
,,
2,17," Yeah. I think it looks better.
"
,,
2,17," Have you lost your mind?
"
,,
2,17," Well, somebody's jealous.
"
,,
2,17," Have you forgotten about Chris?
"
,,
2,17," He needs you to help him exercise.
"
,,
2,17," He figured out how to catch the Twinkie.
"
,,
2,17,"Ha-ha! I'm turnin' you into poo.
"
,,
2,17,"I'm goin' to the Beautiful People's
"
,,
2,17,"Club. I can take him with me.
"
,,
2,17,"Seein' us all might give him
"
,,
2,17,"somethin' to shoot for.
"
,,
2,17,"The Beautiful People's Club?
"
,,
2,17,"How come I never heard of it?
"
,,
2,17,"Lois, I can't say any more. I'm probably
"
,,
2,17,"already in trouble for mentioning it to a, uh...
"
,,
2,17,"Well, we call you ""normies"".
"
,,
2,17,"OK, bye.
"
,,
2,17,"Are you gonna take that?
"
,,
2,17," Lois!
"
,,
2,17," What? Oh. Brian. I was...
"
,,
2,17,"I was seeing if the, uh, driveway.
"
,,
2,17,"That wasn't a sentence.
"
,,
2,17,"You were ogling Peter like a horny schoolgirl.
"
,,
2,17,"Oh, I can't help it! I know, I know,
"
,,
2,17,"he's become a superficial, egomaniacal jerk.
"
,,
2,17,"But I've never been more attracted to him.
"
,,
2,17,"Does that make me a bad person?
"
,,
2,17,"Yes. Yes, it does make you a bad person.
"
,,
2,17,"Peter, good to see you. I've got a lot of tall,
"
,,
2,17,"statuesque people I want you to meet.
"
,,
2,17," What's that?
"
,,
2,17," Oh, that's my son Chris.
"
,,
2,17,"He can't come in. He's fat.
"
,,
2,17,"Well, let me tell you somethin', buddy.
"
,,
2,17,"If my son can't come in, then I'll just come in.
"
,,
2,17," See you at home.
"
,,
2,17," But Dad...
"
,,
2,17,"Trust me, Chris, sometimes
"
,,
2,17,"it's better not to fit in.
"
,,
2,17,"You're all stupid.
"
,,
2,17,"They're gonna be lookin' for army guys.
"
,,
2,17,"Don't look at me! I'm hideous!
"
,,
2,17,"How could you treat Chris that way? You
"
,,
2,17,"know he's self-conscious about his weight.
"
,,
2,17,"What you gettin' mad at me for?
"
,,
2,17,"He gets his fat from your genes.
"
,,
2,17," Which, by the way, I'm wearing.
"
,,
2,17," Oh, I hate what you've become!
"
,,
2,17,"Why don't you have that doctor
"
,,
2,17,"suck the fat outta your head?!
"
,,
2,17,"Maybe I will. Then I'll put it on my feet
"
,,
2,17,"and skate on Paul Bunyan's
"
,,
2,17,"giant skillet to cook his flapjacks!
"
,,
2,17," That doesn't make any sense.
"
,,
2,17," It doesn't have to. I'm beautiful!
"
,,
2,17,"You're not welcome here. Go away!
"
,,
2,17,"Wow, Chris, did you lose weight?
"
,,
2,17,"Maybe. I've been workin' out.
"
,,
2,17,"Well, you look wicked skinny.
"
,,
2,17,"I'm, like, jealous.
"
,,
2,17,"Thanks, Meg. I'm jealous of your moustache.
"
,,
2,17,"I don't have a moustache. Do I?
"
,,
2,17,"Oh, honey, it's fine.
"
,,
2,17,"It makes you look distinguished.
"
,,
2,17," But Mom...
"
,,
2,17," Meg, I think all my children are beautiful.
"
,,
2,17,"Damn you, ice cream. Come to my mouth.
"
,,
2,17,"How dare you disobey me?
"
,,
2,17,"What are you looking at,
"
,,
2,17,"you... you infantile, stupid...
"
,,
2,17,"That's right. Damn you and such.
"
,,
2,17,"You can... burn in hell.
"
,,
2,17,"She is so jealous. Of course - I'm beautiful.
"
,,
2,17,"I mean, look at me.
"
,,
2,17,"Oh... How strange...
"
,,
2,17,"Should... watch... road,
"
,,
2,17,"but... can't... look... away.
"
,,
2,17,"Too beautiful.
"
,,
2,17,"Well, Mr Griffin, the bandages
"
,,
2,17,"are ready to come off.
"
,,
2,17,"But I should tell you
"
,,
2,17,"it's a miracle you're alive at all.
"
,,
2,17,"We did all we can,
"
,,
2,17,"but medical science has come just so far.
"
,,
2,17,"And now I will take off
"
,,
2,17,"this protective Potato Head mask.
"
,,
2,17,"Oh, Peter, you look like you!
"
,,
2,17,"I can't believe you're all still standin'
"
,,
2,17,"by my side after what a jerk I was.
"
,,
2,17," Especially to you. I'm sorry, Chris.
"
,,
2,17," That's OK, Dad.
"
,,
2,17,"Well, Peter, I guess
"
,,
2,17,"you learned a pretty valuable lesson.
"
,,
2,17,"Nope.

2,18,"a cold, it would sound like ""Ballard"".
"
,,
2,18," Do you listen when you talk?
"
,,
2,18," I drift in and out.
"
,,
2,18,"You know, Rupert, the word ""gullible""
"
,,
2,18,"is not in the dictionary.
"
,,
2,18,"Oh, oh, you don't believe me?
"
,,
2,18,"Here! Look it up!
"
,,
2,18,"What? What's that? It really isn't?
"
,,
2,18,"Oh, Rupert, touch!
"
,,
2,18,"Hoisted by my own petard!
"
,,
2,18,"Ah, I am so alone.
"
,,
2,18,"Everybody, my tax refund is here. I'm gonna
"
,,
2,18,"buy us somethin' we've always wanted.
"
,,
2,18," A cat?
"
,,
2,18," A stereo?
"
,,
2,18," A pool?
"
,,
2,18," Oh, oh, I'm sorry. It is a pool.
"
,,
2,18," Oh, joy unbounded!
"
,,
2,18," I'll feed it and take care of it!
"
,,
2,18,"Oh, my God! It's better than I thought.
"
,,
2,18,"An Audi! I'm gettin' a car!
"
,,
2,18,"Uh, Peter, there's a ""T"" in there.
"
,,
2,18,"That says ""audit"".
"
,,
2,18,"No, Brian, it's a foreign car. The ""T"" is silent.
"
,,
2,18," Sweet! I'm gettin' an Audi!
"
,,
2,18," I have an ""inny"".
"
,,
2,18," Uh, Miss Stratford?
"
,,
2,18," Come in, Mr Griffin. Don't be nervous.
"
,,
2,18,"The IRS is much kinder and gentler
"
,,
2,18,"than we used to be.
"
,,
2,18," You smell nice.
"
,,
2,18," What? Oh, that... that must be you.
"
,,
2,18," No, it couldn't be me. I just farted.
"
,,
2,18," Oh.
"
,,
2,18,"I just have a few questions about your return.
"
,,
2,18,"Did you incur
"
,,
2,18,"any medical expenses this year?
"
,,
2,18,"You can write off medical stuff? If I'd known,
"
,,
2,18,"I wouldn't have used a discount surgeon.
"
,,
2,18,"Uh, I'm not sure which one to cut here.
"
,,
2,18,"The red one... or the blue one...
"
,,
2,18,"OK, OK, just relax. Let's see, uh...
"
,,
2,18,"First, why don't you attach
"
,,
2,18,"that green one to that purple one?
"
,,
2,18,"OK. Here goes.
"
,,
2,18," Oh, God!
"
,,
2,18," That kill me?
"
,,
2,18," Uh-huh.
"
,,
2,18," I was afraid of that. Try the green and blue.
"
,,
2,18,"Well, Mr Griffin,
"
,,
2,18,"you don't owe any additional money,
"
,,
2,18,"but unfortunately,
"
,,
2,18,"you're not entitled to a refund.
"
,,
2,18," Aah!
"
,,
2,18," Mr Griffin, are you OK?
"
,,
2,18,"I'm sorry. I still haven't
"
,,
2,18,"gotten over the loss of Party of Five. 
"
,,
2,18,"It'll take time to get over it.
"
,,
2,18,"What were you sayin'?
"
,,
2,18," You're not entitled to a refund.
"
,,
2,18," Aah!
"
,,
2,18," I'm sorry. Come again?
"
,,
2,18," You're not entitled to a refund.
"
,,
2,18," Aah!
"
,,
2,18," Was that for Party of Five too?
"
,,
2,18,"No, that was for my refund.
"
,,
2,18,"What the hell's Party of Five? 
"
,,
2,18,"By God, I may not be able to give
"
,,
2,18,"my family a vibrating sex doll,
"
,,
2,18," But at least I can give 'em a pool.
"
,,
2,18," Um... I say.
"
,,
2,18,"If you find a human skeleton with a Lincoln
"
,,
2,18,"Log jammed in the temple, I didn't do it.
"
,,
2,18,"But I need that log for my
"
,,
2,18,"recreation of James Madison's cabin.
"
,,
2,18,"OK, kids, I don't want anyone swimmin' in
"
,,
2,18,"this pool unless there's a lifeguard on duty.
"
,,
2,18,"Ha, ha, ha! ""Duty"".
"
,,
2,18,"Ha, ha, ha! ""Diarrhoea""!
"
,,
2,18," Hey, Lois!
"
,,
2,18," What?
"
,,
2,18,"Diarrhoea!
"
,,
2,18,"Peter! I'm holdin' iced tea!
"
,,
2,18,"Oh. Oh. You know, honey,
"
,,
2,18,"you don't have to do this.
"
,,
2,18,"Maybe a pool is another one
"
,,
2,18,"of those things a family doesn't really need.
"
,,
2,18,"Look, everybody. I got us another dog.
"
,,
2,18," What the...?
"
,,
2,18," Hi. You guys have any Cheese Doodles?
"
,,
2,18,"See, that's what I do.
"
,,
2,18,"I ask for a snack and I blow the horn.
"
,,
2,18," Huh, look at this. Some kind of plastic root.
"
,,
2,18," There's no such thing as a plastic root.
"
,,
2,18,"You bastards come into our village
"
,,
2,18,"and kill our fish, pollute our water. 
"
,,
2,18,"I'm gonna send you back
"
,,
2,18,"to hell where you belong. 
"
,,
2,18,"Noooo!
"
,,
2,18," Goodbye. 
"
,,
2,18," Ah, damn it.
"
,,
2,18,"Aw.
"
,,
2,18,"I've fixed the power line, but the town's
"
,,
2,18,"zoning laws prohibit building a pool there.
"
,,
2,18," What? It's my yard.
"
,,
2,18," Sorry, Your house is too close to the kerb.
"
,,
2,18,"Oh, yeah? Well, your eyes
"
,,
2,18,"are too close to your nose.
"
,,
2,18,"That may be. But you know what?
"
,,
2,18,"I only have to wear one goggle
"
,,
2,18,"when I go swimming in my pool!
"
,,
2,18," Hey, wait, wait, wait! Come back here!
"
,,
2,18," What?
"
,,
2,18,"I have to draw you.
"
,,
2,18,"You're why cavemen painted on walls.
"
,,
2,18,"Damn government, telling me
"
,,
2,18,"I can't build a pool on my own land.
"
,,
2,18,"After my grandfather helped create one of
"
,,
2,18,"our most beloved cartoon characters.
"
,,
2,18,"OK. We've narrowed it down to two possible
"
,,
2,18,"names. All in favour of ""Bugs Bunny""?
"
,,
2,18,"And all in favour of
"
,,
2,18,"""Ephraim, the Retarded Rabbit""?
"
,,
2,18,"Oh, you can all go to hell!
"
,,
2,18," Hey, where's the mayor's office?
"
,,
2,18," Last door on the left.
"
,,
2,18," Come on! Come on!
"
,,
2,18," Hello, is this the...
"
,,
2,18,"Oh. Sorry. I thought
"
,,
2,18,"you were the district attorney.
"
,,
2,18,"No, I'm Peter Griffin.
"
,,
2,18,"Oh, you're here about your pool.
"
,,
2,18,"Step into my office.
"
,,
2,18,"I'm here to serve the fine citizens of Quahog.
"
,,
2,18,"It'll be my pleasure to give you a permit.
"
,,
2,18," Well, it's about time.
"
,,
2,18," Well, this is odd.
"
,,
2,18," What?
"
,,
2,18," I've never encountered anything like this,
"
,,
2,18,"but your property doesn't seem
"
,,
2,18,"to be on the map.
"
,,
2,18,"It's not part of Quahog.
"
,,
2,18,"What the hell are you talkin' about?
"
,,
2,18,"I've lived there for 12 years.
"
,,
2,18,"Sorry, but according to this map,
"
,,
2,18,"you're not even part of these United States.
"
,,
2,18,"Which would make you... a communist!
"
,,
2,18," Ah!
"
,,
2,18," Yeah!
"
,,
2,18," Ow!
"
,,
2,18," Damn! Usually my malcontents are skinnier.
"
,,
2,18,"Would you come back in a week, when my
"
,,
2,18,"fat malcontent trap door will be completed?
"
,,
2,18,"I'm not comin' back in a week, or ever!
"
,,
2,18,"I've had it with you
"
,,
2,18,"and this damn government.
"
,,
2,18,"Fine.
"
,,
2,18,"I love this job more than I love taffy.
"
,,
2,18,"And I'm a man who enjoys his taffy.
"
,,
2,18,"Mmm.
"
,,
2,18,"Ooh. Mmm.
"
,,
2,18,"Oh. Hm.
"
,,
2,18,"Hm. Mmm-mm.
"
,,
2,18,"Mm. Oh, oh.
"
,,
2,18,"Mmm.
"
,,
2,18,"What's going on?
"
,,
2,18,"Did the city give you the permit?
"
,,
2,18,"No, no. We're not part of this city.
"
,,
2,18,"We're not even part of this country.
"
,,
2,18," And that makes us our own country.
"
,,
2,18," What are you talking about?
"
,,
2,18,"Thanks to a technicality,
"
,,
2,18,"we have the right to secede from the US.
"
,,
2,18,"From this day forth, this territory
"
,,
2,18,"will be known as ""Petoria""!
"
,,
2,18,"I was going to call it ""Peterland"",
"
,,
2,18,"but that gay bar by the airport took it.
"
,,
2,18,"Our lead story tonight: Petoria.
"
,,
2,18,"A new foreign country which was founded
"
,,
2,18,"this week, here in our own back yard.
"
,,
2,18,"And in a Quahog News 5 Exclusive,
"
,,
2,18,"we sent our own little foreigner,
"
,,
2,18,"Asian correspondent
"
,,
2,18,"Tricia Takanawa, to Petoria,
"
,,
2,18,"where first lady Lois Griffin has graciously
"
,,
2,18,"agreed to give a tour of her country. Tricia.
"
,,
2,18,"Thank you, Diane. So, Mrs Griffin, what's
"
,,
2,18,"it like being the woman behind the man?
"
,,
2,18,"Ah, you know, when Peter first said we were
"
,,
2,18,"our own country, I was a bit sceptical.
"
,,
2,18,"Then I thought ""Hey! I could be like Hillary
"
,,
2,18,"Clinton!"" Only, you know, without the penis.
"
,,
2,18,"Tell us a little bit about your country.
"
,,
2,18,"Well, we're a clean
"
,,
2,18,"and industrious people, mostly white.
"
,,
2,18,"My son Chris is in charge
"
,,
2,18,"of our space programme.
"
,,
2,18,"We hope to get to the moon very shortly.
"
,,
2,18,"Almost!
"
,,
2,18,"Ow! They should really use monkeys for this.
"
,,
2,18,"And little Stewie here is
"
,,
2,18,"our President of Poopy.
"
,,
2,18,"Oh, ha, ha, ha.
"
,,
2,18,"So where is the president now?
"
,,
2,18,"Oh, he's out on
"
,,
2,18,"a goodwill mission to America.
"
,,
2,18,"Here you go, Mr President.
"
,,
2,18,"Mr President!
"
,,
2,18,"Oh, Peter. That tickles me in a way
"
,,
2,18,"that if Loretta tickled me in that way,
"
,,
2,18,"I'd say ""Oh, yeah! That's nice.
"
,,
2,18,"That's the spot.""
"
,,
2,18,"What are you talkin' about? I'm a born leader.
"
,,
2,18,"Like my great-great-uncle Ulysses S Griffin.
"
,,
2,18,"Chug-a-lug! Chug-a-lug!
"
,,
2,18,"Chug-a-lug! Chug-a-lug!
"
,,
2,18," Yeah! Whoo!
"
,,
2,18," How's that, Robert E Lee?
"
,,
2,18,"All right. No more slaves.
"
,,
2,18,"But we still don't have to read books.
"
,,
2,18," Deal.
"
,,
2,18," Yeah!
"
,,
2,18,"Barkeep! Petro-nemo-slappy-wag.
"
,,
2,18,"That's Petorian for
"
,,
2,18,"""More beer, you slappy-wag.""
"
,,
2,18,"You still owe me for the other rounds,
"
,,
2,18,"which comes to 50 bucks.
"
,,
2,18,"I'm a foreign diplomat. I don't pay for drinks.
"
,,
2,18,"You think G Gordon Liddy paid for his drinks
"
,,
2,18,"while he was stranglin' people with
"
,,
2,18,"piano wire for the good of our nation?
"
,,
2,18,"Peter, you can't drink that outside.
"
,,
2,18,"You're gonna end up in jail.
"
,,
2,18,"Not a good jail, like on Cinemax.
"
,,
2,18,"The man-jail.
"
,,
2,18,"Go back and pay the bill, Peter.
"
,,
2,18,"You, uh, don't wanna break the law.
"
,,
2,18,"I can do whatever I want. Watch this.
"
,,
2,18,"Oh, now you're just bein' crazy.
"
,,
2,18,"Hey, that's against the law.
"
,,
2,18,"You're comin' with me.
"
,,
2,18,"Uh-uh-uh! Can't touch me.
"
,,
2,18,"Can't touch me
"
,,
2,18,"Ju-ju-ju-ju-just like the bad guy
"
,,
2,18,"from Lethal Weapon 2
"
,,
2,18,"I've got diplomatic immunity,
"
,,
2,18,"so Hammer, you can't sue
"
,,
2,18,"I can write graffiti, even jaywalk in the street
"
,,
2,18,"I can riot, loot, not give a hoot,
"
,,
2,18,"and touch your sister's teat
"
,,
2,18,"Can't touch me
"
,,
2,18," Can't touch me
"
,,
2,18," What in God's name is he doing?
"
,,
2,18," Can't touch me
"
,,
2,18," I believe that's the ""Worm"".
"
,,
2,18,"Stop! Peter time!
"
,,
2,18,"I'm a big shot, there's no doubt
"
,,
2,18,"Light a fire and pee it out
"
,,
2,18,"Don't like it? Kiss my rump
"
,,
2,18,"Just for a minute let's all do the bump
"
,,
2,18,"Can't touch me
"
,,
2,18,"Yeah, do the Peter Griffin bump
"
,,
2,18,"Can't touch me
"
,,
2,18,"I'm Presidential Peter, interns think I'm hot
"
,,
2,18,"Don't care if you're handicapped,
"
,,
2,18,"I'll still park in your spot
"
,,
2,18,"I've been around the world,
"
,,
2,18,"from Hartford to Bombay
"
,,
2,18,"It's Peter, go Peter, up Peter, yo, Peter,
"
,,
2,18,"let's see Regis rap this way, can't touch me
"
,,
2,18,"Except for you. You can touch me.
"
,,
2,18,"Attention, delegates. This session
"
,,
2,18,"of the United Nations is hereby convened.
"
,,
2,18,"Man, this sucks. Hey, Podium Guy!
"
,,
2,18,"Hey, I got a problem here.
"
,,
2,18," Excuse me. Some of us are here to learn.
"
,,
2,18," No one's talkin' to you, Albania.
"
,,
2,18," Is there a problem back there?
"
,,
2,18," You bet your funny accent there is!
"
,,
2,18,"I'm stuck up here in the nosebleeds.
"
,,
2,18,"I'm president of Petoria. I want a better seat.
"
,,
2,18,"Oh, of course. How could we not have
"
,,
2,18,"recognised the great nation of Petoria?
"
,,
2,18," Have a seat up front.
"
,,
2,18," Well, that's more like it.
"
,,
2,18,"And hey! Would you also
"
,,
2,18,"like a special satellite
"
,,
2,18,"to scratch your ass
"
,,
2,18,"with a laser beam from space?
"
,,
2,18,"They have those?
"
,,
2,18,"Hi. How you doin'? You mind if I, uh...
"
,,
2,18," They don't respect you.
"
,,
2,18," What do you mean?
"
,,
2,18,"I used to be the laughing stock around here
"
,,
2,18,"until my country invaded Kuwait.
"
,,
2,18,"Now I have a seat in the third row.
"
,,
2,18,"The only way to get
"
,,
2,18,"any respect around here
"
,,
2,18,"is to find something you want and just take it.
"
,,
2,18,"Wait. If everybody respects you,
"
,,
2,18,"how come you're eatin' by yourself?
"
,,
2,18," I don't shower.
"
,,
2,18," Oh, that's what that is.
"
,,
2,18,"Take what I want, huh?
"
,,
2,18," Good morning, Joe.
"
,,
2,18," Peter, what are you doin' in my pool?
"
,,
2,18,"Oh, this is the newest province of Petoria.
"
,,
2,18,"I call it ""Johio"".
"
,,
2,18,"What? You can't just come over here
"
,,
2,18,"and annexe my pool.
"
,,
2,18,"Oh, yeah? Well, according to paragraph
"
,,
2,18,"seven, sentence three, word eight
"
,,
2,18,"of the Geneva Convention, ""the"".
"
,,
2,18,"So tough luck, Swanson.
"
,,
2,18," As you can see, Petoria has invaded US soil.
"
,,
2,18," What are our options?
"
,,
2,18,"A military strike against such a small
"
,,
2,18,"nation could cause an international backlash.
"
,,
2,18," But this kind of behaviour can't be tolerated.
"
,,
2,18," Agreed.
"
,,
2,18," I suggest we start with political sanctions.
"
,,
2,18," Good, gentlemen.
"
,,
2,18,"Well, I guess the world'll show me
"
,,
2,18,"a little more respect now.
"
,,
2,18,"Dad, I tried to got to school
"
,,
2,18,"but this guy won't let me.
"
,,
2,18," Oh, yeah? Him and what army?
"
,,
2,18," The US Army.
"
,,
2,18,"Oh, that's a good army.
"
,,
2,18,"The scene outside the US-Petorian border
"
,,
2,18,"as the sun rises on day one
"
,,
2,18,"of Operation Desert Clam. 
"
,,
2,18,"Good morning. I'm Diane Simmons.
"
,,
2,18,"We now go to Tom Tucker,
"
,,
2,18,"live at the site of the US blockade. Tom?
"
,,
2,18,"Diane, I'm here at the Petorian front,
"
,,
2,18,"where the US has cut off electricity,
"
,,
2,18,"water and gas
"
,,
2,18,"to the tiny four-bedroom republic.
"
,,
2,18,"The situation is very tense
"
,,
2,18,"and extremely dangerous.
"
,,
2,18,"It's only a matter of time...
"
,,
2,18,"Oh, my God, they've opened fire. It looks
"
,,
2,18,"like things are getting very heated here.
"
,,
2,18,"This is not a safe place to be.
"
,,
2,18,"And now sports.
"
,,
2,18," Lois?
"
,,
2,18," Over here. I'm chopping carrots for a salad.
"
,,
2,18," Here. Use this head lamp.
"
,,
2,18," Hey, where's the kids?
"
,,
2,18,"Upstairs, doin' their homework
"
,,
2,18,"by candlelight.
"
,,
2,18,"Damn pig-dog Americans,
"
,,
2,18,"messin' with my family like this.
"
,,
2,18,"We can't bathe,
"
,,
2,18,"we can't do laundry, there's no heat...
"
,,
2,18,"We can't live like this for ever.
"
,,
2,18,"It's not for ever.
"
,,
2,18,"You know, it's just... it's just... You know.
"
,,
2,18,"Peter, I'm up here. Oh, sweetie,
"
,,
2,18,"maybe you should go over to Joe's
"
,,
2,18,"and return his pool, huh?
"
,,
2,18,"No. We're a real country. We deserve all
"
,,
2,18,"the rights and privileges everyone else gets.
"
,,
2,18,"But we have to think about
"
,,
2,18,"the welfare of our children.
"
,,
2,18," Stewie, is that you?
"
,,
2,18," Lois, my mind's made up.
"
,,
2,18,"I'm not givin' up an inch of Petorian soil.
"
,,
2,18,"It's not a sign of weakness to compromise.
"
,,
2,18,"I just think you should...
"
,,
2,18,"Peter, stop starin' at my chest.
"
,,
2,18,"Oh. Yeah, sorry, Lois.
"
,,
2,18,"And we're back with our round-table
"
,,
2,18,"discussion on the Petorian crisis.
"
,,
2,18," Uh, you were making a point, John?
"
,,
2,18," Yes.
"
,,
2,18,"What the United States is doing
"
,,
2,18,"to Petoria right now is criminal.
"
,,
2,18,"Nonsense! Force is the only thing
"
,,
2,18,"a despot like Peter Griffin understands.
"
,,
2,18," Fine. Why not just drop a bomb on him?
"
,,
2,18," What about that, Eleanor?
"
,,
2,18,"Oh, it's ridiculous, clearly.
"
,,
2,18,"He's a factory worker, not a despot.
"
,,
2,18,"You're missin' the point. Our blockade is
"
,,
2,18,"turnin' Petoria into a Third World country.
"
,,
2,18,"Can anybody tell me what the square root
"
,,
2,18,"of the hypotenuse is... Chris, is that a note?
"
,,
2,18," No.
"
,,
2,18," Yes, it is.
"
,,
2,18,"Would you like to read it
"
,,
2,18,"for the rest of the class?
"
,,
2,18," No.
"
,,
2,18," Just read it, lardo.
"
,,
2,18," ""I think Mrs Griffin's hot.""
"
,,
2,18," Go to your room.
"
,,
2,18,"Damn you, Rupert! Keep these loathsome
"
,,
2,18,"insects away, or you'll end up like Mr Giraffe.
"
,,
2,18,"Hi. I'm Susan Sarandon.
"
,,
2,18,"A lot of you know me as Tim Robbins'
"
,,
2,18,"mother. But I'm actually his girlfriend.
"
,,
2,18," And this is Stewie.
"
,,
2,18," What the deuce?
"
,,
2,18,"For less that the ticket price
"
,,
2,18,"of one of my movies
"
,,
2,18,"about capital punishment or neo-feminism,
"
,,
2,18,"you can make sure
"
,,
2,18,"that Stewie never goes hungry again.
"
,,
2,18,"Yes, and from the look
"
,,
2,18,"of those sweater cows, so can you.
"
,,
2,18,"Morning, subjects. What's for breakfast?
"
,,
2,18,"Nothing, you idiot. We don't have any food.
"
,,
2,18,"Peter, this has gotten way out of hand.
"
,,
2,18,"Look at what we're reduced to. Our own baby
"
,,
2,18,"has to use newspapers for diapers.
"
,,
2,18,"No, no. No, no, this is fine.
"
,,
2,18,"One second. I'm just about
"
,,
2,18,"finished with Family Circus. 
"
,,
2,18,"There we are. Who did that, Jeffie? Not me.
"
,,
2,18,"My God, I haven't seen everyone this
"
,,
2,18,"miserable since that time we were tortured.
"
,,
2,18,"I'm sorry. Were you just whipping me?
"
,,
2,18,"Or did I just get bit by a mosquito?
"
,,
2,18,"Hey, Lois, if you happen
"
,,
2,18,"to see the dungeon master,
"
,,
2,18,"tell him his grandmother
"
,,
2,18,"was tryin' to work me over.
"
,,
2,18,"It's time to call this whole thing off.
"
,,
2,18,"Nobody's on our side.
"
,,
2,18,"Are you nuts? Look at all these telegrams.
"
,,
2,18,"""Nice goin'. Libya."" ""You the man! North
"
,,
2,18,"Korea."" ""Great job! Iraq.""
"
,,
2,18,"Iraq, Lois! You know what? I'm gonna invite
"
,,
2,18,"a few of these fellas over for a party.
"
,,
2,18,"See, Lois, I told you we had allies.
"
,,
2,18,"Hey, Slobodan. You made it.
"
,,
2,18,"I didn't know what to bring, so I made
"
,,
2,18,"coleslaw. It's made out of people!
"
,,
2,18," Just kidding. Is Muammar here?
"
,,
2,18," Yeah, he's over there with Saddam.
"
,,
2,18,"And then Jerry guessed
"
,,
2,18,"that her name was ""Mulva""!
"
,,
2,18,"That show is so funny.
"
,,
2,18,"It really reminds me of me and my friends,
"
,,
2,18,"how we hang out before I kill them
"
,,
2,18,"for worshipping the wrong god.
"
,,
2,18,"And I love that Kramer guy.
"
,,
2,18,"He comes in the room like this:
"
,,
2,18,"""Whaaaa..."" Well, I can't do it, but you know.
"
,,
2,18," Marco.
"
,,
2,18," Polo!
"
,,
2,18," Marco.
"
,,
2,18," Polo!
"
,,
2,18," Fish out of water!
"
,,
2,18," Aw!
"
,,
2,18,"Yeah, those are lookin' good. Yeah. Manuel!
"
,,
2,18,"Manuel, do you want...
"
,,
2,18,"Can you ask him if he wants cheese?
"
,,
2,18,"Hey! Hey! Fidel! No running around the pool!
"
,,
2,18,"I say, I say, Achmed.
"
,,
2,18,"What is that thing you people do
"
,,
2,18,"when you're about to assassinate an infidel?
"
,,
2,18,"Ah. You mean this?
"
,,
2,18,"Oh, yes, I love that.
"
,,
2,18,"Stewie! This is insanity.
"
,,
2,18," Whoa! Where do you think you're goin'?
"
,,
2,18," America!
"
,,
2,18,"I've had enough. You can keep this filthy
"
,,
2,18,"mess you call a country. Come on, kids.
"
,,
2,18,"This is treason! For God's sake, Peter!
"
,,
2,18,"Make an example of her!
"
,,
2,18,"Nothing says ""Obey me""
"
,,
2,18,"like a bloody head on a fence post.
"
,,
2,18,"Let's go! We're crossin' the border!
"
,,
2,18,"Goodbye, President Griffin.
"
,,
2,18," Brian, at least you're Ioyal enough to stay.
"
,,
2,18," I've stuck by you through worse.
"
,,
2,18,"Ah! Ah! Ah!
"
,,
2,18,"Ah, I guess it's you and me
"
,,
2,18,"against the world, buddy.
"
,,
2,18,"Attention, President Griffin. As you may
"
,,
2,18,"presently, yourself, fully be aware of, 
"
,,
2,18,"my grammar sucks, but more importantly, 
"
,,
2,18,"we're about to commence
"
,,
2,18,"Operation Bomb the Crap
"
,,
2,18,"Out of Your House. 
"
,,
2,18,"The guy who thinks up the names
"
,,
2,18,"is on vacation. Fire! 
"
,,
2,18,"To answer your question, like that.
"
,,
2,18,"The guy who aims is in the john.
"
,,
2,18,"Ah, here he is. Next one's comin' right at you.
"
,,
2,18,"Face it, it's over. Why not sit down with
"
,,
2,18,"the mayor and negotiate some kind of treaty?
"
,,
2,18,"Negotiate? Peter Griffin doesn't know
"
,,
2,18,"the meaning of the word ""negotiate"".
"
,,
2,18,"Can... can I tie you to a stick
"
,,
2,18,"and use you as a white flag?
"
,,
2,18,"Thank you all for coming.
"
,,
2,18,"We invited Jesse Jackson
"
,,
2,18,"to open our negotiations with a prayer.
"
,,
2,18,"Ooh!
"
,,
2,18,"Unfortunately, he couldn't make it,
"
,,
2,18,"so in his place we have LaToya Jackson.
"
,,
2,18,"Thanks. Um... Rub-a-dub-dub,
"
,,
2,18,"thanks for the grub. Yeah, God!
"
,,
2,18,"How very inappropriate. Thank you.
"
,,
2,18,"Now, Mr Griffin, would you like to begin?
"
,,
2,18,"OK. After much thought and consideration,
"
,,
2,18,"I have decided to make a concession or two.
"
,,
2,18," Very good, Peter.
"
,,
2,18," First, I will return Joe's pool.
"
,,
2,18," Oh, you got that right!
"
,,
2,18," But I demand access to it on weekends.
"
,,
2,18," No.
"
,,
2,18," Accepted.
"
,,
2,18,"I also demand to remain my own,
"
,,
2,18,"independent nation.
"
,,
2,18," Absolutely not.
"
,,
2,18," How about you give me your pen?
"
,,
2,18,"You mean this cheap little pen
"
,,
2,18,"we have millions of back at the office?
"
,,
2,18," Yeah.
"
,,
2,18," No.
"
,,
2,18,"Oh, man. So after all this
"
,,
2,18,"I end up with nothin'?
"
,,
2,18,"How about this?
"
,,
2,18,"Every night when you get home from work,
"
,,
2,18,"I'll scratch your back
"
,,
2,18,"with a matchbook cover like you like.
"
,,
2,18," Ah, Lois.
"
,,
2,18," Aw.
"
,,
2,18," Will you call me ""Big Rudy"" when you do?
"
,,
2,18," No.
"
,,
2,18,"And that's the story of Petoria,
"
,,
2,18,"a little nation that, 200 years ago,
"
,,
2,18,"seceded and repatriated
"
,,
2,18,"in less than a week.
"
,,
2,18," Any questions?
"
,,
2,18," Yeah, uh, I don't get it.
"
,,
2,18,"So, like, can the family understand the baby,
"
,,
2,18,"or... or... What's the deal with that?

"

2,19,"Why don't you come back in about 17 years?
"
,,
2,19,"But the shelf life of that Sodium Pentothal

"
,,
2,19,"Well, let's take a look at your transcript.
"
,,
2,19,"""Meg."" Hm.
"
,,
2,19,"That's not very impressive.
"
,,
2,19,"It's just three letters. It's hardly a name at all.
"
,,
2,19,"I never wanted to call her Meg.
"
,,
2,19,"I wanted to call her Twiki. But Lois
"
,,
2,19,"said kids now wouldn't get the reference.
"
,,
2,19,"You know what I'm talking about?
"
,,
2,19,"Bidibidibidi.
"
,,
2,19,"I'm not sure you're Brown material.
"
,,
2,19,"Don't you have any extracurricular activities?
"
,,
2,19,"Well, I'm president of the Luke Perry
"
,,
2,19,"fan club, Quahog chapter.
"
,,
2,19,"But I've wanted to go to Brown
"
,,
2,19,"ever since I was a little girl.
"
,,
2,19,"Well, actually, I really wanted
"
,,
2,19,"to go to Wellesley
"
,,
2,19,"but Mom said I might as well buy hiking
"
,,
2,19,"boots and call myself a lesbian right now.
"
,,
2,19,"Meg! Eat your salad.
"
,,
2,19," We're not having dinner.
"
,,
2,19," Then be quiet.
"
,,
2,19,"I have no future! I'm just gonna
"
,,
2,19,"wait in my room until I'm dead.
"
,,
2,19," I'll be in shortly.
"
,,
2,19," We've gotta do something.
"
,,
2,19,"If Meg doesn't get into college,
"
,,
2,19,"who knows what future she'll have?
"
,,
2,19," You ain't getting this meat. This is my meat.
"
,,
2,19," Shut up. I found this meat.
"
,,
2,19,"I'm never gonna get into college.
"
,,
2,19,"You just need more extracurricular activities.
"
,,
2,19," You could get a part-time job.
"
,,
2,19," I had one when I was in high school.
"
,,
2,19," Oh! Argh!
"
,,
2,19," Argh!
"
,,
2,19,"That'll be $27.50.
"
,,
2,19,"Come on. There's gotta be
"
,,
2,19,"a hundred clubs at your school.
"
,,
2,19,"Uh, well, I do have a friend
"
,,
2,19,"on the school newspaper.
"
,,
2,19,"Attagirl. And I got your first story right here.
"
,,
2,19,"Lois, I challenge you
"
,,
2,19,"to a race around the world.
"
,,
2,19,"Go!
"
,,
2,19,"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
"
,,
2,19,"We need a picture for the front page.
"
,,
2,19,"Hold on. I gotta rinse my retainer.
"
,,
2,19,"I'm looking for something
"
,,
2,19,"like the spread in last month's Vanity Fair.
"
,,
2,19,"That was so sweet.
"
,,
2,19,"It was wicked, awesome.
"
,,
2,19,"Stop the presses! It's Meg!
"
,,
2,19,"I'm just joshing. It's all done
"
,,
2,19,"on Xerox. What can I do you?
"
,,
2,19,"Look, Neil, I need an activity to get
"
,,
2,19,"into Brown. The paper is my last hope.
"
,,
2,19," Can I be a reporter?
"
,,
2,19," I don't know, Meg.
"
,,
2,19,"You never seem to be that interested in
"
,,
2,19,"journalism-or journalists, such as myself.
"
,,
2,19,"You know, I never realised how smooth
"
,,
2,19,"the skin between your acne is.
"
,,
2,19,"OK, I'll give you a shot. I've never been
"
,,
2,19,"able to get an interview with the mayor.
"
,,
2,19," You get it and I'll make you a reporter.
"
,,
2,19," You got it.
"
,,
2,19,"Run, little rabbit, run.
"
,,
2,19,"But some day our two worlds will be one.
"
,,
2,19,"I hope my face clears up by then.
"
,,
2,19," Excuse me, Mayor?
"
,,
2,19," How do you know my language?
"
,,
2,19,"Listen to me.
"
,,
2,19,"My entire future is in your hands.
"
,,
2,19," Are you Sarah Connor?
"
,,
2,19," No, I'm Meg Griffin. I need to interview you.
"
,,
2,19," You're with the press?
"
,,
2,19," Yes.
"
,,
2,19,"Well, you can't interview
"
,,
2,19,"a dead man... can you?
"
,,
2,19," What about my interview?
"
,,
2,19," Mayor West asked me to give you this.
"
,,
2,19,"Uh-oh.
"
,,
2,19,"Of course, you realise this means war.
"
,,
2,19,"No.
"
,,
2,19,"No, that's what they'll be expecting.
"
,,
2,19,"Mayor West?
"
,,
2,19,"Well, well, Mr Toilet.
"
,,
2,19,"I thought you were in the Hamptons.
"
,,
2,19,"No. No, no, it's me, Meg Griffin.
"
,,
2,19,"I don't talk to the press
"
,,
2,19,"under any circumstances.
"
,,
2,19," What makes you think I'll talk now?
"
,,
2,19," This.
"
,,
2,19,"You just don't give up, do you?
"
,,
2,19,"You seize life by the throat and shake it

2,19,"You've got your interview.
"
,,
2,19," Thanks!
"
,,
2,19," Hey! Hey! Listen to this.
"
,,
2,19,"Do I sound like
"
,,
2,19,"I'm on old-time radio?
"
,,
2,19,"Mm! Oh!
"
,,
2,19,"No more treats.
"

2,19,"You're gonna spoil your dinner.
"
,,
2,19,"Oh, come on!
"
,,
2,19,"Oh, damn my small stature.
"
,,
2,19,"If I were big, oh, just think where I would be.
"
,,
2,19,"Tired of not being able to find
"
,,
2,19,"clothes that fit? I know I was.
"
,,
2,19,"That's why I started Stewie's Big and
"

2,19,"Tall Man Shop. If you're portly or tall,
"
,,
2,19,"you'll find a friendly atmosphere brimming
"

2,19,"with personalised and expert service.
"
,,
2,19," Hey, Stewie, how's the weather up there?
"
,,
2,19," Very fair... like our prices.
"
,,
2,19,"Hey, dude. You want some of these?
"
,,
2,19,"I say, here's the solution to my troubles.
"
,,
2,19,"If I could build a device to harness
"
,,
2,19,"the size of that leviathan,
"

2,19,"there's no limit to what I could...

2,19,"Oh, my God, there's an orgy in my mouth.
"
,,
2,19,"""Got milk?"" That's a funny one too.
"
,,
2,19,"Oh, and, uh ""I got ya, diagonally"".
"
,,
2,19,"""Pretty sneaky, sis."" That one's also funny.
"
,,
2,19,"Mayor West, you've been talking for an hour
"
,,
2,19,"and I don't have anything I can use.
"
,,
2,19," Can't you just please...
"
,,
2,19," My God! Somebody's stealing my water.
"
,,
2,19,"It just went down the drain.
"
,,
2,19,"They're crafty, I tell you.
"
,,
2,19,"It happens when you least expect it.
"
,,
2,19,"Show yourself, damn you!
"
,,
2,19,"I've been investigating him for months.
"
,,
2,19,"It's cost $150,000 of the taxpayers' money
"
,,
2,19,"but I'll find the culprits
"
,,
2,19,"if it costs me a million.
"
,,
2,19,"You spent public money investigating this? 
"
,,
2,19,"Thanks. You know, I think I have my story.
"
,,
2,19,"Your story? Wait a minute!
"
,,
2,19,"You can't print that!
"
,,
2,19,"It'll compromise my entire investigation!
"
,,
2,19,"Well, thank God she's just
"
,,
2,19,"a figment of my imagination.
"
,,
2,19,"Well, let's take the old boy
"
,,
2,19,"out for a spin. Eyes open!
"

2,19,"Voice test: I'm Chris.
"

2,19," I'm Chris.

2,19,"Eviscerate the proletariat!
"

2,19,"Puttin' on the Ritz!
"
,,
2,19,"Not my bit, but still funny. System off.
"
,,
2,19,"Splendid.
"
,,
2,19," I did it! I got a great story.
"
,,
2,19," So, what did your editor say?
"
,,
2,19,"He was gone for the day
"
,,
2,19,"so I left it on his desk.
"
,,
2,19,"But here, I brought you a copy.
"
,,
2,19,"Oh, my God. ""Corruption
"
,,
2,19,"in City Hall."" This is amazing.
"
,,
2,19,"Hey, let me see that.
"
,,
2,19,"This'll never get Meg
"
,,
2,19,"on the paper. This is old news.
"
,,
2,19,"There have been political scandals
"
,,
2,19,"since Thomas Jefferson.
"
,,
2,19,"Oh, hold on. Honey,
"
,,
2,19,"let's get all the kids in this.
"
,,
2,19,"I know kids, and this story's
"
,,
2,19,"gonna put 'em to sleep.
"
,,
2,19,"Meg needs something that'll pull those kids
"
,,
2,19,"away from their Rock 'Em Sock 'Em robots
"
,,
2,19,"and their Spirographs and
"
,,
2,19,"their Moby Grape and their 90210.
"
,,
2,19,"Luke Perry. That's it! Brian, I got my story.
"
,,
2,19,"Now, to get this story on the school editor's
"
,,
2,19,"desk is gonna take a portion of my cunning.
"
,,
2,19,"No! No.
"

2,19,"All my cunning.

2,19," Oh, thanks!
"
,,
2,19,"Way to go, Meg!
"
,,
2,19,"Congratulations, Meg. This is the most
"
,,
2,19,"sensational story we've ever had.
"
,,
2,19,"Argh!
"
,,
2,19," Luke! Time for dinner!
"
,,
2,19," In a minute, babe.
"
,,
2,19,"I'm just reading every high-school newspaper
"
,,
2,19,"in America to see if I'm mentioned.
"
,,
2,19,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
2,19,"Meg Griffin, you are so sued.
"
,,
2,19,"Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duuh!
"
,,
2,19,"Duddle-duddle-duddle-duddle-duddle-duh!
"
,,
2,19," Luke Perry is suing us?
"
,,
2,19," Dad, how could you do this to me?
"
,,
2,19," I love Luke Perry.
"
,,
2,19," Meg, you're wasting your time.
"
,,
2,19," Don't you read the papers? He's gay.
"
,,
2,19," You can't just print lies.
"
,,
2,19," He has a wife and son.
"
,,
2,19," So what?
"
,,
2,19,"A lot of these famous types lead secret lives
"
,,
2,19,"we don't know about. Like Ricky Martin.
"
,,
2,19,"Ricky, we love you! We love you!
"
,,
2,19," One minute to curtain, Jewel.
"
,,
2,19," Jewel! Jewel!
"
,,
2,19,"I just wanted you to have something
"
,,
2,19,"to put on your transcript.
"
,,
2,19,"Thanks to you I can put that I'm a big liar
"
,,
2,19,"who makes up stories about people.
"
,,
2,19,"It worked for Walter Cronkite... You know
"
,,
2,19,"that Vietnam thing? Never happened.
"
,,
2,19,"Don't mention it at the veterans' hospital.
"
,,
2,19,"Those guys are committed to the lie.
"
,,
2,19,"Aw, don't cry, sweetheart.
"
,,
2,19,"I'll make it up to you.
"
,,
2,19,"Remember the pony you wanted
"
,,
2,19,"when you were six?
"
,,
2,19,"Well, I bought him and I've been saving him
"
,,
2,19,"for a time like this. Surprise!
"
,,
2,19,"Oh. Oh, God. That's right. Ponies...
"
,,
2,19,"Ponies like food, don't they? Oh, boy.
"
,,
2,19,"Poor Meg. I know it sounds crazy but I can't
"
,,
2,19,"help feeling like this is somehow my fault.
"
,,
2,19,"No, it's Luke Perry's fault.
"
,,
2,19,"If he were gay Meg would be all set.
"
,,
2,19,"Brian, that's it! If I could get a picture
"
,,
2,19,"of Luke Perry doing something gaylike
"
,,
2,19,"it'll make people believe Meg's story is true!
"
,,
2,19," Yeeh!
"
,,
2,19," How the hell are you gonna do that?
"
,,
2,19,"Hey, I've gotten people
"
,,
2,19,"to believe crazier things.
"
,,
2,19,"""And if you are pure of heart and deed you'll

2,19,"all go to a beautiful place called Heaven.""
"

"
,,
2,19,"All right, now walk up to the counter.
"
,,
2,19,"That's it. Ring the bell.
"
,,
2,19," Well, hi there.
"
,,
2,19," Good day, shopkeep.
"
,,
2,19,"Good day, shopkeep.
"
,,
2,19,"I require a hand-operated buzz saw capable
"

2,19,"of cutting through a human sternum.
"
,,
2,19," What?
"
,,
2,19," It's for a school project.
"
,,
2,19,"I'm some sort of student sent here for...

2,19,"Uh, sorry, kid. I can't

2,19,"sell power tools to minors.
"
,,
2,19,"Look here, you gourd-bellied codpiece. Allow
"
,,
2,19,"me to purchase the provisions I demand
"
,,
2,19,"or I shall transform your blue collar
"
,,
2,19,"into a red one and...
"
,,
2,19,"Who the deuce are you?
"
,,
2,19,"No, I don't have any spare change.
"
,,
2,19,"Where the hell would I keep it?
"
,,
2,19,"In my diaper? Get outta here, you hobo!
"
,,
2,19,"Oh, bloody hell. Is this thing still on?
"
,,
2,19,"All right, now, we gotta be very crafty
"
,,
2,19,"so Luke Perry doesn't recognise us.
"
,,
2,19,"Argh!
"
,,
2,19,"How is he gonna recognise us?
"
,,
2,19,"He doesn't know who we are.
"
,,
2,19,"Oh. Huh. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, you're right.
"
,,
2,19,"Oh!
"
,,
2,19," Sir, you look familiar.
"
,,
2,19," Yeah, I'm that guy you wish you were.
"
,,
2,19,"OK, as soon as I seduce him
"
,,
2,19,"get ready to snap the picture.
"
,,
2,19,"You're really gonna try
"
,,
2,19,"and seduce Luke Perry?
"
,,
2,19,"Listen, Brian, I'd take a bullet for Meg
"
,,
2,19,"so I'm sure I can take a... Here he is.
"
,,
2,19," Thirsty?
"
,,
2,19," No.
"
,,
2,19,"Gee, the sun seems really strong,
"
,,
2,19,"even for my already-bronzed skin.
"
,,
2,19,"Oh, my muscles are all...
"
,,
2,19,"Look, they're all shiny with oil.
"
,,
2,19,"But how am I ever gonna spread it
"
,,
2,19,"on my rippling back and thighs?
"
,,
2,19,"Ah, this is gonna take drastic measures.
"
,,
2,19,"All right, get the camera ready. Oh, Luke!
"
,,
2,19,"Mission accomplished, Peter.
"
,,
2,19," We have a picture of Luke Perry vomiting.
"
,,
2,19," That's no good.
"
,,
2,19,"Gays don't vomit.
"
,,
2,19,"They're a very clean people.
"
,,
2,19,"They have been ever since
"
,,
2,19,"they first came here from France.
"
,,
2,19," Hi, honey. How was school?
"
,,
2,19," Just great.
"
,,
2,19,"I can't even say my name without
"
,,
2,19,"people asking me if I made it up.
"
,,
2,19," How could Dad do this to me?
"
,,
2,19," Aw, honey, he wasn't doing it to you.
"
,,
2,19,"He was doing it for you. He knows
"
,,
2,19,"how much you want to go to Brown.
"
,,
2,19,"There's no way I'm gonna
"
,,
2,19,"get in now. I'm a felon.
"
,,
2,19,"Now, that's not true. Libel's not a felony.
"
,,
2,19,"It's a civil matter. Don't worry.
"
,,
2,19,"Your father will straighten everything out.
"
,,
2,19,"Come on. Let's go get our nails done.

"
,,
2,19," Uh, I don't think so, pal.
"
,,
2,19," Oh, my God, I know you!
"
,,
2,19,"You're Luke Perry!
"
,,
2,19,"You were great in Rain Man. 
"
,,
2,19,"That scene where you wanted to get on
"
,,
2,19,"the plane and that dumb guy was screaming.
"
,,
2,19," Uh, that was Tom Cruise.
"
,,
2,19," Not in this movie theatre it wasn't.
"
,,
2,19,"Every time I see that lame-o actor
"
,,
2,19,"I put your head on his body.
"
,,
2,19,"Thanks. It's nice to meet someone
"
,,
2,19,"who appreciates my work.
"
,,
2,19,"Come to my house so I can take
"
,,
2,19,"a picture of you in a gay pose.
"
,,
2,19,"Huh?
"

2,19," Dinner?
"
,,
2,19," Sure.

2,19,"but I thought she was just being a bitch.
"
,,
2,19,"Listen, I gotta get going.
"
,,
2,19,"Oh, God! I'm sorry. You know
"
,,
2,19,"what's good for getting wine out?
"
,,
2,19," Sex with another man.
"
,,
2,19," Whoa! Look, if you're gay, that's cool.
"
,,
2,19,"But I am not. And even if I was...
"
,,
2,19,"Come on, I'm Luke Perry.
"
,,
2,19,"I can get a much better gay guy than you.
"
,,
2,19,"Oh, my God! Luke Perry!
"
,,
2,19,"See, Meg? I told you your father
"
,,
2,19,"would explain about the article.
"
,,
2,19,"Meg? Meg Griffin?
"
,,
2,19," Uh, Peter, I think it's time for plan B.
"
,,
2,19," Way ahead of you, Brian.
"
,,
2,19,"Don't worry, I packed my own backup chute.
"
,,
2,19,"Aw, crap.
"
,,
2,19,"I should've figured
"
,,
2,19,"you were up to something.
"
,,
2,19,"This is all my fault. I was just trying to help
"
,,
2,19,"my daughter get onto the school newspaper.
"
,,
2,19,"You know what it's like to be a teenager.
"
,,
2,19," You've been playing one for 30 years.
"
,,
2,19," Won't you drop the lawsuit, please, Dylan?
"
,,
2,19,"Ah, what the hell. But, hey,
"
,,
2,19,"you gotta print the real story.
"
,,
2,19,"And this time I wanna talk to the real reporter.
"
,,
2,19," Let's go, Meg.
"
,,
2,19," See, Meg?
"
,,
2,19,"Things work out if you do whatever you want
"
,,
2,19,"without worrying about the consequences.
"
,,
2,19,"Thanks, Daddy. Come on, Luke.
"
,,
2,19,"I got my computer in my room.
"
,,
2,19,"Meg, keep your door open.
"
,,
2,19,"I wanted to give you a copy
"
,,
2,19,"of my daughter's article.
"
,,
2,19," Listen, thanks for the...
"
,,
2,19," Uh, Peter, I'm kind of busy.
"
,,
2,19,"Oh! Uh, yeah. That's OK. Well, uh, thank...
"
,,
2,19,"So, where were we?
"

2,20,"C'mon, Death. You can do this.
"
,,
2,20,"Why do you care so much
"
,,
2,20,"about touring a stupid brewery?
"
,,
2,20,"Everyone has their sanctuary.
"
,,
2,20,"The Catholics have churches,
"
,,
2,20,"fat people have Wisconsin,
"
,,
2,20,"and I have the Pawtucket Brewery.
"
,,
2,20,"Now help me drink these beers.
"
,,
2,20," Peter, I'm not drinkin' this.
"
,,
2,20," OK, OK. All right, all right.
"
,,
2,20,"Lois, uh, I'm gonna go to the store now, OK?
"
,,
2,20,"Here I go. Duh-duh-nuh-duh-duh-duh-nuh...
"
,,
2,20,"Stop it! What if the kids
"
,,
2,20,"were to see you drinkin' like this?
"
,,
2,20,"Especially Stewie. He's so impressionable.
"
,,
2,20,"Oh, my God! Please tell me we didn't do it.
"
,,
2,20,"Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
"
,,
2,20,"Huh. Nothin'.
"
,,
2,20," Peter, it's seven in the mornin'.
"
,,
2,20," Thanks for the update, Big Ben.
"
,,
2,20," You're drunk again!
"
,,
2,20," No, exhausted. I've been drinkin' all night.
"
,,
2,20,"Peter, if you keep this up,
"
,,
2,20,"somethin' terrible's gonna happen.
"
,,
2,20,"Yeah, somethin' terrible...
"
,,
2,20,"all the way to the bank!
"
,,
2,20," Nice.
"
,,
2,20," Oh, I don't have time for this.
"
,,
2,20,"I'm late for my checkup.
"
,,
2,20,"Wheeee! Whoo-hoo!
"
,,
2,20,"Yeah! All right!
"
,,
2,20," What's goin' on?
"
,,
2,20," It seems Joe has found the first scroll.
"
,,
2,20,"He's tastin' victory. I bet it tastes good.
"
,,
2,20,"Like saltwater taffy or a Chunky.
"
,,
2,20,"Oh, no! If there's four tickets
"
,,
2,20,"and one of 'em's gone, that... that leaves...
"
,,
2,20,"this many!
"
,,
2,20,"Good morning, Mrs Griffin.
"
,,
2,20,"Hello! Hello! Hello!
"
,,
2,20,"Hello! Ha, ha! Just kidding.
"
,,
2,20," So, uh, any problems?
"
,,
2,20," No, everything's fine, Doctor.
"
,,
2,20," Lois?
"
,,
2,20," Oh. Hello, Alexis.
"
,,
2,20,"Heard you might not enter
"
,,
2,20,"the competition this year. Smart move.
"
,,
2,20,"Yes, well, there are more important things
"
,,
2,20,"in life than a piano competition.
"
,,
2,20,"Oh, yes. Especially for those who
"
,,
2,20,"have no-oh, that's cold! - Chance.
"
,,
2,20,"For your information,
"
,,
2,20,"I have a student that could whip you.
"
,,
2,20,"Well, I guess I'll see you there.
"
,,
2,20,"Fred, this is not a date!
"
,,
2,20," All right, you're all done, Alexis.
"
,,
2,20," What do you know?
"
,,
2,20,"Once again, I finish first.
"
,,
2,20,"Don't let her get to you. She asked for
"
,,
2,20,"""Pine Forest"". I gave her ""New Car"".
"
,,
2,20,"Did you hear? It's over!
"
,,
2,20,"Somebody found the last scroll!
"
,,
2,20," Oh, my God! No!
"
,,
2,20," It's true. The final scroll has been recovered.
"
,,
2,20,"The recipient declines
"
,,
2,20,"to be interviewed for safety reasons,
"
,,
2,20,"but I'm sure you're all with me when
"
,,
2,20,"I say ""Congratulations, you son of a bitch.""
"
,,
2,20,"Oh, what am I gonna do now?
"
,,
2,20," Hello, dumb-dumb.
"
,,
2,20," Not now, Gazoo. I wanna be alone.
"
,,
2,20,"It's not always about you, fatso.
"
,,
2,20,"Maybe I wanted to talk.
"
,,
2,20,"I guess wantin' it more than anyone
"
,,
2,20,"just wasn't enough.
"
,,
2,20,"Hey, you guys! It's a fake!
"
,,
2,20,"There's still a scroll out there!
"
,,
2,20,"That's right. I made it up. I figured if
"
,,
2,20,"people thought the last scroll was found,
"
,,
2,20,"everyone would stop looking,
"
,,
2,20,"giving me the edge to find it myself.
"
,,
2,20,"But what I did was wrong.
"
,,
2,20,"And as an act of contrition,
"
,,
2,20,"I will now insert this
"
,,
2,20,"carnivorous earwig into my brain.
"
,,
2,20,"Huh. Kinda tickles.
"
,,
2,20,"Aaah!
"
,,
2,20,"Oh God! It's eating out
"
,,
2,20,"the back of my eyes! Aah!
"
,,
2,20,"In other news, chocolate may be better for you
"
,,
2,20,"than once thought. In a recent 12-day study...
"
,,
2,20,"Ah, my last beer. Here goes.
"
,,
2,20,"I bet that scroll makes the beer taste terrible.
"
,,
2,20,"Oh, God.
"
,,
2,20,"What the hell...?
"
,,
2,20,"I've found it! I've found the last scroll!
"
,,
2,20," He found it!
"
,,
2,20," Oh, my God!
"
,,
2,20,"Run home, Peter! Run as fast as you can!
"
,,
2,20,"Aah!
"
,,
2,20,"Aah!
"
,,
2,20,"Aah!
"
,,
2,20,"Aah!
"
,,
2,20,"Aah!
"
,,
2,20,"Aah!
"
,,
2,20,"Aah!
"
,,
2,20,"Aah!
"
,,
2,20,"Oh, man, this is the happiest day of my life.
"
,,
2,20,"Now I know how Barbra Streisand felt
"
,,
2,20,"the day she married James Brolin.
"
,,
2,20," I love you.
"
,,
2,20," I love you too.
"
,,
2,20,"Oh! I'm so glad I married
"
,,
2,20,"a regular person and not a celebrity.
"
,,
2,20,"Professional ninja Jerry Nelson,
"
,,
2,20,"how did you find your silver scroll?
"
,,
2,20,"I was at home nursing this throwing-star
"
,,
2,20,"wound, my wife Janey gives me a beer,
"
,,
2,20,"and bam, there it was.
"
,,
2,20,"Honey, I'm sorry. You know
"
,,
2,20,"you can't sneak up on me.
"
,,
2,20,"Ladies and gentlemen,
"
,,
2,20,"in his first public appearance ever,
"
,,
2,20,"Pawtucket Pat!
"
,,
2,20,"That's for my brother Luis! He drank
"
,,
2,20,"himself to death on your crappy beer!
"
,,
2,20,"Gotcha!
"
,,
2,20,"A big hand for Cheech Marin, everybody.
"
,,
2,20,"Let the tour begin.
"
,,
2,20," Hey, look!
"
,,
2,20," Oh, those are the Chumbawambas.
"
,,
2,20," They live here with me.
"
,,
2,20," Hey, Pat. Where's the wheelchair ramp?
"
,,
2,20,"Oh, we don't have one.
"
,,
2,20,"I guess this is where you get off.
"
,,
2,20,"Chumbawamba, gobbledy-goo
"
,,
2,20,"Life isn't fair, it's sad but it's true
"
,,
2,20,"Chumbawamba, gobbledy-gee
"
,,
2,20,"When your poor legs are stiff as a tree
"
,,
2,20,"What do you do
"
,,
2,20,"when you're stuck in a chair
"
,,
2,20,"Finding it hard to go up and down stairs?
"
,,
2,20,"What do you think of the one you call God
"
,,
2,20,"Isn't his absence slightly odd?
"
,,
2,20,"Maybe he's forgotten you
"
,,
2,20,"Chumbawamba, gobbledy-gorse
"
,,
2,20,"Count yourself lucky you're not a horse
"
,,
2,20,"They would turn you into dog food
"
,,
2,20,"Or to Chumbawamba gobbledy-glue!
"
,,
2,20,"I'm glad I'm not takin' your stupid tour!
"
,,
2,20,"I'm a Coors man anyway! Silver Bullet!
"
,,
2,20,"Gobbledy-glue!
"
,,
2,20,"Very good, Jimmy.
"
,,
2,20," Trying to watch the History Channel.
"
,,
2,20," Try it again.
"
,,
2,20,"Uh. Not talking to myself.
"
,,
2,20,"You're good enough
"
,,
2,20,"to tackle a Beethoven sonata!
"
,,
2,20,"Let me grab the sheet music. Keep playing!
"
,,
2,20,"I got the mu... Oh, my God!
"
,,
2,20," Jimmy, what happened?
"
,,
2,20," Yes, Jimmy. What happened?
"
,,
2,20,"I... I fell.
"
,,
2,20,"It's all behind this door.
"
,,
2,20,"Lady and gentlemen, the beer room!
"
,,
2,20,"Take a drink and you'll sink
"
,,
2,20,"To a state of pure inebriation
"
,,
2,20,"You'll be tanked
"
,,
2,20,"Like the whole Irish nation
"
,,
2,20,"Yeah!
"
,,
2,20,"When you drink enough of my beer
"
,,
2,20,"You will find this magic rule
"
,,
2,20,"Make your every joke a jewel
"
,,
2,20,"You'll drive drunker than Oksana Baiul
"
,,
2,20,"Go on, buds, drink my suds
"
,,
2,20,"Till you've reached that pure inebriation
"
,,
2,20,"Though the beer may be free
"
,,
2,20,"You're just renting it from me
"
,,
2,20,"Ah. It's like I died and went to heaven.
"
,,
2,20,"But then they realised it wasn't my time,
"
,,
2,20,"and so they sent me back to a brewery.
"
,,
2,20,"We're still working some of the bugs
"
,,
2,20,"out of our latest invention, Permasuds.
"
,,
2,20,"Beer that never goes flat. No matter
"
,,
2,20,"how old it gets, it stays carbonated.
"
,,
2,20,"Ooh! Aah!
"
,,
2,20," Brian, wait.
"
,,
2,20," Maybe we should stick with the group.
"
,,
2,20,"Beer that never goes flat!
"
,,
2,20,"Do you know what that means, Brian?
"
,,
2,20,"This beer will still be carbonated
"
,,
2,20,"long after you die of old age
"
,,
2,20,"and we buy another dog
"
,,
2,20,"to help the kids, you know, forget about you.
"
,,
2,20," Peter, I wouldn't...
"
,,
2,20," Wow! That's incredible.
"
,,
2,20,"Ah, what the hell. Cheers!
"
,,
2,20,"I don't know why he said it wasn't ready.
"
,,
2,20," It tastes pretty good to me... Whoa!
"
,,
2,20," Oh, my God! What the hell's happening?
"
,,
2,20,"Must be the beer. Hey! Hey, check this out.
"
,,
2,20,"And look at this!
"
,,
2,20,"Oh, yeah? Watch this!
"
,,
2,20," Oh, my God!
"
,,
2,20," Relax, Brian, it's just a trick.
"
,,
2,20," See, look, my thumb is fine.
"
,,
2,20," I'm talking about that!
"
,,
2,20,"Holy crap! There's nothing to grab onto!
"
,,
2,20," Oh, this is it, pal. We're goners.
"
,,
2,20," Peter, I've really cherished our friendship.
"
,,
2,20,"Me too, buddy. That's why I was holdin'
"
,,
2,20,"this in, but, if we're gonna die anyway...
"
,,
2,20,"Peter, that's it!
"
,,
2,20," Hey! Hey, pull my finger.
"
,,
2,20," My pleasure.
"
,,
2,20,"Hey, Peter, this next one
"
,,
2,20,"you can blame on the dog.
"
,,
2,20,"Ah! Silent but life-saving.
"
,,
2,20,"What the hell is this?
"
,,
2,20,"Didn't you see that sign?
"
,,
2,20,"You've sullied my factory
"
,,
2,20,"and disobeyed my rules.
"
,,
2,20," I want you to leave immediately!
"
,,
2,20," Oh, come on!
"
,,
2,20," Don't I at least get a Chumbawamba song?
"
,,
2,20," Oh, fine.
"
,,
2,20,"Chumbawamba, gobble...
"
,,
2,20,"Aah!
"
,,
2,20,"Aah!
"
,,
2,20,"Aah!
"
,,
2,20,"Come on, Meg. The competition is this
"
,,
2,20,"Sunday, and you're not even close to ready.
"
,,
2,20," Maybe if you loosened my chains?
"
,,
2,20," We tried that, remember, honey?
"
,,
2,20," You can't be trusted.
"
,,
2,20," Lois, take a letter.
"
,,
2,20,"""Dear Pawtucket Pat, I hate you!
"
,,
2,20,"You are a bad man!""
"
,,
2,20,"""And you made me cry. Furthermore...""
"
,,
2,20,"Not now, Peter.
"
,,
2,20,"Meg and I are havin' a little girl time,
"
,,
2,20," Help me!
"
,,
2,20," Go on. No boys allowed.
"
,,
2,20,"Jeez, Lois. Still with the piano? What's a guy
"
,,
2,20,"gotta do to get a little attention around here?
"
,,
2,20,"Peter, that's incredible!
"
,,
2,20,"I don't understand how...
"
,,
2,20,"You're like the idiot from Shine!
"
,,
2,20,"Meg, you're free. Try the clarinet.
"
,,
2,20,"Keep playin'. Keep playin'!
"
,,
2,20,"No, no, no. Play it like you did last night.
"
,,
2,20," I... I can't!
"
,,
2,20," Peter, talent doesn't disappear just like that.
"
,,
2,20,"Well, sometimes it does. I mean,
"
,,
2,20,"you were pretty bad in bed Saturday night.
"
,,
2,20,"Come on, Lois, move or somethin'!
"
,,
2,20,"Jeez, it's like doin' it with a pillow.
"
,,
2,20," Peter, I stayed at my mother's that night.
"
,,
2,20," Oh.
"
,,
2,20,"Oh, jeez, this hangover's killin' me. I haven't
"
,,
2,20,"felt this crappy since I went to that museum.
"
,,
2,20,"Why did all the dinosaurs die out?
"
,,
2,20,"Because you touch yourself at night.
"
,,
2,20,"Here, this'll make you feel better.
"
,,
2,20,"Huh. I think we've found his muse.
"
,,
2,20,"Oh, my God. You can only
"
,,
2,20,"play the piano when you're drunk!
"
,,
2,20,"That's not true. I can also vomit, fall down
"
,,
2,20,"and make dirty calls
"
,,
2,20,"to your sister when I'm drunk.
"
,,
2,20,"Get a case of beer.
"
,,
2,20,"We've got a lot of practising to do.
"
,,
2,20," Practisin'? What for?
"
,,
2,20," The competition.
"
,,
2,20," You're gonna be my first champion.
"
,,
2,20," Oh, play that sad walking-away song
"
,,
2,20,"From The Incredible Hulk.
"
,,
2,20,"Hey! Everyone! Look at me!
"
,,
2,20,"Look, look! Look at me.
"
,,
2,20,"Hey, thanks! You think
"
,,
2,20,"that was great? Watch this!
"
,,
2,20,"Uh-oh! Lois! I'm losin' my buzz!
"
,,
2,20," I need more talent juice.
"
,,
2,20," Another beer already?
"
,,
2,20,"Oh, well, I guess I don't have
"
,,
2,20,"to be prepared for the competition...
"
,,
2,20,"I need another pitcher over here.
"
,,
2,20,"Wow. Lois must've written
"
,,
2,20,"the book on man-pleasin'.
"
,,
2,20,"Too bad Loretta doesn't allow
"
,,
2,20,"white literature in our household.
"
,,
2,20,"Well, how much harm
"
,,
2,20,"can one more pitcher do?
"
,,
2,20," This is all for the sake of art, right?
"
,,
2,20," Don't start with me, Brian.
"
,,
2,20,"This may not be my proudest moment,
"
,,
2,20,"but damn it, I wanna win.
"
,,
2,20,"You're not the first person
"
,,
2,20,"to do whatever it takes to win.
"
,,
2,20,"You come to me and ask me
"
,,
2,20,"to kill a man I do not know.
"
,,
2,20,"Now I ask you, why should
"
,,
2,20,"I kill this... Count Chocula?
"
,,
2,20,"That son of a bitch has been spreading lies.
"
,,
2,20,"My cereal does not
"
,,
2,20,"cut the roof of your mouth!
"
,,
2,20,"With all respect.
"
,,
2,20,"I can't believe I'm missing
"
,,
2,20,"Ronnie's party for this.
"
,,
2,20,"That Ronnie's a bad influence.
"
,,
2,20,"Yeah. That little bastard
"
,,
2,20,"sold me some bad crack.
"
,,
2,20,"Stay out of it, Herb.
"
,,
2,20,"You're not even his real father.
"
,,
2,20,"Yes, we're checking in.
"
,,
2,20,"The student's name is Peter Griffin.
"
,,
2,20," Oh, yes. He's on in an hour.
"
,,
2,20," Where's the nearest liquor store?
"
,,
2,20,"They're all closed on Sundays.
"
,,
2,20,"This is a dry county.
"
,,
2,20,"I can't do it without booze.
"
,,
2,20,"Maybe this is a sign that we need to stop this.
"
,,
2,20,"I've been keeping you ripped out of
"
,,
2,20,"your head for my own selfish needs.
"
,,
2,20,"I'm ashamed. Let's just go home.
"
,,
2,20,"No, no, Lois, we can't stop now
"
,,
2,20,"after all we've put into this.
"
,,
2,20,"Yo, Fresh? How do I get to Ronnie's party?
"
,,
2,20,"Oh, Peter, we're not goin'
"
,,
2,20,"to a high-school party.
"
,,
2,20," Lois.
"
,,
2,20," Alexis.
"
,,
2,20," Loser says ""what"".
"
,,
2,20," What?
"
,,
2,20,"Oh! I'll drive.
"
,,
2,20,"Consume.
"
,,
2,20," I love you so much.
"
,,
2,20," This sucks.
"
,,
2,20,"Well, you know, when I was your age,
"
,,
2,20,"we had way better drinkin' games.
"
,,
2,20," Ow.
"
,,
2,20," Ha, ha! You drink.
"
,,
2,20," It's the cops!
"
,,
2,20," Run!
"
,,
2,20,"Hold it, you two. Aren't you
"
,,
2,20,"a little old to be drinking illegally?
"
,,
2,20,"Uh... uh... Lois, look over there!
"
,,
2,20,"Run!
"
,,
2,20,"I wanna make you feel beautiful, Lois.
"
,,
2,20,"Oh, Peter, stop. Try to stay focused.
"
,,
2,20,"OK. You're on. Wait!
"
,,
2,20,"Here's a little something for good luck.
"
,,
2,20,"Make your trills clean and watch
"
,,
2,20,"the legato in the fourth measure. Go!
"
,,
2,20,"Ha, ha, ha, ha! Ha!
"
,,
2,20,"We did it, Brian!
"
,,
2,20," Congratulations, Lois.
"
,,
2,20," For what?
"
,,
2,20,"Winnin' a trophy at the expense
"
,,
2,20,"of my husband's health?
"
,,
2,20,"Oh, God knows how many
"
,,
2,20,"of his brain cells I killed,
"
,,
2,20,"pourin' all that alcohol down his throat.
"
,,
2,20,"Lois, you don't get it.
"
,,
2,20,"The lesson here is that abusing alcohol
"
,,
2,20,"has absolutely no negative consequences.
"
,,
2,20,"You have the trophy
"
,,
2,20,"and my brain cells are just fine.
"
,,
2,20,"Hello? Where... where is everybody?
"
,,
2,20,"I'm... I'm the only brain cell left!
"
,,
2,20,"Well, at least I have my books.
"
,,
2,20,"No! No, that... that's not fair.

"
,,
2,21,"Mary, you're doing great with your Braille.
"
,,
2,21,"I couldn't have done it without you, Pa.
"
,,
2,21,"Why don't you go up to bed
"
,,
2,21,"and get some sleep, honey?
"
,,
2,21,"Sh.
"
,,
2,21,"Honey! Honey, you remember
"
,,
2,21,"where the stool was.
"
,,
2,21,"Oh, Mary, Mary. You're in the kitchen.
"
,,
2,21,"You're all disoriented. Let me help you.
"
,,
2,21," The ladder's right here.
"
,,
2,21," Thanks, Pa.
"
,,
2,21,"Jeez, life was a lot tougher back then.
"
,,
2,21,"It seems today that all you see
"
,,
2,21,"Is violence in movies and sex on TV
"
,,
2,21,"But where are those
"
,,
2,21,"good old-fashioned values
"
,,
2,21,"On which we used to rely?
"
,,
2,21,"Lucky there's a family guy
"
,,
2,21,"Lucky there's a man who positively
"
,,
2,21,"can do all the things that make us
"
,,
2,21,"Laugh and cry
"
,,
2,21,"He's a family guy
"
,,
2,21,"Listen up. It's time for spring-cleaning.
"
,,
2,21,"Spring-cleaning? Oh, not again!
"
,,
2,21,"That was weird.
"
,,
2,21,"That was weird, too.
"
,,
2,21,"If we all pitch in, we'll be done in no time.
"
,,
2,21,"You know I swore I'd never clean again. Not
"
,,
2,21,"after Bounty dropped me as their spokesman.
"
,,
2,21,"Wait a second. Rosie, I've just poured this
"
,,
2,21,"glass of warm yellow liquid on the counter,
"
,,
2,21,"and you say that Bounty
"
,,
2,21,"can pick it up in five seconds?
"
,,
2,21," What is this? Is that...?
"
,,
2,21," Four seconds.
"
,,
2,21," It smells like...
"
,,
2,21," Clean my pee!
"
,,
2,21,"Mom, I can't clean. I got stuff to do.
"
,,
2,21,"Sweetheart, we all know
"
,,
2,21,"you don't have any stuff to do.
"
,,
2,21,"I don't wanna hear any more
"
,,
2,21,"excuses from anyone.
"
,,
2,21,"Ah, crap!
"
,,
2,21,"We did it again.
"
,,
2,21,"Ruth Bader Ginsberg.
"
,,
2,21,"Ooh!
"
,,
2,21,"Oh, look, Meg. It's your little baby booties.
"
,,
2,21,"Oh, and your little bronzed hat.
"
,,
2,21,"And your tail.
"
,,
2,21," My what?!
"
,,
2,21," Nothing.
"
,,
2,21,"OK. Lois's list says clean the windows,
"
,,
2,21,"clear the gutters and wash the siding.
"
,,
2,21,"To most folks, that's three chores.
"
,,
2,21,"To Peter Griffin and his big hose, it's one.
"
,,
2,21,"You're not workin' hard, Peter.
"
,,
2,21,"You're workin' smart.
"
,,
2,21,"Hey, Chris, gimme the juice.
"
,,
2,21,"Peter, there's water and glass and...
"
,,
2,21,"It's a disaster in here!
"
,,
2,21,"Well, Lois, why don't you put down your
"
,,
2,21,"ginger ale and Redbook and get to work?
"
,,
2,21,"Lazy.
"
,,
2,21,"You're not helping. Look, don't come
"
,,
2,21,"near the house. Go do somethin' else.
"
,,
2,21," Son, this duffel bag is only half zipped.
"
,,
2,21," Where you goin'?
"
,,
2,21,"I'm goin' campin' for the weekend with
"
,,
2,21,"Johnny Cut-Corners. Want to come along?
"
,,
2,21,"Hm. It would be nice to get out of the house.
"
,,
2,21,"This is the time of the month
"
,,
2,21,"when Loretta's visited by her Aunt Flo.
"
,,
2,21,"Loretta likes to personify
"
,,
2,21,"her menses in humorous ways.
"
,,
2,21,"Hey, Quagmire, you up for some campin'?
"
,,
2,21,"Sorry, bud. The only tent
"
,,
2,21,"I'm pitchin' this weekend is...
"
,,
2,21,"Well, you see where I'm goin' with this. Oh!
"
,,
2,21,"I wanna go. It'll get me away from
"
,,
2,21,"the evil monkey that lives in my closet.
"
,,
2,21,"Monkey in the closet!
"
,,
2,21,"This is gonna be great.
"
,,
2,21,"My last male bonding was when
"
,,
2,21,"me and Cleveland went to Chinatown.
"
,,
2,21,"Look, forget how it happened.
"
,,
2,21,"Can you just get us outta this?
"
,,
2,21,"I say, Rupert, this paste is quite delicious.
"
,,
2,21,"It's almost worth the bowel obstruction.
"
,,
2,21,"Are those my books?
"
,,
2,21,"What the hell are you doing?
"
,,
2,21,"Papier-mch. I used them to make the
"
,,
2,21,"houseboat from Surfside Six.  You remember.
"
,,
2,21,"Surfside Six
"
,,
2,21,"Who lives there?
"
,,
2,21,"Surfside Six
"
,,
2,21,"Young bachelors.
"
,,
2,21,"In Miami Beach
"
,,
2,21,"Those are my first editions. You little punk!
"
,,
2,21,"Momma, doggy's scary.
"
,,
2,21,"Brian, have you lost your mind? He's just
"
,,
2,21,"a baby. He doesn't know what he's doing.
"
,,
2,21," This isn't over.
"
,,
2,21," If you're looking for your Dostoevsky,
"
,,
2,21,"I used it to make the fort from F Troop.
"
,,
2,21,"Look what I found, Stewie.
"
,,
2,21,"An appointment card. You've got a checkup.
"
,,
2,21,"Marvellous. A quick weigh-in, stick out your
"
,,
2,21,"tongue, and a nice lollipop to cap it all off.
"
,,
2,21,"Remind me to ask the doctor
"
,,
2,21,"when my other testicle will descend.
"
,,
2,21,"Bang! I'm Daniel Boone.
"
,,
2,21,"I'm a man. I'm a big man.
"
,,
2,21,"Bang! Bang!
"
,,
2,21,"Now I'm Pat Boone. Gonna have
"
,,
2,21,"a Christmas special with Andy Williams.
"
,,
2,21,"Ah, so beautiful.
"
,,
2,21,"It's almost as if this world
"
,,
2,21,"was created especially for me.
"
,,
2,21," You think he's onto us, Christof?
"
,,
2,21," No. He's an idiot.
"
,,
2,21,"I dug the latrine 50 feet out.
"
,,
2,21,"Great. You want a cookie whenever you
"
,,
2,21,"do somethin' right? Get some firewood.
"
,,
2,21," Yes, sir!
"
,,
2,21," He's gonna grow up to be quite a man.
"
,,
2,21,"Hmm. That was incredible, Kevin.
"
,,
2,21," I'm not here to impress you. Am I, Dad?
"
,,
2,21," Did I say you could rest yet?
"
,,
2,21,"I'm Abe Lincoln. I just chopped some wood.
"
,,
2,21,"Good for you, son. Hey, where's Chris?
"
,,
2,21,"I asked him to fill the canteens an hour ago.
"
,,
2,21,"Hey, Dad, look!
"
,,
2,21,"I covered my back with honey,
"
,,
2,21,"and now the ants are takin' me home.
"
,,
2,21,"He does that at home
"
,,
2,21,"with Velveeta and cockroaches.
"
,,
2,21,"If you turn the light on,
"
,,
2,21,"they slam him into the fridge.
"
,,
2,21,"Oh, great! Mirabella.
"
,,
2,21,"December's Mirabella!
"
,,
2,21,"What's your story?
"
,,
2,21,"Get lost on the way to the morgue?
"
,,
2,21,"Seriously, is that yours?
"
,,
2,21,"Because if it is, bravo!
"
,,
2,21,"You remember that short-lived sitcom Fish?
"
,,
2,21,"They should have put that on before CHiPs.
"
,,
2,21,"The marketing practically writes itself.
"
,,
2,21,"Let's go, Chris. Your dinner won't catch itself.
"
,,
2,21,"I don't wanna go.
"
,,
2,21,"I had a bad experience with a fish once.
"
,,
2,21,"Oh, my God! My fish is gone!
"
,,
2,21,"And he robbed me!
"
,,
2,21," OK. See you, Chris.
"
,,
2,21," This is none of my business,
"
,,
2,21,"but you're turning your boy into a slacker.
"
,,
2,21,"How dare you call
"
,,
2,21,"my parenting into question?!
"
,,
2,21,"If you were a woman, I'd slug you.
"
,,
2,21,"You should teach him some responsibility.
"
,,
2,21,"I'll show you responsibility.
"
,,
2,21,"Chris, you are responsible for
"
,,
2,21,"guarding the camp while we fish.
"
,,
2,21,"You got it, Dad. You can count on me to...
"
,,
2,21,"Chris, pay attention. I want you to...
"
,,
2,21,"All right, take a deep breath.
"
,,
2,21,"It's cold. Cold!
"
,,
2,21,"OK. I'm fine. I'm fine.
"
,,
2,21,"Tell me, Dr Hartman,
"
,,
2,21,"do all the children fall in love with you?
"
,,
2,21,"It's cold! It's cold.
"
,,
2,21,"Hm. 29Ib. That's big for your age.
"
,,
2,21,"Forgive me for not being one of those
"
,,
2,21,"anorexic babies from the diaper commercials.
"
,,
2,21," Time for your immunisations.
"
,,
2,21," You might wanna hold him.
"
,,
2,21,"Hold me for what?
"
,,
2,21," What the deuce?
"
,,
2,21," Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.
"
,,
2,21,"Back off! Don't come
"
,,
2,21,"any closer or I'll cut her.
"
,,
2,21,"I... I'll give her...
"
,,
2,21,"I'll give her a series
"
,,
2,21,"of splinters that could, um...
"
,,
2,21,"you know, become infected.
"
,,
2,21,"Look, Stewie. Look at the dancin' kitty.
"
,,
2,21,"Oh, no! I'll not be taken in by one of your...
"
,,
2,21,"Oh, my! That's delightful, isn't it?
"
,,
2,21,"What's your name?
"
,,
2,21,"Argh! Oh, God!
"
,,
2,21,"They call this the ""magic hour"":
"
,,
2,21,"the day's not quite gone,
"
,,
2,21,"but the night's not quite here,
"
,,
2,21,"and somewhere, Scott Baio
"
,,
2,21,"is ploughin' a woman he doesn't love.
"
,,
2,21,"I got one, Dad!
"
,,
2,21,"Looks like that's the one that got away.
"
,,
2,21,"The hell it is! You get in there
"
,,
2,21,"and you kick that fish's ass!
"
,,
2,21,"God, I love him.
"
,,
2,21,"I can't believe how terrible the fishin' was.
"
,,
2,21,"Yeah. All we caught was a tyre, a boot,
"
,,
2,21,"a tin can and this book of clichs.
"
,,
2,21,"Well, thank God we came prepared.
"
,,
2,21,"We brought enough food to last us...
"
,,
2,21,"Holy crap, Chris. What the hell?
"
,,
2,21,"I put you in charge of the food.
"
,,
2,21,"The raccoons were here. See?
"
,,
2,21,"""We're a bunch of sneaky animals.""
"
,,
2,21,"""We're gonna wreck this food
"
,,
2,21,"and eat it, cos we're naughty!""
"
,,
2,21,"""And then there's a guy. Let's get him
"
,,
2,21,"in trouble with his dad! Ha ha ha!""
"
,,
2,21,"Somehow, I'm less than surprised.
"
,,
2,21,"I'm sorry, Dad. I messed up the entire trip.
"
,,
2,21,"It's not your fault, Chris.
"
,,
2,21,"I failed you as a father.
"
,,
2,21,"From now on, Joe will be your father.
"
,,
2,21,"Cleveland?
"
,,
2,21,"I'll teach the boy. Come, my son.
"
,,
2,21,"I'll show you the ways of the herd...
"
,,
2,21,"Oh, crap.
"
,,
2,21,"Why are you sittin' with
"
,,
2,21,"the sheets over your head?
"
,,
2,21," Peter, what's wrong?
"
,,
2,21," Huh. That obvious?
"
,,
2,21,"Well, you always do the skull gag
"
,,
2,21,"when you're depressed. Talk to me.
"
,,
2,21,"Well, it's just... I've been tryin' to teach
"
,,
2,21,"Chris how to be a man, you know?
"
,,
2,21,"First I tried teachin' him how to eat an Oreo.
"
,,
2,21,"Chris, the way to eat an Oreo
"
,,
2,21,"is to twist it, pull it apart and lick it.
"
,,
2,21,"Now you.
"
,,
2,21,"Then I tried teachin' him
"
,,
2,21,"how to get out of payin' a check.
"
,,
2,21,"Uh, waiter? There's a dead guy in my soup.
"
,,
2,21,"Oh, terribly sorry, sir. Your soup is gratis.
"
,,
2,21,"Thank you.
"
,,
2,21,"Now your turn.
"
,,
2,21,"Waiter, there's a dead guy in my...
"
,,
2,21,"Peter, you can't force-feed maturity.
"
,,
2,21,"He needs to learn it on his own.
"
,,
2,21," Why don't you get him a job or somethin'?
"
,,
2,21," Whoa. Freeze-fame.
"
,,
2,21,"That's it! I can teach Chris
"
,,
2,21,"responsibility by gettin' him a job.
"
,,
2,21,"Isn't she great?
"
,,
2,21,"Now you see why I married her.
"
,,
2,21,"Go away now. I'm gonna do stuff to her.
"
,,
2,21,"I'm sorry Stewie ruined your books.
"
,,
2,21,"Here, I brought you some of Peter's.
"
,,
2,21,"Mr T by Mr T.
"
,,
2,21,"Tand Me by George Peppard.
"
,,
2,21,"For the Last Time, I'm not Mr T

"
,,
2,21,"Eurgh!
"
,,
2,21,"Oh, Stewie, are you OK?
"
,,
2,21,"Must we make small talk every time we pass?
"
,,
2,21,"Oh, you're burnin' up. Must be a reaction to
"
,,
2,21,"the shots. I'll go get you some baby aspirin.
"
,,
2,21,"What are you talking about? You said the
"
,,
2,21,"shots were supposed to make me healthy.
"
,,
2,21,"You actually believe Lois
"
,,
2,21,"had them inject you to make you healthy?
"
,,
2,21," I mean, you were already healthy.
"
,,
2,21," Oh, God! You're right.
"
,,
2,21,"I was pink as a pistol.
"
,,
2,21,"Pink as a pistol?! Good Lord!
"
,,
2,21,"I can't even form a cogent simile any more.
"
,,
2,21," What was in those needles?
"
,,
2,21," I've already said too much.
"
,,
2,21,"I should have known.
"
,,
2,21,"Her treachery knows no limits. I...
"
,,
2,21,"Oh, my. Getting dizzy.
"
,,
2,21,"Oh, fight it, Stewie!

2,21,"To quote Bob Dylan.
"
,,
2,21,"No, no. Dylan Thomas.
"
,,
2,21,"Boys, I'm a miracle worker.
"
,,
2,21,"I have used all my parenting skills
"
,,
2,21,"to change my son from
"
,,
2,21,"a lazy slacker into a workin' man.
"
,,
2,21," Nice goin', Peter.
"
,,
2,21," Yeah. Up yours.
"
,,
2,21," What?
"
,,
2,21," Thanks. Hey, Chris.
"
,,
2,21,"Hey, Dad. I'm workin'. I'm wor...
"
,,
2,21," Oh!
"
,,
2,21," Careful. You don't get dental for 60 days.
"
,,
2,21,"Hey, you that Griffin boy's father?
"
,,
2,21,"Paddy Tanninger, the caddy manager.
"
,,
2,21,"Yeah, it rhymes. Big whoop.
"
,,
2,21,"Wanna fight about it?
"
,,
2,21,"Listen, your son is
"
,,
2,21,"the best ball-shagger we ever had.
"
,,
2,21,"I sold twice as many buckets today
"
,,
2,21,"cos everybody wants to hit the fat kid.
"
,,
2,21,"Lynne, cancel my meetings.
"
,,
2,21,"I gotta hit more balls at this fat kid.
"
,,
2,21," Peter, do you mind if Kevin and I...?
"
,,
2,21," Nail Chris? He'd be thrilled.
"
,,
2,21,"Hey, this kid here
"
,,
2,21,"just knocked the ball 300 yards.
"
,,
2,21,"I'm Tiger Woods. I'm Tiger Woods. Weeee!
"
,,
2,21,"Cleveland, your kid's a natural.
"
,,
2,21,"With help, he could be a pro.
"
,,
2,21,"Oh, Peter, I can't make
"
,,
2,21,"Cleveland Junior sit still for anything.
"
,,
2,21,"Sometimes I wonder if he's got the epilepsy.
"
,,
2,21,"But then I just go see what's on the TV.
"
,,
2,21,"Well, maybe you're not
"
,,
2,21,"as good a father as me, huh?
"
,,
2,21,"Look what I did with Chris.
"
,,
2,21,"I'm better than that dad on Lost in Space.
"
,,
2,21,"We need more information
"
,,
2,21,"about this new planet.
"
,,
2,21,"Don, you take my 16- year-old blonde
"
,,
2,21,"daughter out in the chariot for the day.
"
,,
2,21,"Penny, you stay here with me. And Will?
"
,,
2,21,"You and the robot go out into the wilderness
"
,,
2,21,"and take this mincing paedophile with you.
"
,,
2,21,"Cleveland Junior's beyond your skills.
"
,,
2,21,"He won't respond to you.
"
,,
2,21,"Oh, yeah? Hey. Hey, come here,
"
,,
2,21,"Cleveland Junior. Come to Peter.
"
,,
2,21," Over here, Junior.
"
,,
2,21," Come on.
"
,,
2,21," Come on, Cleveland Junior.
"
,,
2,21," Come to Peter.
"
,,
2,21,"Huh? You'll see. I'm gonna turn this kid
"
,,
2,21,"into the greatest golfer ever.
"
,,
2,21,"Fine.
"
,,
2,21," How'd you get him to come?
"
,,
2,21," With this.
"
,,
2,21,"Oh.
"
,,
2,21," Love.
"
,,
2,21," Jealousy.
"
,,
2,21," Touch.
"
,,
2,21," Forever.
"
,,
2,21," Intense.
"
,,
2,21," Passion.
"
,,
2,21,"Obsession. Calvin Klein.
"
,,
2,21,"Drink this, honey. It'll bring your fever down.
"
,,
2,21,"I'm gonna go run you a cool bath.
"
,,
2,21,"She's one of them. I'm sure of it.
"
,,
2,21,"Tell me what they injected me with!
"
,,
2,21,"Huh! You know Mr T always
"
,,
2,21,"wanted to be a Broadway dancer?
"
,,
2,21,"Answer me! What have they done to me?
"
,,
2,21,"It could be any number of things.
"
,,
2,21,"Gene manipulation, sterilisation...
"
,,
2,21," Not my seed!
"
,,
2,21," But from the look of your pupils,
"
,,
2,21,"I'd say it's some kind of mind-control serum.
"
,,
2,21,"Or not.
"
,,
2,21,"Mind control? But I feel so lucid.
"
,,
2,21,"You look spot-on to me.
"
,,
2,21,"Thank you. I try to work out.
"
,,
2,21,"But who has the time?
"
,,
2,21,"Besides trophy wives.
"
,,
2,21,"Yes. That's rich.
"
,,
2,21,"Agh!
"
,,
2,21,"Didn't wanna be a mean guy.

"

2,21," Why is he freaking out like that?
"
,,
2,21," He's having an hallucination from the fever.
"
,,
2,21,"Like when you were three,
"
,,
2,21,"and you ate those adult brownies
"

2,21,"I was saving for the Doobie Brothers concert.

2,21,"And, uh... just once, for me,

2,21,"Look, here's your first week's pay.
"

2,21,"All right, Chris!
"

2,21," Dad! Dad, look!
"
,,
2,21," That's great, Chris.
"
,,
2,21,"But I'm tryin' to be a good father here.
"
,,
2,21,"I'm real proud of you, champ.
"
,,
2,21," Let's go get a milkshake.
"
,,
2,21," You got it, Mr Drummond.
"
,,
2,21,"Package for Glen Quagmire.
"
,,
2,21,"Oh, excuse me.
"
,,
2,21,"I got a package for you, too. All right.
"
,,
2,21,"Nice try, but I built up an immunity.
"
,,
2,21," Hey, what's wrong, kid?
"
,,
2,21," My dad doesn't care about me any more.
"
,,
2,21,"Oh. Well, at least you have a dad. When I
"
,,
2,21,"was growin' up, it was just me and my mom.
"
,,
2,21,"Wah! Wah! Wah!
"
,,
2,21," Oh, looks like somebody's hungry.
"
,,
2,21," Wah! Wah!
"
,,
2,21,"All right!
"
,,
2,21,"I just wanted him to be proud of me.
"
,,
2,21,"I even got a job.
"
,,
2,21,"Well, there's your problem.
"
,,
2,21,"Jobs are for suckers.
"
,,
2,21,"You need to learn how
"
,,
2,21,"to have a good time. Come on.
"
,,
2,21," Go ahead, kid. Try it out.
"
,,
2,21," Um, excuse me.
"
,,
2,21,"You dropped something.
"
,,
2,21,"My jaw. Ha ha ha ha.
"
,,
2,21,"All right.
"

"
,,
2,21,"We're gonna all hang ten and maybe then
"
,,
2,21,"Hic-a-doo-La!
"
,,
2,21,"Cos I'm a hic-a-doo-La boy
"
,,
2,21,"And I'm a hic-a-doo-La girl
"
,,
2,21,"And together it is a hic-a-doo-La world
"
,,
2,21,"Hic-a-doo-La!
"
,,
2,21,"Mr Quagmire,
"
,,
2,21,"what does ""hic-a-doo-La"" mean?
"
,,
2,21,"What does ""hic-a-doo-La"" mean?
"
,,
2,21,"Hic-a-doo-La's that feeling when
"
,,
2,21,"you hold hands with your best gal.
"
,,
2,21," It's cheerin' for the home team.
"
,,
2,21," It's catchin' the perfect wave.
"
,,
2,21,"It's obeying all the rules.
"
,,
2,21,"No way!
"
,,
2,21,"Hey, are we in Tiananmen?
"
,,
2,21,"Because I see a square.
"
,,
2,21,"Hic-a-doo-La!
"
,,
2,21," Hey, great shot, Cleveland Junior.
"
,,
2,21," Thanks, Mr Drummond.
"
,,
2,21,"Listen, for today, can you switch
"
,,
2,21,"and call me Mr Papadapolis?
"
,,
2,21," You got it.
"
,,
2,21," Would you hate me if I called you Webster?
"
,,
2,21," That's a lie.
"
,,
2,21," OK. Sorry.
"
,,
2,21,"Hi. Tom Tucker, local news anchor.
"
,,
2,21,"And on my days off, a golf enthusiast.
"
,,
2,21,"The club's having a man-boy tournament.
"
,,
2,21,"You should enter.
"
,,
2,21,"A tournament, eh?
"
,,
2,21,"That gives me an idea.
"
,,
2,21,"Come on. I'll explain in the car.
"
,,
2,21,"This is the perfect way to show what a great
"
,,
2,21,"father figure I've been to Cleveland Junior.
"
,,
2,21,"I'll do it!
"
,,
2,21," Where shall we sit?
"
,,
2,21," That's not up to me, kid.
"
,,
2,21,"I follow the old divining rod. Whoa!
"
,,
2,21,"Whoa-ho!
"
,,
2,21," How old are you?
"
,,
2,21," Old enough to know you're a whore.
"
,,
2,21,"Whoa!
"
,,
2,21,"Whoa ho-ho!
"
,,
2,21,"Whoa ho-ho-ho ho-ho!
"
,,
2,21,"Come on, talk to me, sweetie.
"
,,
2,21,"You look a little down.
"
,,
2,21,"I always thought I'd go to my first nudie bar
"
,,
2,21,"with my dad. He doesn't have time for me.
"
,,
2,21,"Well, sweetie, part of growing up
"
,,
2,21,"is learning that adults aren't perfect.
"
,,
2,21," Your dad deserves another chance.
"
,,
2,21," Wow! You are smart.
"
,,
2,21,"All right.
"
,,
2,21,"Oh, no. No, it's not all right.
"
,,
2,21,"I'm outta cash. You take bank cards?
"
,,
2,21,"Sure.
"
,,
2,21,"Can I get stamps, too?
"
,,
2,21,"We are at the 17th hole, where Peter Griffin
"
,,
2,21,"and Cleveland Junior are five strokes ahead,
"
,,
2,21,"making victory all but a certainty.
"
,,
2,21,"I said I could mould
"
,,
2,21,"your son into a champion.
"
,,
2,21,"This is gonna be my greatest victory ever.
"
,,
2,21,"Except for the time I defeated my evil twin.
"
,,
2,21,"Not me, Lois. Shoot him. I'm the real Peter.
"
,,
2,21," I don't know.
"
,,
2,21," Lois, look at me.
"
,,
2,21,"You know your own husband, don't you?
"
,,
2,21,"Thank God!
"
,,
2,21,"You made the right choice, honey.
"
,,
2,21," What was that?
"
,,
2,21," Nothing.
"
,,
2,21,"One more hole, and that man-boy trophy
"
,,
2,21,"is ours. Here you go, little buddy.
"
,,
2,21,"Hey, look at me. I'm Pel. I'm Pel.
"
,,
2,21,"Goal!
"
,,
2,21,"Where the hell's he goin'?
"
,,
2,21,"He's gone. Maybe you better
"
,,
2,21,"stick to lookin' after your own son.
"
,,
2,21,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
2,21," Is she dead?
"
,,
2,21," She's still alive...
"
,,
2,21,"No, that did it.

3,1,"does that make you a schnozage?

3,1," Did you stay up all night writing that?
"
,,
3,1," I got to bed around 2.30.
"
,,
3,1,"You know the street value of that cocaine?
"
,,
3,1,"Let's see. Four and a half kilos

3,1,"for blessing me with this nose.
"
,,
3,1,"And a few other equally amazing

3,1,"You gotta tell me your secret.
"
,,
3,1,"Here's a hint - put down the fork! Face!

3,1,"So, how was your day?

3,1,"staring back at you, mocking you.
"
,,
3,1,"Blah! Blah! Blah!
"
,,
3,1,"Knowin' the perverted truths that rot in the pit
"
,,
3,1,"of your soul. That's how my freakin' day was.
"
,,
3,1,"You know what I haven't had in a while?
"
,,
3,1,"Big League Chew.
"
,,
3,1,"So take it from me - McGriffin, the drug dog.
"
,,
3,1,"If you really wanna get high,
"
,,
3,1,"it's as easy as being yourself.
"
,,
3,1,"Well, kids, I'm gonna pass things off now to...
"
,,
3,1,"Gerald, the happy and abstinent police clown.
"
,,
3,1,"Hey, kids! You know why I'm happy?
"
,,
3,1,"Cos I'm free of S... T... Ds!
"
,,
3,1," That McGriffin guy was so cool!
"
,,
3,1," Totally. I'm never doing drugs now.
"
,,
3,1,"Ahhhhh.
"
,,
3,1,"Got milk?
"
,,
3,1,"Before you go on a cruise,
"
,,
3,1,"you gotta build up a base tan.
"
,,
3,1,"But I heard that if you use tanning beds,
"
,,
3,1,"you could get something called melanoma.
"
,,
3,1,"Oh, that's just fancy talk
"
,,
3,1,"for sexified. Now, climb in.
"
,,
3,1," Hey, what kinda tanning booth is this?
"
,,
3,1," Those aren't tanning booths.
"
,,
3,1," That row is time machines.
"
,,
3,1," Oh, crap! Where the hell is he?
"
,,
3,1,"Hey, Dad, I'm in the Bible days, and there's
"
,,
3,1,"a whole stadium of people clappin' for me.
"
,,
3,1,"Oh, look, my very own lion!
"
,,
3,1,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,1,"Must've got the wrong hat.
"
,,
3,1,"And now, here's something
"
,,
3,1,"we hope you'll really like.
"
,,
3,1,"There's no smokin' in the terminal.
"
,,
3,1,"There's worse things than nicotine.
"
,,
3,1,"And I'm gonna find 'em.
"
,,
3,1,"Patience. It took St Patrick more
"
,,
3,1,"than a day to clear the Emerald Isle of snakes.
"
,,
3,1," Can the Irish crap, will you, Horowicz?
"
,,
3,1," OK.
"
,,
3,1," Open it!
"
,,
3,1," Agh! Let me go!
"
,,
3,1,"Help! Help!
"
,,
3,1,"Where's the stash? I'll do
"
,,
3,1,"a freakin' body-cavity search.
"
,,
3,1," Argh! Argh!
"
,,
3,1," Sir, we apologise.
"
,,
3,1,"There's no easy way to say this.
"
,,
3,1,"You have a drug problem.
"
,,
3,1,"A drug problem? What's this really about?
"
,,
3,1,"Jealousy? Am I stealin' your thunder?
"
,,
3,1," Give me your badge.
"
,,
3,1," Fine!
"
,,
3,1,"By the way, Horowicz, you should
"
,,
3,1,"show Joe your impression of him.
"
,,
3,1,"Oh, well... It's not as good as my
"
,,
3,1,"Irish cop. It's just a little thing I...
"
,,
3,1,"""I'm Joe! My legs don't work, but I make up
"
,,
3,1,"for it by having a very strong upper body. ""
"
,,
3,1,"Well, I do say that.
"
,,
3,1,"The Old Man and the Sea. I see you're
"
,,
3,1,"gettin' in the mood for our cruise.
"
,,
3,1,"Yeah. Stupid fisherman. Sittin' out there
"
,,
3,1,"on a boat yammerin' to himself.
"
,,
3,1,"He doesn't even know I'm watching him.
"
,,
3,1,"Ah, splendid. Fido McCoke-Fiend is home.
"
,,
3,1," Everybody, this is Tina.
"
,,
3,1," What happened to you?
"
,,
3,1,"Less questions and more shut-the-hell-up.
"
,,
3,1,"Just because you can't feel your teeth
"
,,
3,1,"doesn't mean the girl can't feel your insults.
"
,,
3,1,"Hello. I'm Lois Griffin. Welcome to our home.
"
,,
3,1,"So, what? She's, like,
"
,,
3,1,"your mom or somethin'?
"
,,
3,1,"Tina, can I get you a warm washcloth to
"
,,
3,1,"wipe the dried blood from under your nose?
"
,,
3,1," Here's the channel Lois doesn't know about.
"
,,
3,1," Chris, look away! Meg, take Stewie upstairs.
"
,,
3,1,"Wait. That man seems to have
"
,,
3,1,"suffered a serious snakebite.
"
,,
3,1,"Brian, would you please ask
"
,,
3,1,"your new friend to leave now?
"
,,
3,1,"Oh, sorry. Things gettin'
"
,,
3,1,"too real for the Stepford wife?
"
,,
3,1,"And look at you two - Quasimodo and
"
,,
3,1,"Lumpy.
"
,,
3,1,"I leave more personality in
"
,,
3,1,"tightly-coiled piles on the lawn.
"
,,
3,1,"Oh, do me! Do me next!
"
,,
3,1,"Come on, baby girl. Let's go to the park.
"
,,
3,1," Hey, Doc. What are you doing here?
"
,,
3,1," Your family has something to say.
"
,,
3,1,"Brian, I know I don't speak up much,
"
,,
3,1,"and it's really hard for me to
"
,,
3,1,"talk about my feelings, but...
"
,,
3,1,"Let's start with someone
"
,,
3,1,"more interesting. Peter?
"
,,
3,1,"Ever since your addiction,
"
,,
3,1,"you've been a jerk.
"
,,
3,1,"I miss the old days
"
,,
3,1,"when you were my sidekick.
"
,,
3,1,"Uh... so she hated my tie until I told her it was
"
,,
3,1,"made out of 100 per cent Buttafuco fibre.
"
,,
3,1,"Uh, yeah, yeah.
"
,,
3,1,"Uh... yeah.
"
,,
3,1,"Yeah. Eeh. Yeah.
"
,,
3,1,"Brian, how about a little tie music?
"
,,
3,1,"""Peter's tie, Peter's tie
"
,,
3,1,"""That's because Peter's the guy!
"
,,
3,1,"All right. That's it. A little tie music.
"
,,
3,1,"Heh-hee!
"
,,
3,1,"Yeah!
"
,,
3,1,"Look, you-you guys got it
"
,,
3,1,"all wrong. I-I-I... I wa...
"
,,
3,1,"Oh, I'm so sorry, everyone!
"
,,
3,1,"Oh, God, I need help!
"
,,
3,1,"I guess now we know what kind of dog he is.
"
,,
3,1,"A melan-collie.
"
,,
3,1,"Nothing? Oh, wait, wait, wait.
"
,,
3,1,"I should have said ""Chi-wah-wah"".
"
,,
3,1,"I don't have to impress you.
"
,,
3,1,"Look, I'm not insensitive, Lois.
"
,,
3,1,"But why do we have to cancel our cruise
"
,,
3,1,"just cos the dog's a cokehead?
"
,,
3,1,"We're not going on vacation while Brian's
"
,,
3,1,"in rehab. We'll just have to wait till next year.
"
,,
3,1,"Aw, man!
"
,,
3,1,"I'll make it up to you.
"
,,
3,1,"My cousin works at Club Med.
"
,,
3,1,"Holy crap! Look at this place.
"
,,
3,1,"This is where God would come
"
,,
3,1,"if he had to stop doin' blow.
"
,,
3,1," They have tennis courts!
"
,,
3,1," And a full spa!
"
,,
3,1,"Wow! No wonder people do drugs!
"
,,
3,1,"Good luck, Brian. I just know
"
,,
3,1,"you're gonna get clean.
"
,,
3,1,"Shouldn't be too hard to get clean with
"
,,
3,1,"all these mineral baths and jacuzzis.
"
,,
3,1,"Oh, I see. The fat man makes a pun
"
,,
3,1,"and everyone wets themselves.
"
,,
3,1,"I give you gold and I get squat.
"
,,
3,1,"I'll be in the car.
"
,,
3,1,"That was a very productive first day, Brian.
"
,,
3,1,"Our goal here is to find your X factor -
"
,,
3,1,"the element in your life
"
,,
3,1,"that made you turn to drugs.
"
,,
3,1,"Just having some time away to sort things
"
,,
3,1,"out is gonna do wonders. Thanks, Doctor.
"
,,
3,1,"What are you doing here?
"
,,
3,1,"I'm on vacation. Oh, and if
"
,,
3,1,"anyone asks, I'm also on smack.
"
,,
3,1,"Peter, this is a detox clinic.
"
,,
3,1,"You can't vacation here.
"
,,
3,1,"Why not? This place is
"
,,
3,1,"way better than a cruise.
"
,,
3,1,"I whipped this speedfreak's ass
"
,,
3,1,"at horseshoes today.
"
,,
3,1,"This isn't a vacation for me.
"
,,
3,1,"I'm tryin' to get healthy.
"
,,
3,1,"Yeah, OK. All right.
"
,,
3,1,"Hey, softball this afternoon.
"
,,
3,1,"Us addicts are takin' on the pregnant
"
,,
3,1,"teenagers from across the lake.
"
,,
3,1,"OK, come on, everyone. Exercise
"
,,
3,1,"is an important part of recovery.
"
,,
3,1,"Just work with the resistance of the water.
"
,,
3,1,"Ten more reps. And one. And two.
"
,,
3,1,"And three.
"
,,
3,1,"Yeah! I'm also addicted to boobies!
"
,,
3,1,"Trade you this for your cupcake.
"
,,
3,1,"What? It was just Carpet Fresh.
"
,,
3,1,"I'm on your side.
"
,,
3,1,"I've been observing your behaviour. I don't
"
,,
3,1,"think you're an addict. I think you're an idiot.
"
,,
3,1,"Well, I don't pay you to think, hot lips.
"
,,
3,1,"In fact, I don't pay you at all. Count it.
"
,,
3,1,"I'll be keeping my eye on you.
"
,,
3,1,"What's your name?
"
,,
3,1,"Uh, my-my name? Uh...
"
,,
3,1,"Uh... uh... uh...
"
,,
3,1,"Pea... uh... uh... uh...
"
,,
3,1,"Tear... uh...
"
,,
3,1,"Uh... Griffin.
"
,,
3,1,"Yeah. Yeah. Peter Griffin.
"
,,
3,1,"Oh, crap.
"
,,
3,1,"I was lookin' for you. You wanna go mess
"
,,
3,1,"with the pregnant teens across the lake?
"
,,
3,1,"I can't. Group therapy.
"
,,
3,1,"I saw one of those - more borin' than when
"
,,
3,1,"I was a security guard for George Harrison.
"
,,
3,1,"Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey! Quiet down up there!
"
,,
3,1,"You wacky Beatle.
"
,,
3,1,"I have made a lot of progress lately. Missing
"
,,
3,1,"one session wouldn't be the end of the world.
"
,,
3,1,"There you go.
"
,,
3,1," What do you think they put in the bug juice?
"
,,
3,1," Bugs?
"
,,
3,1,"No, they don't! Come on.
"
,,
3,1,"Shut up.
"
,,
3,1,"I hope you're proud of yourselves.
"
,,
3,1,"Sorry. I don't usually let Peter
"
,,
3,1,"talk me into this kinda stuff.
"
,,
3,1,"You have a pre-existing relationship
"
,,
3,1,"with this degenerate?
"
,,
3,1,"A degenerate, am I?
"
,,
3,1,"Well, you are a fastizio.
"
,,
3,1,"See? I can make up words too, sister.
"
,,
3,1," Well, I think we've found your X factor.
"
,,
3,1," You mean Peter?
"
,,
3,1,"His behaviour is a negative influence on you.
"
,,
3,1,"With your intelligence and sensitivity...
"
,,
3,1,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.
"
,,
3,1,"I made my own mistakes. All right?
"
,,
3,1,"This man took me into his home
"
,,
3,1,"and treated me like family.
"
,,
3,1," He's my best friend.
"
,,
3,1," And look where you've ended up.
"
,,
3,1,"You know, I think my therapy
"
,,
3,1,"here is complete.
"
,,
3,1,"I came here to get clean
"
,,
3,1,"and I did. So goodbye.
"
,,
3,1,"Brian, it's moments like this that make me
"
,,
3,1,"sad you're gonna die 50 years before I do.
"
,,
3,1,"""He was all coked up and we were choked up
"
,,
3,1,"""But now we're happy Brian's home,
"
,,
3,1,"cha-cha-cha!
"
,,
3,1,"I am serious, Lois.
"
,,
3,1,"You could be in show business.
"
,,
3,1," Hey, Meg. 18 yet?
"
,,
3,1," No.
"
,,
3,1," Chris, how are ya?
"
,,
3,1," I'm glad...
"
,,
3,1,"All right!
"
,,
3,1,"Brian, I feel guilty. If not for me,
"
,,
3,1,"you wouldn't have been exposed to that junk.
"
,,
3,1,"Joe, if I've learned anything
"
,,
3,1,"from my experience,
"
,,
3,1,"it's that we're all responsible
"
,,
3,1,"for our own destiny.
"
,,
3,1," And that's why I'm leaving.
"
,,
3,1," Leavin'? You can't leave.
"
,,
3,1,"I have to, Peter. For me. I love you all.
"
,,
3,1,"Aw!
"
,,
3,1,"Somebody say something.
"
,,
3,1,"Brian, wait!
"
,,
3,1,"Hold on a second.
"
,,
3,1,"Airport, please.
"
,,
3,2,"Previously on ""Family Guy"":
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, my God. Tell your father
"
,,
3,2,"not to start the car.
"
,,
3,2,"You want my badge number?
"
,,
3,2,"Here's my freakin' badge number!
"
,,
3,2," I can't lose this case.
"
,,
3,2," Lois, the case is already over.
"
,,
3,2,"Who did this to you?!
"
,,
3,2,"In all my research,
"
,,
3,2,"I've never seen a virus reproduce so fast.
"
,,
3,2,"Everyone I told about the file is dead.
"
,,
3,2,"What do you mean, ""Cut the blue wire""?
"
,,
3,2,"They're all blue.
"
,,
3,2,"Face it. He's never coming out of that coma.
"
,,
3,2,"Aaaargh!
"
,,
3,2,"Brian's gone to Los Angeles
"
,,
3,2,"to find himself.
"
,,
3,2,"""It seems today that all you see
"
,,
3,2,"""Is violence in movies and sex on TV
"
,,
3,2,"""But where are those
"
,,
3,2,"good old-fashioned values
"
,,
3,2,"""On which we used to rely?
"
,,
3,2,"""Lucky there's a family guy
"
,,
3,2,"""Lucky there's a man who positively can do
"
,,
3,2,"all the things that make us
"
,,
3,2,"""Laugh and cry
"
,,
3,2,"""He's a family guy
"
,,
3,2,"Don't throw out Brian's things.
"
,,
3,2,"He won't be in LA for ever.
"
,,
3,2,"He just needs to find himself.
"
,,
3,2,"He's not coming back, Lois.
"
,,
3,2,"He just walked out on us.
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, boy, did we have some good times.
"
,,
3,2,"Here it comes, buddy.
"
,,
3,2,"Argh! Oh, God! Oh, God!
"
,,
3,2,"Argh! Ow!
"
,,
3,2,"What are the odds? Argh!
"
,,
3,2,"If he does come back,
"
,,
3,2,"I want everything to be how he left it.
"
,,
3,2,"Easy! Massage the scalp.
"
,,
3,2,"You're washing a baby's hair, not
"
,,
3,2,"scrubbing vomit off your Christmas dress.
"
,,
3,2," We got a letter from Brian.
"
,,
3,2," Tell him I'm not here.
"
,,
3,2," Let me see.
"
,,
3,2," Argh! Argh!
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.
"
,,
3,2,"There. All better?
"
,,
3,2,"You are some piece of work, lady.
"
,,
3,2,"If you... Actually, yes, it is.
"
,,
3,2,"""Greetings from California.
"
,,
3,2,"I've been very busy. ""
"
,,
3,2,"""Having a great time trying
"
,,
3,2,"to make it as a writer in LA.""
"
,,
3,2,"""It's as easy as everyone thinks it is. ""
"
,,
3,2,"""I've been working the room
"
,,
3,2,"at a lot of Hollywood parties. "" Oh!
"
,,
3,2,"Bobby! Loved you in Raging Bull.
"
,,
3,2,"Hey, Jodie, how's the baby?
"
,,
3,2,"All right.
"
,,
3,2,"I need more cheese puffs. Oprah's off the
"
,,
3,2,"wagon. No toothpicks. She'll hurt herself.
"
,,
3,2,"Did you hear about Jason?
"
,,
3,2,"Paramount bought his script.
"
,,
3,2," They bought Death Spares Not the Tiger?
"
,,
3,2," 100 grand. Pretty good, huh?
"
,,
3,2,"Sheesh. He's been in LA
"
,,
3,2,"how long? Unbelievable.
"
,,
3,2,"You know he actually called the main
"
,,
3,2,"character John Everyman? Come on.
"
,,
3,2,"Well, good for him.
"
,,
3,2,"Keanu Reeves. Wow.
"
,,
3,2,"I don't usually gush, so forgive me, but when
"
,,
3,2,"I was writing Coastguard... Oh, I'm a writer.
"
,,
3,2,"When I was writing Coastguard,
"
,,
3,2,"I couldn't think of anyone other than...
"
,,
3,2," There's a woodpecker on your head.
"
,,
3,2," Yeah, he comes and goes.
"
,,
3,2,"Now back to ""Kids Say the Darndest Things"".
"
,,
3,2,"It's OK. Take your time. Then what happened?
"
,,
3,2,"He... said he would kill me
"
,,
3,2,"if I ever said anything.
"
,,
3,2," Do you remember what he looked like?
"
,,
3,2," Yeah. He had a scar on his arm
"
,,
3,2,"and he had a big, stupid, doo-doo head.
"
,,
3,2,"A big, stupid, doo-doo head!
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, honestly, the things
"
,,
3,2,"these children come up with.
"
,,
3,2,"If you have a child you'd like to exploit to get
"
,,
3,2,"a trip to LA, have them try out for our show.
"
,,
3,2,"Next auditions in New York
"
,,
3,2,"and Quahog, Rhode Island.
"
,,
3,2," Maybe Stewie could get on that show.
"
,,
3,2," You must be shrooming.
"
,,
3,2,"Yeah! We can get a free trip
"
,,
3,2,"to LA and see Brian.
"
,,
3,2,"Jeez, I haven't been to California
"
,,
3,2,"since I lived with my other family.
"
,,
3,2,"Guys, I just got invited to a party
"
,,
3,2,"at Sharon Tate's house!
"
,,
3,2,"You guys can come, but you gotta
"
,,
3,2,"promise not to embarrass me.
"
,,
3,2,"Talk! I know you've been plotting
"
,,
3,2,"to foil my plans of world domination.
"
,,
3,2,"Who are you working for?
"
,,
3,2,"The Libyans? The French?
"
,,
3,2,"Very well. If torture won't work,
"
,,
3,2,"perhaps a little tenderness will.
"
,,
3,2,"Mm, I like your taste in women. Yes, she and I
"
,,
3,2,"are going to have a good time together.
"
,,
3,2,"Yes, you like this, don't you?
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, God. Look at me having sex
"
,,
3,2,"with a pig. I've become my father.
"
,,
3,2,"Stewie, let's get your sailor suit.
"
,,
3,2,"You gotta look cute
"
,,
3,2,"to audition for national TV.
"
,,
3,2,"Lois, I told you. There's no way...
"
,,
3,2,"National TV, you say? Coast to coast?
"
,,
3,2,"That could be the ideal place to unleash my
"
,,
3,2,"hypnosis device on the unsuspecting public.
"
,,
3,2,"I always loved this little sailor suit.
"
,,
3,2,"Or we could do nice corduroys and a sweater.
"
,,
3,2,"Or you could make yourself useful
"
,,
3,2,"and wipe my button - circular motion.
"
,,
3,2,"And don't you look at me!
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, my God. That's Michael Eisner.
"
,,
3,2,"I'll take it from here, Julio.
"
,,
3,2,"Here you go, Mr Eisner. It's been Brian-ised.
"
,,
3,2,"You might notice that new-script smell.
"
,,
3,2,"Every car I hand-wash
"
,,
3,2,"comes with a smile, an air freshener,
"
,,
3,2,"and a copy of my coming-of-age
"
,,
3,2,"teen comedy set in Wisconsin.
"
,,
3,2," What's your name?
"
,,
3,2," Brian.
"

3,2,"Let's see. There we go.
"
,,
3,2,"Brian.
"
,,
3,2,"See you at Disneyland. Bring money.
"
,,
3,2,"Look. It's Tom Tucker from the news.
"
,,
3,2,"And that must be his son.
"
,,
3,2," Oh, my.
"
,,
3,2," I feel bad staring without having got a ticket.
"
,,
3,2,"How can I follow that act?
"
,,
3,2,"Bite the head off a chicken?
"
,,
3,2," Dad, they're staring at me.
"
,,
3,2," They're just jealous.
"
,,
3,2," You're next.
"
,,
3,2," Wait. We were next.
"
,,
3,2,"Hey! Hey! Don't walk away from me! Hey!
"
,,
3,2,"You know what we'll do? We'll get
"
,,
3,2,"the video camera and make our own show.
"
,,
3,2," I don't wanna.
"
,,
3,2," Yes, you do. You do because it's normal.
"
,,
3,2,"Tell us, Stewie. What job does a mommy do?
"
,,
3,2,"Interesting question.
"
,,
3,2,"More to the point, how does one define ""job""
"
,,
3,2,"without branding oneself with useless
"
,,
3,2,"labels?
"
,,
3,2,"I'm sorry. I'm afraid I answered
"
,,
3,2,"your question with another question.
"
,,
3,2,"Um... How old do you think Daddy is?
"
,,
3,2,"Oh. I mean, Daddy's old. I think he's seven.
"
,,
3,2,"That's it. That's what you want to hear.
"
,,
3,2,"Yes, jump through the hoop.
"
,,
3,2,"Daddy's feet smell.
"
,,
3,2,"Jackasses.
"
,,
3,2,"Mr and Mrs Griffin, he's adorable.
"
,,
3,2,"Congratulations.
"
,,
3,2,"Stewie's gonna be on the show.
"
,,
3,2,"Did you hear that? We're going to Hollywood,
"
,,
3,2,"where people are sexy and clever
"
,,
3,2,"and always say somethin' funny
"
,,
3,2,"before the commercial break.
"
,,
3,2,"Great. I always end up
"
,,
3,2,"sitting next to a damn baby.
"
,,
3,2,"What did you just say?
"
,,
3,2," Stewie, stop fussing.
"
,,
3,2," Not now, Lois.
"
,,
3,2,"Turn around. If you've got
"
,,
3,2,"something to say, say it to my face.
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, you can't hear me now? That's it.
"
,,
3,2,"I was going to watch the movie,
"
,,
3,2,"but forget it. You're now my bitch.
"
,,
3,2,"Wah! Wah!
"
,,
3,2,"My ears are popping
"
,,
3,2,"and there's no way to console me.
"
,,
3,2,"I'm hungry and possibly teething.
"
,,
3,2,"Maybe I'm wet. Who knows? I'm a baby.
"
,,
3,2,"Wah! Wah!
"
,,
3,2,"This is a message
"
,,
3,2,"for Brian. This is Jack Nicholson.
"
,,
3,2,"Listen, I read your script
"
,,
3,2,"and it just jumped right off the page.
"
,,
3,2,"I think it's something I'd be excited
"
,,
3,2,"to be a part of, so call my...
"
,,
3,2,"Listen, I'm just jackin'you. Me and my buddy
"
,,
3,2,"Phil just found your script at Starbucks.
"
,,
3,2," Tell him it sucks.
"
,,
3,2," Yeah, it sucks.
"
,,
3,2,"Give it up, loser, and don't put
"
,,
3,2,"your number on the cover, you stupid...
"
,,
3,2,"I'm hungry.
"
,,
3,2,"Jasper's residence.
"
,,
3,2," Who the hell is Jasper? Where's Brian?
"
,,
3,2," Peter? It's me. Jasper's my cousin.
"
,,
3,2,"I'm using his place. He's working
"
,,
3,2,"at Club Med. Are you on a cell?
"
,,
3,2," Yeah, we're in LA.
"
,,
3,2," What? W-What a terrific surprise.
"
,,
3,2," Brian, can we see you for dinner?
"
,,
3,2," Yeah, you're not too famous to see us?
"
,,
3,2,"Well, I was invited to the premiere
"
,,
3,2,"of the new, uh...
"
,,
3,2,"the new Val Kilmer picture,
"
,,
3,2,"but I'd rather take you out to dinner.
"
,,
3,2," How about Musso & Frank's at eight?
"
,,
3,2," OK. See ya later, Mr Big Shot...
"
,,
3,2,"Crap. I didn't push ""End"".
"
,,
3,2,"This is gonna cost me a fortune.
"
,,
3,2,"Brian! I'm back. Tell me everything.
"
,,
3,2,"I'm sitting, I'm hearing.
"
,,
3,2,"That's Ricardo. Ricardo, Brian.
"
,,
3,2,"He doesn't speak English. Can I? Mm-mm.
"
,,
3,2,"Catching up. OK, me first. I'm in love.
"
,,
3,2,"Ooh, too much dressing.
"
,,
3,2,"He's from the Philippines.
"
,,
3,2,"I know - I'm a rice queen.
"
,,
3,2," How's the writing thingy going?
"
,,
3,2," Terrible. I can't get my foot in the door.
"
,,
3,2,"I have somebody you have to meet.
"
,,
3,2,"He's a producer. He's great.
"
,,
3,2,"Really? Thanks. That'd be great.
"
,,
3,2," D'you like sex and the city?
"
,,
3,2," It's an OK show.
"
,,
3,2,"I wasn't talking about the show.
"
,,
3,2,"Ooh! I'm nasty.
"
,,
3,2,"Someone send me out to sea.
"
,,
3,2,"It says here this is the gutter
"
,,
3,2,"where the policeman fell over laughing
"
,,
3,2,"after Eddie Murphy said he was just
"
,,
3,2,"giving the transvestite a ride home.
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, I think that's me.
"
,,
3,2," Hello.
"
,,
3,2," Hey, Peter. It's Quagmire.
"
,,
3,2," Hey, Quagmire.
"
,,
3,2," Last night I had sex with a black chick.
"
,,
3,2,"Uh... uh... I gotta go.
"
,,
3,2," Sorry.
"
,,
3,2," What? All he said was ""black chick"".
"
,,
3,2,"I know, but your boyfriend looks like
"
,,
3,2,"one of your typical angry black guys.
"
,,
3,2,"Hey, we cool, G?
"
,,
3,2,"Yuh? Yuh? Yuh? All right.
"
,,
3,2,"Halle Berry would be perfect as the camp
"
,,
3,2,"counsellor all the kids wanna ""get with"".
"
,,
3,2,"Jasper was right. You're very talented.
"
,,
3,2,"I'm having a brainstorm.
"
,,
3,2,"Ever thought about directing?
"
,,
3,2," Just every waking hour!
"
,,
3,2," Well, I got this movie.
"
,,
3,2,"It's a low-budget movie,
"
,,
3,2,"but the script is solid.
"
,,
3,2,"My director quit and I need somebody who's
"
,,
3,2,"smart, ambitious and not addicted to meth.
"
,,
3,2,"Well, I am smart and ambitious!
"
,,
3,2," Seriously.
"
,,
3,2," I'm clean.
"
,,
3,2,"Musso & Frank's is famous.
"
,,
3,2,"See the bar over there?
"
,,
3,2," Great writers like Hemingway drank there.
"
,,
3,2," Where'd that guy who wrote Porky's drink?
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, man, when that fat broad grabbed
"
,,
3,2,"that kid's crank through the hole.
"
,,
3,2,"Where do they get their ideas?
"
,,
3,2,"You're the writer. You tell me.
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, boy. This is great. All that searching,
"
,,
3,2,"that emptiness I felt back home, gone.
"
,,
3,2," I've finally found my life's calling.
"
,,
3,2," How wonderful.
"
,,
3,2,"I've always found your writing
"
,,
3,2,"a little hackneyed and stilted,
"
,,
3,2,"but I guess that's why I'm not
"
,,
3,2,"workin' out here in Hollywood, huh?
"
,,
3,2," Oh, congratulations on all your success.
"
,,
3,2," Uh, thank you.
"
,,
3,2," Know what might be a thrill for you guys?
"
,,
3,2," Ooh! Eating a pebble!
"
,,
3,2,"Yes, but I was talking about
"
,,
3,2,"stopping by the set to see me in action.
"
,,
3,2," Brian, could we really?
"
,,
3,2," You do know somebody in the business.
"
,,
3,2,"I'm in the business too, you know.
"
,,
3,2,"I'm going to be on television.
"
,,
3,2," Great.
"
,,
3,2," And when I make my appearance,
"
,,
3,2," you'll all be talking about it the next day.
"
,,
3,2," Good luck with that.
"
,,
3,2,"""Good luck with that. "" Yutz.
"
,,
3,2," Hello. Peter Griffin?
"
,,
3,2," You're in him.
"
,,
3,2,"Are you happy with
"
,,
3,2,"your long-distance service?
"
,,
3,2,"Yes, and I'm tired of you people
"
,,
3,2,"always calling during dinner.
"
,,
3,2," Give me your supervisor.
"
,,
3,2," Hold, please.
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, Peter, I love this song.
"
,,
3,2,"Open your mouth.
"
,,
3,2,"Brian. Right on time. I like that. Come in.
"
,,
3,2,"So, ready to shoot your first scene?
"
,,
3,2," Sure. Where's the set?
"
,,
3,2," Second door on your left.
"
,,
3,2," So, this is a shampoo commercial, right?
"
,,
3,2," Do I have to sleep with the dog in this one?
"
,,
3,2,"Can someone fluff Paul?
"
,,
3,2,"He's got a windsock thing goin' on.
"
,,
3,2,"So, this is a shampoo commercial, right?
"
,,
3,2,"Zack, I'm sorry.
"
,,
3,2,"There's just no way I can do this.
"
,,
3,2,"I've been around.
"
,,
3,2,"I've licked my share of peanut butter.
"
,,
3,2,"But I think you need
"
,,
3,2,"to find yourself a new director.
"
,,
3,2," Are you sure?
"
,,
3,2," I just can't do this.
"
,,
3,2,"Is this any more degrading than
"
,,
3,2,"washing cars? Here you can be creative.
"
,,
3,2,"I wanna make this perfectly clear. There is
"
,,
3,2,"absolutely no way I would consider doing it.
"
,,
3,2," Unless I saw a script first.
"
,,
3,2," Of course.
"
,,
3,2," This isn't bad.
"
,,
3,2," It's like Bang the Drum Slowly,
"
,,
3,2,"except the drum's a chick.
"
,,
3,2,"Peter, slow down. Brian said
"
,,
3,2,"he was gonna be on the set all day.
"
,,
3,2,"""On the set""! Listen to me. Two days in
"
,,
3,2,"Hollywood and I sound like a contract player.
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, crap. The LAPD.
"
,,
3,2,"Argh! Ow! Argh! Ow!
"
,,
3,2,"Come on, Peter. I wanna save some tape
"
,,
3,2,"for the Hollywood sign.
"
,,
3,2," OK. Hey, thanks a lot, you guys.
"
,,
3,2," Our pleasure. Have a nice vacation, sir.
"
,,
3,2,"Ooh!
"
,,
3,2,"Yes... yes... yes...
"
,,
3,2,"Cut. OK, nice take, Jenna, but let's try
"
,,
3,2,"giving the lines a little subtext this time.
"
,,
3,2,"Your husband's always away on business
"
,,
3,2,"and you feel isolated and unloved,
"
,,
3,2,"so you begin to think maybe
"
,,
3,2,"you should go back to graduate school.
"
,,
3,2,"That's when you notice
"
,,
3,2,"the cable man has no pants on.
"
,,
3,2,"Wow, a real movie set.
"
,,
3,2,"Hey, this house looks kinda familiar.
"
,,
3,2,"I'll bet Samuel L Jackson is here.
"
,,
3,2,"He's in everything. There's Brian!
"
,,
3,2,"All right, Samuel, when you lay her down,
"
,,
3,2,"I want you to enter from... Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,2," Hey, you guys.
"
,,
3,2," Hey, Brian. Can I be in the movie?
"
,,
3,2,"The Jacuzzi girl didn't show. How long
"
,,
3,2,"can you hold your breath under water?
"
,,
3,2," Real long. One time at Hatch Pond...
"
,,
3,2," No, absolutely not. You gotta leave.
"
,,
3,2," Get these people out.
"
,,
3,2," Now you're a director, we embarrass you?
"
,,
3,2," No, no... I mean, yes.
"
,,
3,2," Does anyone else smell Astroglide?
"
,,
3,2,"You're gonna look so handsome.
"
,,
3,2,"Look at these crow's-feet. God. You stay up
"
,,
3,2,"past 7.30 and you pay for it in the morning.
"
,,
3,2," Who the hell does Brian think he is?
"
,,
3,2," Maybe he thought we'd get in the way.
"
,,
3,2,"It's not the first time
"
,,
3,2,"you've disrupted a performance.
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, jeez. Oh, God. I didn't see it.
"
,,
3,2,"It jumped right out in front of my car.
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, I am so sorry.
"
,,
3,2,"We just have to face it. Brian's a Hollywood
"
,,
3,2,"director, and we're small-town people.
"
,,
3,2," All right, one more. Uh, Rob Lowe?
"
,,
3,2," Straight.
"
,,
3,2," No!
"
,,
3,2," Yes.
"
,,
3,2," Stop.
"
,,
3,2," Ho-hum.
"
,,
3,2," Pull over.
"
,,
3,2," Absolutely.
"
,,
3,2," Oh, well, he hides it well.
"
,,
3,2," He wishes.
"
,,
3,2,"Stewie. That's a funny name. Stewie.
"
,,
3,2,"It's like stew, only with an ""ie!"" at the end.
"
,,
3,2," Hm.
"
,,
3,2," I meant it's funny, Stewie.
"
,,
3,2,"I had an uncle named Stewie,
"
,,
3,2,"and he used to sell bicycles.
"
,,
3,2,"Aren't you supposed to be
"
,,
3,2,"asking me a question?
"
,,
3,2,"What do you think candies are made out of?
"
,,
3,2,"Sunshine and farts. What a silly question.
"
,,
3,2,"I love candy. When I was a little boy
"
,,
3,2,"we would play stickball.
"
,,
3,2,"No, no, I'll wait. Oh, you finished?
"
,,
3,2,"Sorry. I thought the name of the show
"
,,
3,2,"was Kids Say the Darndest Things,
"
,,
3,2,"not Old Black Comedians
"
,,
3,2,"Never Shut the Hell Up.
"
,,
3,2," Ask me what I want to be when I grow up.
"
,,
3,2," And we also used to play buck-buck.
"
,,
3,2,"Enough of your blether. Good evening, world.
"
,,
3,2,"From this moment on, I will be your...
"
,,
3,2,"What you got there?
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, you're gonna go skiing now?
"
,,
3,2,"Give that back. They're of no use to you.
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, I'm going down the mountain.
"
,,
3,2,"Coo-coo-cachoo.
"
,,
3,2,"No! Don't listen to him.
"
,,
3,2,"That's not funny. That's just saying
"
,,
3,2,"what happens when you go skiing.
"
,,
3,2,"Here I go, down the slope.
"
,,
3,2,"Ooh, I'm goin' zip-zop, zooba-de-bop.
"
,,
3,2,"Stop it. Stop applauding him.
"
,,
3,2,"He's not even using real words any more.
"
,,
3,2,"We'll be back with a girl from Atlanta
"
,,
3,2,"who skips rope with her sister's pigtails.
"
,,
3,2,"Coo-coo!
"
,,
3,2," No, my segment's not over!
"
,,
3,2," Come on, you like to jump rope, don't ya?
"
,,
3,2," I like jump rope.
"
,,
3,2," So you're gonna sit here and enjoy it.
"
,,
3,2,"I'm gonna sit here and enjoy it.
"
,,
3,2,"And I like pudding.
"
,,
3,2,"And Ghost Dad was the best movie
"
,,
3,2,"I've seen since Leonard Part 6.
"
,,
3,2," Good news.
"
,,
3,2," What? More people I love think I'm a jerk?
"
,,
3,2,"You're more than that, Mr ""Nominated
"
,,
3,2,"for an Adult Movie Award for Director"".
"
,,
3,2," A Woody? I'm up for a Woody?
"
,,
3,2," Call your family. They'll be proud of you.
"
,,
3,2,"I'd rather they think I'm a jerk
"
,,
3,2,"than a smut pedlar.
"
,,
3,2,"They'll love you even if you made
"
,,
3,2,"a couple of crappy movies.
"
,,
3,2,"Blythe Danner still loves Gwyneth Paltrow.
"
,,
3,2,"Oops! Score one for me.

"
,,
3,2,"I was asked to star in a porno, but I couldn't
"
,,
3,2,"cos most of my body's less than 18 years old.
"
,,
3,2," I used to guest-host The Tonight Show.
"
,,
3,2," Oh, yeah. What was that, 30 years ago?
"
,,
3,2,"Your mike isn't plugged in.

3,2,"but the only thing I'm missing is my family.
"
,,
3,2,"How could I have become involved

3,2," Lois, the case is already over.
"
,,
3,2,"Who did this to you?!
"
,,
3,2,"In all my research,
"
,,
3,2,"I've never seen a virus reproduce so fast.
"
,,
3,2,"Everyone I told about the file is dead.
"
,,
3,2,"What do you mean, ""Cut the blue wire""?
"
,,
3,2,"They're all blue.
"
,,
3,2,"Face it. He's never coming out of that coma.
"
,,
3,2,"Aaaargh!
"
,,
3,2,"Brian's gone to Los Angeles
"
,,
3,2,"to find himself.
"
,,
3,2,"""It seems today that all you see
"
,,
3,2,"""Is violence in movies and sex on TV
"
,,
3,2,"""But where are those
"
,,
3,2,"good old-fashioned values
"
,,
3,2,"""On which we used to rely?
"
,,
3,2,"""Lucky there's a family guy
"
,,
3,2,"""Lucky there's a man who positively can do
"
,,
3,2,"all the things that make us
"
,,
3,2,"""Laugh and cry
"
,,
3,2,"""He's a family guy
"
,,
3,2,"Don't throw out Brian's things.
"
,,
3,2,"He won't be in LA for ever.
"
,,
3,2,"He just needs to find himself.
"
,,
3,2,"He's not coming back, Lois.
"
,,
3,2,"He just walked out on us.
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, boy, did we have some good times.
"
,,
3,2,"Here it comes, buddy.
"
,,
3,2,"Argh! Oh, God! Oh, God!
"
,,
3,2,"Argh! Ow!
"
,,
3,2,"What are the odds? Argh!
"
,,
3,2,"If he does come back,
"
,,
3,2,"I want everything to be how he left it.
"
,,
3,2,"Easy! Massage the scalp.
"
,,
3,2,"You're washing a baby's hair, not
"
,,
3,2,"scrubbing vomit off your Christmas dress.
"
,,
3,2," We got a letter from Brian.
"
,,
3,2," Tell him I'm not here.
"
,,
3,2," Let me see.
"
,,
3,2," Argh! Argh!
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.
"
,,
3,2,"There. All better?
"
,,
3,2,"You are some piece of work, lady.
"
,,
3,2,"If you... Actually, yes, it is.
"
,,
3,2,"""Greetings from California.
"
,,
3,2,"I've been very busy. ""
"
,,
3,2,"""Having a great time trying
"
,,
3,2,"to make it as a writer in LA.""
"
,,
3,2,"""It's as easy as everyone thinks it is. ""
"
,,
3,2,"""I've been working the room
"
,,
3,2,"at a lot of Hollywood parties. "" Oh!
"
,,
3,2,"Bobby! Loved you in Raging Bull.
"
,,
3,2,"Hey, Jodie, how's the baby?
"
,,
3,2,"All right.
"
,,
3,2,"I need more cheese puffs. Oprah's off the
"
,,
3,2,"wagon. No toothpicks. She'll hurt herself.
"
,,
3,2,"Did you hear about Jason?
"
,,
3,2,"Paramount bought his script.
"
,,
3,2," They bought Death Spares Not the Tiger?
"
,,
3,2," 100 grand. Pretty good, huh?
"
,,
3,2,"Sheesh. He's been in LA
"
,,
3,2,"how long? Unbelievable.
"
,,
3,2,"You know he actually called the main
"
,,
3,2,"character John Everyman? Come on.
"
,,
3,2,"Well, good for him.
"
,,
3,2,"Keanu Reeves. Wow.
"
,,
3,2,"I don't usually gush, so forgive me, but when
"
,,
3,2,"I was writing Coastguard... Oh, I'm a writer.
"
,,
3,2,"When I was writing Coastguard,
"
,,
3,2,"I couldn't think of anyone other than...
"
,,
3,2," There's a woodpecker on your head.
"
,,
3,2," Yeah, he comes and goes.
"
,,
3,2,"Now back to ""Kids Say the Darndest Things"".
"
,,
3,2,"It's OK. Take your time. Then what happened?
"
,,
3,2,"He... said he would kill me
"
,,
3,2,"if I ever said anything.
"
,,
3,2," Do you remember what he looked like?
"
,,
3,2," Yeah. He had a scar on his arm
"
,,
3,2,"and he had a big, stupid, doo-doo head.
"
,,
3,2,"A big, stupid, doo-doo head!
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, honestly, the things
"
,,
3,2,"these children come up with.
"
,,
3,2,"If you have a child you'd like to exploit to get
"
,,
3,2,"a trip to LA, have them try out for our show.
"
,,
3,2,"Next auditions in New York
"
,,
3,2,"and Quahog, Rhode Island.
"
,,
3,2," Maybe Stewie could get on that show.
"
,,
3,2," You must be shrooming.
"
,,
3,2,"Yeah! We can get a free trip
"
,,
3,2,"to LA and see Brian.
"
,,
3,2,"Jeez, I haven't been to California
"
,,
3,2,"since I lived with my other family.
"
,,
3,2,"Guys, I just got invited to a party
"
,,
3,2,"at Sharon Tate's house!
"
,,
3,2,"You guys can come, but you gotta
"
,,
3,2,"promise not to embarrass me.
"
,,
3,2,"Talk! I know you've been plotting
"
,,
3,2,"to foil my plans of world domination.
"
,,
3,2,"Who are you working for?
"
,,
3,2,"The Libyans? The French?
"
,,
3,2,"Very well. If torture won't work,
"
,,
3,2,"perhaps a little tenderness will.
"
,,
3,2,"Mm, I like your taste in women. Yes, she and I
"
,,
3,2,"are going to have a good time together.
"
,,
3,2,"Yes, you like this, don't you?
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, God. Look at me having sex
"
,,
3,2,"with a pig. I've become my father.
"
,,
3,2,"Stewie, let's get your sailor suit.
"
,,
3,2,"You gotta look cute
"
,,
3,2,"to audition for national TV.
"
,,
3,2,"Lois, I told you. There's no way...
"
,,
3,2,"National TV, you say? Coast to coast?
"
,,
3,2,"That could be the ideal place to unleash my
"
,,
3,2,"hypnosis device on the unsuspecting public.
"
,,
3,2,"I always loved this little sailor suit.
"
,,
3,2,"Or we could do nice corduroys and a sweater.
"
,,
3,2,"Or you could make yourself useful
"
,,
3,2,"and wipe my button - circular motion.
"
,,
3,2,"And don't you look at me!
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, my God. That's Michael Eisner.
"
,,
3,2,"I'll take it from here, Julio.
"
,,
3,2,"Here you go, Mr Eisner. It's been Brian-ised.
"
,,
3,2,"You might notice that new-script smell.
"
,,
3,2,"Every car I hand-wash
"
,,
3,2,"comes with a smile, an air freshener,
"
,,
3,2,"and a copy of my coming-of-age
"
,,
3,2,"teen comedy set in Wisconsin.
"
,,
3,2," What's your name?
"
,,
3,2," Brian.
"
,,
3,2,"Let's see. There we go.
"
,,
3,2,"Brian.
"
,,
3,2,"See you at Disneyland. Bring money.
"
,,
3,2,"Look. It's Tom Tucker from the news.
"
,,
3,2,"And that must be his son.
"
,,
3,2," Oh, my.
"
,,
3,2," I feel bad staring without having got a ticket.
"
,,
3,2,"How can I follow that act?
"
,,
3,2,"Bite the head off a chicken?
"
,,
3,2," Dad, they're staring at me.
"
,,
3,2," They're just jealous.
"
,,
3,2," You're next.
"
,,
3,2," Wait. We were next.
"
,,
3,2,"Hey! Hey! Don't walk away from me! Hey!
"
,,
3,2,"You know what we'll do? We'll get
"
,,
3,2,"the video camera and make our own show.
"
,,
3,2," I don't wanna.
"
,,
3,2," Yes, you do. You do because it's normal.
"
,,
3,2,"Tell us, Stewie. What job does a mommy do?
"
,,
3,2,"Interesting question.
"
,,
3,2,"More to the point, how does one define ""job""
"
,,
3,2,"without branding oneself with useless
"
,,
3,2,"labels?
"
,,
3,2,"I'm sorry. I'm afraid I answered
"
,,
3,2,"your question with another question.
"
,,
3,2,"Um... How old do you think Daddy is?
"
,,
3,2,"Oh. I mean, Daddy's old. I think he's seven.
"
,,
3,2,"That's it. That's what you want to hear.
"
,,
3,2,"Yes, jump through the hoop.
"
,,
3,2,"Daddy's feet smell.
"
,,
3,2,"Jackasses.
"
,,
3,2,"Mr and Mrs Griffin, he's adorable.
"
,,
3,2,"Congratulations.
"
,,
3,2,"Stewie's gonna be on the show.
"
,,
3,2,"Did you hear that? We're going to Hollywood,
"
,,
3,2,"where people are sexy and clever
"
,,
3,2,"and always say somethin' funny
"
,,
3,2,"before the commercial break.
"
,,
3,2,"Great. I always end up
"
,,
3,2,"sitting next to a damn baby.
"
,,
3,2,"What did you just say?
"
,,
3,2," Stewie, stop fussing.
"
,,
3,2," Not now, Lois.
"
,,
3,2,"Turn around. If you've got
"
,,
3,2,"something to say, say it to my face.
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, you can't hear me now? That's it.
"
,,
3,2,"I was going to watch the movie,
"
,,
3,2,"but forget it. You're now my bitch.
"
,,
3,2,"Wah! Wah!
"
,,
3,2,"My ears are popping
"
,,
3,2,"and there's no way to console me.
"
,,
3,2,"I'm hungry and possibly teething.
"
,,
3,2,"Maybe I'm wet. Who knows? I'm a baby.
"
,,
3,2,"Wah! Wah!
"
,,
3,2,"This is a message
"
,,
3,2,"for Brian. This is Jack Nicholson.
"
,,
3,2,"Listen, I read your script
"
,,
3,2,"and it just jumped right off the page.
"
,,
3,2,"I think it's something I'd be excited
"
,,
3,2,"to be a part of, so call my...
"
,,
3,2,"Listen, I'm just jackin'you. Me and my buddy
"
,,
3,2,"Phil just found your script at Starbucks.
"
,,
3,2," Tell him it sucks.
"
,,
3,2," Yeah, it sucks.
"
,,
3,2,"Give it up, loser, and don't put
"
,,
3,2,"your number on the cover, you stupid...
"
,,
3,2,"I'm hungry.
"
,,
3,2,"Jasper's residence.
"
,,
3,2," Who the hell is Jasper? Where's Brian?
"
,,
3,2," Peter? It's me. Jasper's my cousin.
"
,,
3,2,"I'm using his place. He's working
"
,,
3,2,"at Club Med. Are you on a cell?
"
,,
3,2," Yeah, we're in LA.
"
,,
3,2," What? W-What a terrific surprise.
"
,,
3,2," Brian, can we see you for dinner?
"
,,
3,2," Yeah, you're not too famous to see us?
"
,,
3,2,"Well, I was invited to the premiere
"
,,
3,2,"of the new, uh...
"
,,
3,2,"the new Val Kilmer picture,
"
,,
3,2,"but I'd rather take you out to dinner.
"
,,
3,2," How about Musso & Frank's at eight?
"
,,
3,2," OK. See ya later, Mr Big Shot...
"
,,
3,2,"Crap. I didn't push ""End"".
"
,,
3,2,"This is gonna cost me a fortune.
"
,,
3,2,"Brian! I'm back. Tell me everything.
"
,,
3,2,"I'm sitting, I'm hearing.
"
,,
3,2,"That's Ricardo. Ricardo, Brian.
"
,,
3,2,"He doesn't speak English. Can I? Mm-mm.
"
,,
3,2,"Catching up. OK, me first. I'm in love.
"
,,
3,2,"Ooh, too much dressing.
"
,,
3,2,"He's from the Philippines.
"
,,
3,2,"I know - I'm a rice queen.
"
,,
3,2," How's the writing thingy going?
"
,,
3,2," Terrible. I can't get my foot in the door.
"
,,
3,2,"I have somebody you have to meet.
"
,,
3,2,"He's a producer. He's great.
"
,,
3,2,"Really? Thanks. That'd be great.
"
,,
3,2," D'you like sex and the city?
"
,,
3,2," It's an OK show.
"
,,
3,2,"I wasn't talking about the show.
"
,,
3,2,"Ooh! I'm nasty.
"
,,
3,2,"Someone send me out to sea.
"
,,
3,2,"It says here this is the gutter
"
,,
3,2,"where the policeman fell over laughing
"
,,
3,2,"after Eddie Murphy said he was just
"
,,
3,2,"giving the transvestite a ride home.
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, I think that's me.
"
,,
3,2," Hello.
"
,,
3,2," Hey, Peter. It's Quagmire.
"
,,
3,2," Hey, Quagmire.
"
,,
3,2," Last night I had sex with a black chick.
"
,,
3,2,"Uh... uh... I gotta go.
"
,,
3,2," Sorry.
"
,,
3,2," What? All he said was ""black chick"".
"
,,
3,2,"I know, but your boyfriend looks like
"
,,
3,2,"one of your typical angry black guys.
"
,,
3,2,"Hey, we cool, G?
"
,,
3,2,"Yuh? Yuh? Yuh? All right.
"
,,
3,2,"Halle Berry would be perfect as the camp
"
,,
3,2,"counsellor all the kids wanna ""get with"".
"
,,
3,2,"Jasper was right. You're very talented.
"
,,
3,2,"I'm having a brainstorm.
"
,,
3,2,"Ever thought about directing?
"
,,
3,2," Just every waking hour!
"
,,
3,2," Well, I got this movie.
"
,,
3,2,"It's a low-budget movie,
"
,,
3,2,"but the script is solid.
"
,,
3,2,"My director quit and I need somebody who's
"
,,
3,2,"smart, ambitious and not addicted to meth.
"
,,
3,2,"Well, I am smart and ambitious!
"
,,
3,2," Seriously.
"
,,
3,2," I'm clean.
"
,,
3,2,"Musso & Frank's is famous.
"
,,
3,2,"See the bar over there?
"
,,
3,2," Great writers like Hemingway drank there.
"
,,
3,2," Where'd that guy who wrote Porky's drink?
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, man, when that fat broad grabbed
"
,,
3,2,"that kid's crank through the hole.
"
,,
3,2,"Where do they get their ideas?
"
,,
3,2,"You're the writer. You tell me.
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, boy. This is great. All that searching,
"
,,
3,2,"that emptiness I felt back home, gone.
"
,,
3,2," I've finally found my life's calling.
"
,,
3,2," How wonderful.
"
,,
3,2,"I've always found your writing
"
,,
3,2,"a little hackneyed and stilted,
"
,,
3,2,"but I guess that's why I'm not
"
,,
3,2,"workin' out here in Hollywood, huh?
"
,,
3,2," Oh, congratulations on all your success.
"
,,
3,2," Uh, thank you.
"
,,
3,2," Know what might be a thrill for you guys?
"
,,
3,2," Ooh! Eating a pebble!
"
,,
3,2,"Yes, but I was talking about
"
,,
3,2,"stopping by the set to see me in action.
"
,,
3,2," Brian, could we really?
"
,,
3,2," You do know somebody in the business.
"
,,
3,2,"I'm in the business too, you know.
"
,,
3,2,"I'm going to be on television.
"
,,
3,2," Great.
"
,,
3,2," And when I make my appearance,
"
,,
3,2," you'll all be talking about it the next day.
"
,,
3,2," Good luck with that.
"
,,
3,2,"""Good luck with that. "" Yutz.
"
,,
3,2," Hello. Peter Griffin?
"
,,
3,2," You're in him.
"
,,
3,2,"Are you happy with
"
,,
3,2,"your long-distance service?
"
,,
3,2,"Yes, and I'm tired of you people
"
,,
3,2,"always calling during dinner.
"
,,
3,2," Give me your supervisor.
"
,,
3,2," Hold, please.
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, Peter, I love this song.
"
,,
3,2,"Open your mouth.
"
,,
3,2,"Brian. Right on time. I like that. Come in.
"
,,
3,2,"So, ready to shoot your first scene?
"
,,
3,2," Sure. Where's the set?
"
,,
3,2," Second door on your left.
"
,,
3,2," So, this is a shampoo commercial, right?
"
,,
3,2," Do I have to sleep with the dog in this one?
"
,,
3,2,"Can someone fluff Paul?
"
,,
3,2,"He's got a windsock thing goin' on.
"
,,
3,2,"So, this is a shampoo commercial, right?
"
,,
3,2,"Zack, I'm sorry.
"
,,
3,2,"There's just no way I can do this.
"
,,
3,2,"I've been around.
"
,,
3,2,"I've licked my share of peanut butter.
"
,,
3,2,"But I think you need
"
,,
3,2,"to find yourself a new director.
"
,,
3,2," Are you sure?
"
,,
3,2," I just can't do this.
"
,,
3,2,"Is this any more degrading than
"
,,
3,2,"washing cars? Here you can be creative.
"
,,
3,2,"I wanna make this perfectly clear. There is
"
,,
3,2,"absolutely no way I would consider doing it.
"
,,
3,2," Unless I saw a script first.
"
,,
3,2," Of course.
"
,,
3,2," This isn't bad.
"
,,
3,2," It's like Bang the Drum Slowly,
"
,,
3,2,"except the drum's a chick.
"
,,
3,2,"Peter, slow down. Brian said
"
,,
3,2,"he was gonna be on the set all day.
"
,,
3,2,"""On the set""! Listen to me. Two days in
"
,,
3,2,"Hollywood and I sound like a contract player.
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, crap. The LAPD.
"
,,
3,2,"Argh! Ow! Argh! Ow!
"
,,
3,2,"Come on, Peter. I wanna save some tape
"
,,
3,2,"for the Hollywood sign.
"
,,
3,2," OK. Hey, thanks a lot, you guys.
"
,,
3,2," Our pleasure. Have a nice vacation, sir.
"
,,
3,2,"Ooh!
"
,,
3,2,"Yes... yes... yes...
"
,,
3,2,"Cut. OK, nice take, Jenna, but let's try
"
,,
3,2,"giving the lines a little subtext this time.
"
,,
3,2,"Your husband's always away on business
"
,,
3,2,"and you feel isolated and unloved,
"
,,
3,2,"so you begin to think maybe
"
,,
3,2,"you should go back to graduate school.
"
,,
3,2,"That's when you notice
"
,,
3,2,"the cable man has no pants on.
"
,,
3,2,"Wow, a real movie set.
"
,,
3,2,"Hey, this house looks kinda familiar.
"
,,
3,2,"I'll bet Samuel L Jackson is here.
"
,,
3,2,"He's in everything. There's Brian!
"
,,
3,2,"All right, Samuel, when you lay her down,
"
,,
3,2,"I want you to enter from... Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,2," Hey, you guys.
"
,,
3,2," Hey, Brian. Can I be in the movie?
"
,,
3,2,"The Jacuzzi girl didn't show. How long
"
,,
3,2,"can you hold your breath under water?
"
,,
3,2," Real long. One time at Hatch Pond...
"
,,
3,2," No, absolutely not. You gotta leave.
"
,,
3,2," Get these people out.
"
,,
3,2," Now you're a director, we embarrass you?
"
,,
3,2," No, no... I mean, yes.
"
,,
3,2," Does anyone else smell Astroglide?
"
,,
3,2,"You're gonna look so handsome.
"
,,
3,2,"Look at these crow's-feet. God. You stay up
"
,,
3,2,"past 7.30 and you pay for it in the morning.
"
,,
3,2," Who the hell does Brian think he is?
"
,,
3,2," Maybe he thought we'd get in the way.
"
,,
3,2,"It's not the first time
"
,,
3,2,"you've disrupted a performance.
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, jeez. Oh, God. I didn't see it.
"
,,
3,2,"It jumped right out in front of my car.
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, I am so sorry.
"
,,
3,2,"We just have to face it. Brian's a Hollywood
"
,,
3,2,"director, and we're small-town people.
"
,,
3,2," All right, one more. Uh, Rob Lowe?
"
,,
3,2," Straight.
"
,,
3,2," No!
"
,,
3,2," Yes.
"
,,
3,2," Stop.
"
,,
3,2," Ho-hum.
"
,,
3,2," Pull over.
"
,,
3,2," Absolutely.
"
,,
3,2," Oh, well, he hides it well.
"
,,
3,2," He wishes.
"
,,
3,2,"Stewie. That's a funny name. Stewie.
"
,,
3,2,"It's like stew, only with an ""ie!"" at the end.
"
,,
3,2," Hm.
"
,,
3,2," I meant it's funny, Stewie.
"
,,
3,2,"I had an uncle named Stewie,
"
,,
3,2,"and he used to sell bicycles.
"
,,
3,2,"Aren't you supposed to be
"
,,
3,2,"asking me a question?
"
,,
3,2,"What do you think candies are made out of?
"
,,
3,2,"Sunshine and farts. What a silly question.
"
,,
3,2,"I love candy. When I was a little boy
"
,,
3,2,"we would play stickball.
"
,,
3,2,"No, no, I'll wait. Oh, you finished?
"
,,
3,2,"Sorry. I thought the name of the show
"
,,
3,2,"was Kids Say the Darndest Things,
"
,,
3,2,"not Old Black Comedians
"
,,
3,2,"Never Shut the Hell Up.
"
,,
3,2," Ask me what I want to be when I grow up.
"
,,
3,2," And we also used to play buck-buck.
"
,,
3,2,"Enough of your blether. Good evening, world.
"
,,
3,2,"From this moment on, I will be your...
"
,,
3,2,"What you got there?
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, you're gonna go skiing now?
"
,,
3,2,"Give that back. They're of no use to you.
"
,,
3,2,"Oh, I'm going down the mountain.
"
,,
3,2,"Coo-coo-cachoo.
"
,,
3,2,"No! Don't listen to him.
"
,,
3,2,"That's not funny. That's just saying
"
,,
3,2,"what happens when you go skiing.
"
,,
3,2,"Here I go, down the slope.
"
,,
3,2,"Ooh, I'm goin' zip-zop, zooba-de-bop.
"
,,
3,2,"Stop it. Stop applauding him.
"
,,
3,2,"He's not even using real words any more.
"
,,
3,2,"We'll be back with a girl from Atlanta
"
,,
3,2,"who skips rope with her sister's pigtails.
"
,,
3,2,"Coo-coo!
"
,,
3,2," No, my segment's not over!
"
,,
3,2," Come on, you like to jump rope, don't ya?
"
,,
3,2," I like jump rope.
"
,,
3,2," So you're gonna sit here and enjoy it.
"
,,
3,2,"I'm gonna sit here and enjoy it.
"
,,
3,2,"And I like pudding.
"
,,
3,2,"And Ghost Dad was the best movie
"
,,
3,2,"I've seen since Leonard Part 6.
"
,,
3,2," Good news.
"
,,
3,2," What? More people I love think I'm a jerk?
"
,,
3,2,"You're more than that, Mr ""Nominated
"
,,
3,2,"for an Adult Movie Award for Director"".
"
,,
3,2," A Woody? I'm up for a Woody?
"
,,
3,2," Call your family. They'll be proud of you.
"
,,
3,2,"I'd rather they think I'm a jerk
"
,,
3,2,"than a smut pedlar.
"
,,
3,2,"They'll love you even if you made
"
,,
3,2,"a couple of crappy movies.
"
,,
3,2,"Blythe Danner still loves Gwyneth Paltrow.
"
,,
3,2,"Oops! Score one for me.

3,2," You've Got Male Genitalia.
"
,,
3,2,"I was asked to star in a porno, but I couldn't
"
,,
3,2,"cos most of my body's less than 18 years old.
"
,,
3,2," I used to guest-host The Tonight Show.
"
,,
3,2," Oh, yeah. What was that, 30 years ago?

3,2," I can't say I approve but... we love you.
"
,,
3,2,"If this is what makes you happy,
"
,,
3,2,"we support you.
"

"
,,
3,2,"you guys to find what was missing in my life,
"
,,
3,2,"but the only thing I'm missing is my family.
"
,,
3,2,"How could I have become involved

3,2,"And the award goes to...

"
,,
3,2," Oh... Peter!
"
,,
3,2," Good luck, buddy.
"
,,
3,2,"I've been barking up that tree for 17 years.
"

3,2,"Wow. That was a wonderful trip, and

3,3," You tell me.
"

3,3,"Louie left his house at 2.15

"

3,3," Hello?
"
,,
3,3," Mr Weed? I can't come to work today.
"
,,
3,3,"I was in a terrible plane crash. My entire
"

3,3,"family was killed and I am a vegetable.
"
,,
3,3,"I'll see you tomorrow.

"

3,3,"Please, Peter. Your excuses
"

"

"

"

3,3,"I'm the man! Yeah!

"
,,

3,3,"I'll trade you this baseball

"
,,
3,3," Sure.
"
,,
3,3," What did you learn?
"
,,
3,3,"We haven't done anything together like this
"
,,
3,3,"since we saw Mike Tyson get beat.
"
,,
3,3,"All right, Mike.
"
,,
3,3,"The word again is ""onomatopoeia"".
"
,,
3,3," Uh, C.
"
,,
3,3," I'm sorry. That's incorrect.
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, dang.
"
,,
3,3,"I'm so glad you talked us all
"
,,
3,3,"into playing hooky.
"
,,
3,3,"Me, too. Maybe we can get on TV if we take
"
,,
3,3,"our shirts off and run onto the field.
"
,,
3,3," I'm not taking my shirt off.
"
,,
3,3," There. Now they're old news.
"
,,
3,3," Peter!
"
,,
3,3," Go, Sox! Go...
"
,,
3,3,"Aaargh!
"
,,
3,3,"Hm.
"
,,
3,3," Peter?
"
,,
3,3," Oh... Hi, Mr Weed.
"
,,
3,3," It seems you've made a full recovery.
"
,,
3,3," Oh, yeah. Yeah.
"
,,
3,3,"That plane crash I told you about,
"
,,
3,3,"it turned out to be gas.
"
,,
3,3,"Aha! Liar. Tomorrow, my office, 9.30.
"
,,
3,3,"I'm tired of Mr Weed treating me
"
,,
3,3,"like a common doormat.
"
,,
3,3,"I want him to treat me like a deluxe one
"
,,
3,3,"from Pottery Barn with the fancy straw.
"
,,
3,3,"I don't care for Pottery Barn.
"
,,
3,3,"If you want Mr Weed to respect you,
"
,,
3,3,"you're gonna have to earn it.
"
,,
3,3,"Earn it...
"
,,
3,3," Why have you forsaken me?
"
,,
3,3," Mr Weed?
"
,,
3,3,"I heard you ran into my identical twin
"
,,
3,3,"brother at the ball game yesterday.
"
,,
3,3,"If you don't buy that,
"
,,
3,3,"sorry I was at the ball game.
"
,,
3,3,"Peter, I just received terrible news.
"
,,
3,3,"This company has been taken over
"
,,
3,3,"by a conglomerate.
"
,,
3,3,"After 23 years of faithful service,
"
,,
3,3,"I've been terminated!
"
,,
3,3,"Wow. The business world sure is funny.
"
,,
3,3,"What do you call it when a guy in middle
"
,,
3,3,"management moves to upper management?
"
,,
3,3," I don't know. What do you call it?
"
,,
3,3," A promotion.
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, thanks. Here's a memo.
"
,,
3,3,"Sometimes the business world's funny.
"
,,
3,3,"And so on behalf of
"
,,
3,3,"the El Dorado Cigarette Company,
"
,,
3,3,"I'd like to welcome you to our family.
"
,,
3,3,"I think you'll be very happy
"
,,
3,3,"with the changes we've made.
"
,,
3,3,"This is sweet! Why are you
"
,,
3,3,"putting a window in the factory?
"
,,
3,3,"So Aunt Bee has a place
"
,,
3,3,"to let her pies cool.
"
,,
3,3,"Hello, boys. Today's pie is cherry.
"
,,
3,3,"It'll be ready just in time for lunch.
"
,,
3,3,"Wow. These guys sure know
"
,,
3,3,"how to run a company.
"
,,
3,3,"Look how happy those morons are.
"
,,
3,3,"They'll never realise we're using toys
"
,,
3,3,"to get children addicted
"
,,
3,3,"to our company's cigarettes.
"
,,
3,3,"Good boy, Connor.
"
,,
3,3,"Pull.
"
,,
3,3,"Can't we eat? I'm so hungry,
"
,,
3,3,"I could ride a horse.
"
,,
3,3,"I don't get it.
"
,,
3,3,"I could ride it to the store, I guess.
"
,,
3,3,"I told you we're not starting without your
"
,,
3,3,"father. Dinner just isn't dinner without him.
"
,,
3,3,"Perhaps I could help simulate the
"
,,
3,3,"experience. Yum, yum, yum...
"
,,
3,3,"Hey, family, anyone in the mood for lobster?
"
,,
3,3,"Ow! Oh, God! One of them has my pupil!
"
,,
3,3,"Agh, agh, agh!
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, God! Agh! Agh!
"
,,
3,3,"Ah.
"
,,
3,3,"How can you afford lobster on your salary?
"
,,
3,3," I got a raise.
"
,,
3,3," What?!
"
,,
3,3,"The new owners gave everyone raises.
"
,,
3,3,"Even Kenneth, the badass mail clerk
"
,,
3,3,"with the heart of gold.
"
,,
3,3," Hi, Kenneth. Did I get any mail?
"
,,
3,3," No! If you come any closer, I'll slice ya!
"
,,
3,3,"OK, OK. Man, what a badass.
"
,,
3,3,"Yeah? That ""badass"" just gave
"
,,
3,3,"half his pay cheque to orphans.
"
,,
3,3,"Orphans with diseases.
"
,,
3,3,"And check out the new toys we're making.
"
,,
3,3,"Baby Smokes-A-Lot?
"
,,
3,3,"Tastes like happy.
"
,,
3,3,"Cool! That's imitatable.
"
,,
3,3,"What the hell? ""El Dorado Cigarettes""?
"
,,
3,3,"That's who bought your company?
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,3,"They're trying to corrupt our children!
"
,,
3,3,"Those bastards turned a whole generation
"
,,
3,3,"of Americans into smokers
"
,,
3,3,"with subliminal advertising.
"
,,
3,3," Timmy, where's Lassie?
"
,,
3,3," She's out in the orchard, Ma.
"
,,
3,3,"Peaches are coming
"
,,
3,3,"in mighty early this year.
"
,,
3,3,"Smoke.
"
,,
3,3,"You know what they say:
"
,,
3,3,"""Early peaches, long summer"".
"
,,
3,3,"Smoke.
"
,,
3,3,"What's that, Lassie?
"
,,
3,3,"Are ya smoking yet?
"
,,
3,3,"If kids see this doll,
"
,,
3,3,"they're gonna think smoking's OK.
"
,,
3,3,"You have to talk to these
"
,,
3,3,"new bosses in the morning.
"
,,
3,3,"Don't worry, Lois. I'll set 'em straight.
"
,,
3,3,"Just like I did with Chris.
"
,,
3,3," Dad, what's the blowhole for?
"
,,
3,3," I'll tell you what it's not for, son.
"
,,
3,3,"And when I do, you'll understand
"
,,
3,3,"why I can never go back to SeaWorld.
"
,,
3,3,"We need to talk. My wife says
"
,,
3,3,"you're trying to get kids to smoke.
"
,,
3,3," That's just not true.
"
,,
3,3," What about this toy?
"
,,
3,3,"It's just a doll with a cigarette.
"
,,
3,3,"Barbie has a Dream Car, but you don't see
"
,,
3,3,"eight-year-old kids driving. They're fun toys.
"
,,
3,3," Smoke.
"
,,
3,3," Not now, Jerry.
"
,,
3,3,"Trust me. The last thing we want
"
,,
3,3,"is to get kids to start smoking.
"
,,
3,3,"What about that graph on the wall that says
"
,,
3,3,"""The first thing we want
"
,,
3,3,"is to get kids to start smoking. ""
"
,,
3,3,"That's just something
"
,,
3,3,"my son made me in art class.
"
,,
3,3,"Huh. Then what about that poster that says
"
,,
3,3,"""The graph was not made in art class.
"
,,
3,3,"We really do want kids to start smoking. ""
"
,,
3,3,"We're a caring company.
"
,,
3,3,"I mean, would you really be the president
"
,,
3,3,"of a company that didn't care about kids?
"
,,
3,3," No. But I'm not the president.
"
,,
3,3," Yes, you are... if you want to be.
"
,,
3,3,"Ah.
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, wow. Imagine me, president.
"
,,
3,3,"I'll do it!
"
,,
3,3," How did it go?
"
,,
3,3," I'm not finished yet.
"
,,
3,3," Aren't you gonna ask me how it went?
"
,,
3,3," Did you talk to the executives?
"
,,
3,3,"Peter, answer me!
"
,,
3,3," I did. They made me president.
"
,,
3,3," Of the whole company?
"
,,
3,3,"All right, Dad!
"
,,
3,3,"You shoulda seen the way they treated me.
"
,,
3,3,"I've never gotten that respect before.
"
,,
3,3," Great work-out, Bobby.
"
,,
3,3," Up yours, sack-breath!
"
,,
3,3,"That's Mr Griffin.
"
,,
3,3,"Peter, why would they make you president?
"
,,
3,3,"Maybe it's because I can recite all
"
,,
3,3," That was just a loud yelping noise.
"
,,
3,3," Jeez, Lois. I thought you'd be proud of me.
"
,,
3,3,"The company finally thinks
"
,,
3,3,"I'm worth something.
"
,,
3,3,"Wait till you see all the perks we get.
"
,,
3,3,"Um... hi. Can I help you?
"
,,
3,3,"Some company hired me to stand next
"
,,
3,3,"to you all day, so you'd look better.
"
,,
3,3," That's ridiculous.
"
,,
3,3," Meg? Did you get less ugly?
"
,,
3,3,"Yeah!
"
,,
3,3," Surprise!
"
,,
3,3," Everything looks the same.
"
,,
3,3,"It looks the same.
"
,,
3,3,"But El Dorado Cigarettes coated the inside
"
,,
3,3,"of the house with a microfilm of Teflon,
"
,,
3,3,"so it's easy to clean.
"
,,
3,3,"Oh.
"
,,
3,3,"Maybe I shouldn't have had 'em do the floors.
"
,,
3,3,"I'm Nudes on Ice!
"
,,
3,3,"This is so exciting.
"
,,
3,3,"Your father's first day as president.
"
,,
3,3,"Good morning, First Family.
"
,,
3,3," Lois, what's in this coffee?
"
,,
3,3," Isn't it wonderful?
"
,,
3,3,"They sent Martha Stewart
"
,,
3,3,"to help me with the housework.
"
,,
3,3,"I take back all the bad things I said
"
,,
3,3,"about them. The coffee is delicious, Martha.
"
,,
3,3,"A little chicory perks up the taste
"
,,
3,3,"of roasted coffee beans. It's a good thing.
"
,,
3,3,"I think it's a crappy thing!
"
,,
3,3,"In fact, this is my last cigarette ever.
"
,,
3,3,"You make me sick being bought off
"
,,
3,3,"with a few lousy perks.
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, I beg to differ.
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, you don't need to park here, Mr Griffin.
"
,,
3,3,"You have an executive parking space now.
"
,,
3,3,"That looks exactly like my old space.
"
,,
3,3,"This one comes
"
,,
3,3,"with your own company suck-up.
"
,,
3,3," Morning. Nice day.
"
,,
3,3," It's a little cloudy.
"
,,
3,3,"Absolutely. One of the worst days
"
,,
3,3,"I've seen in years.
"
,,
3,3," Good news about the Yankees.
"
,,
3,3," I hate them.
"
,,
3,3,"Pack of cheaters, they are. I love your tie.
"
,,
3,3," I hate this tie.
"
,,
3,3," It's awful, it's gaudy, it's gotta go.
"
,,
3,3," And I hate myself.
"
,,
3,3," You make me sick, you fat sack of crap.
"
,,
3,3," I'm the president
"
,,
3,3," The best there is.
"
,,
3,3," But you just said you hated me.
"
,,
3,3," But... not you the president.
"
,,
3,3,"The you who said you hated you.
"
,,
3,3,"You, who love, hate, Yankees, clouds...
"
,,
3,3,"I'll have that fixed for you, sir.
"
,,
3,3,"Here's your new digs. Now get
"
,,
3,3,"to work, sport. We're counting on you.
"
,,
3,3,"Wow. My own office.
"
,,
3,3,"I guess I'd better get busy.
"
,,
3,3,"Agh!
"
,,
3,3,"Gentlemen, we have a problem.
"
,,
3,3,"There's an anti-smoking bill
"
,,
3,3,"that could put us out of business.
"
,,
3,3,"Yes. Apparently, causing cancer
"
,,
3,3,"is this year's ""hot button"".
"
,,
3,3,"We've tried everything
"
,,
3,3,"to get through to these politicians.
"
,,
3,3,"Harvard lawyers, lobbyists,
"
,,
3,3,"wisecracking leprechauns.
"
,,
3,3,"Excuse me. Do you have a dollar?
"
,,
3,3,"I'm a little short.
"
,,
3,3,"That's the problem.
"
,,
3,3,"They're idiots in Washington.
"
,,
3,3,"Instead of a smart guy, we should
"
,,
3,3,"send a moron they can relate to.
"
,,
3,3,"Where are we going to find someone
"
,,
3,3,"who's that stupid?
"
,,
3,3," Yeah. And not just stupid. Fat, too.
"
,,
3,3," That's exactly what we need.
"
,,
3,3,"Wait. Didn't we just make
"
,,
3,3,"a fat, stupid guy president?
"
,,
3,3,"You bet we did. Gentlemen,
"
,,
3,3,"our new tobacco lobbyist is... that guy!
"
,,
3,3,"So what's this big assignment
"
,,
3,3,"you got for me, chairman of the broad?
"
,,
3,3,"""Chairman of the broad"".
"
,,
3,3,"When did you become such a stitch?
"
,,
3,3,"Don't you remember? You gave me writers.
"
,,
3,3,"""I don't want to say you're rich,
"
,,
3,3,"but when you walk into a bank,
"
,,

3,3,"That wasn't funny.
"

3,3,"I thought you were Jewish.
"

"
,,
3,3," You're fired.
"
,,
3,3,"Here's the thing. Some troublemakers
"

3,3,"in Congress are trying to shut us down.
"
,,
3,3,"We need someone important like you
"
,,
3,3,"to go down to Washington
"
,,
3,3,"and help those bastards see
"
,,
3,3,"what fun-loving people
"
,,
3,3,"the tobacco industry's made of.
"
,,
3,3,"Washington? Sweet.
"
,,
3,3,"But I gotta warn you,
"
,,
3,3,"I've made some enemies on the Hill.
"
,,
3,3,"And that's when Clarence Thomas
"
,,
3,3,"forced me into his chambers
"
,,
3,3,"and showed me lewd pictures.
"
,,
3,3,"We have indisputable evidence
"
,,
3,3,"that not only have you never been
"
,,
3,3,"in the same room as Clarence Thomas,
"
,,
3,3,"you've never been in the same state.
"
,,
3,3,"How do you respond to that?
"
,,
3,3,"Bababooie! Bababooie!
"
,,
3,3,"Howard Stern's penis! Bababooie!
"
,,
3,3,"How long is Dad gonna be in Washington?
"
,,
3,3,"As long as it takes.
"
,,
3,3,"He's a very important man now.
"
,,
3,3,"He's the spokesman for his entire industry.
"

3,3,"Thank you, Martha.
"

3,3,"Brian, could you pass me the TV guide?
"
,,
3,3," Piss off!
"
,,
3,3," What?
"
,,
3,3,"I'm sorry. It just feels like for ever
"
,,
3,3,"since I've had a smoke.
"
,,
3,3,"I'm just a bit testy. Stop staring at my tail!
"
,,
3,3,"Mr Harrison? I see those government guys
"
,,
3,3,"you were telling me about.
"
,,
3,3,"I'll show 'em a good time
"

"

3,3," Oh, God. No, seriously. What's his name?
"
,,
3,3," Dick Armey.
"

3,3,"Oh. Oh, I just got it.
"
,,
3,3,"Hey. Hey, Armey. Hey, what's your
"
,,
3,3,"wife's name? Vagina Coastguard?
"
,,
3,3,"I'm kidding. Get in the car.
"
,,
3,3,"We're going to a skin bar.
"
,,
3,3," OK.
"
,,
3,3," Great.
"
,,
3,3,"That sounds good.
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, my God. I don't know what happened.
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, it's OK. It's OK, Senator.
"
,,
3,3,"This girl didn't have a family.
"
,,
3,3,"It'll be like she never existed.
"
,,
3,3,"Grab ahold of yourself.
"
,,
3,3,"You may have killed her when you shoved
"
,,
3,3,"all those dollar bills down her throat.
"
,,
3,3,"You may have killed her when you hit her
"
,,
3,3,"with the stool. I'm not a doctor.
"
,,
3,3,"But I'll tell you what didn't
"
,,
3,3,"kill her... Smoking.
"
,,
3,3,"You have our support.
"
,,
3,3,"Look, kids. Here's your father
"
,,
3,3,"in People magazine with Jim Carrey,
"
,,
3,3,"and they're both ""Sssmokin'!""
"
,,
3,3,"I loved that in Mask. ""Sssmokin'!""
"
,,
3,3,"""Sssmokin'!"" ""Sssmokin'!""
"
,,
3,3,"Do I have to listen
"
,,
3,3,"to this drivel 24 hours a day?!
"
,,
3,3,"But, hey, I guess anything's better
"
,,
3,3,"than looking at your smelly face!
"
,,
3,3," Mom!
"
,,
3,3," Honey, your face smells fine.
"
,,
3,3,"He doesn't mean it. It's the lack of nicotine.
"
,,
3,3,"Mom, the school janitor said
"
,,
3,3,"that Dad's working for the bad guys.
"
,,
3,3," He said it through a hole in his throat.
"
,,
3,3," That doesn't make him right.
"
,,
3,3,"If I had a hole in my throat,
"
,,
3,3,"I'd put pennies in it!
"
,,
3,3,"Your father's doing great work.
"
,,
3,3,"Life's never been better.
"
,,
3,3,"Yes. I, too, applaud the oaf
"
,,
3,3,"for finally showing initiative.
"
,,
3,3,"God knows it was years overdue.
"
,,
3,3,"You know who I saw at the market today?
"
,,
3,3,"Patty Croft. Oh, and she has gotten fat!
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, my God! Stewie, no!
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, God. What have I done?
"
,,
3,3,"I knew smoking was bad.
"
,,
3,3,"But I still sold my soul.
"
,,
3,3,"And for what? Martha Stewart?
"
,,
3,3,"Come on, kids.
"
,,
3,3,"We gotta put a stop to this. Now!
"
,,
3,3,"Finally.
"
,,
3,3,"Ah.
"
,,
3,3,"""They call me Bill
"
,,
3,3,"""Yes, they call me Bill

"
,,
3,3,"That cigarette company is evil.
"
,,
3,3," We can't be a part of this any more.
"
,,
3,3," This is the best job I ever had!
"
,,
3,3,"Since I became president, profits
"

3,3,"have been higher than Alyssa Milano.
"
,,
3,3," What kind of cheap shot... Joel!
"
,,
3,3," I'm suing. I'm suing. I'm on it. I'm on it.
"
,,
3,3," Mr Griffin, time for your speech.
"
,,
3,3," What about your son?
"
,,
3,3,"So Stewie had a puff.
"
,,
3,3,"He's old enough to make his own decisions.
"
,,
3,3,"For God's sakes, Lois, he's one.
"
,,
3,3,"Cut the umbilical cord.
"
,,
3,3,"Ladies and gentlemen of Congress, I am
"
,,
3,3,"here today to talk to you about smoking.
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, please, Peter, do the right thing.
"
,,
3,3,"I know a lot of you are already on my side.
"
,,
3,3,"And for you naysayers,
"
,,
3,3,"I have two strong words for you...
"
,,
3,3,"Come on! Come on!
"
,,
3,3," OK. OK, sure.
"
,,
3,3," All right. Why not?
"
,,
3,3,"Thank you, ladies and...
"
,,
3,3,"...and...

3,3,"Baby needs to suck ash!
"
,,
3,3,"Baby needs to suck ash!
"
,,
3,3,"Not ""ass"", you pervert.
"
,,
3,3,"Save it for the interns.
"
,,
3,3,"Is that a baby?
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, my God. That's Stewie. Lois was right.
"
,,
3,3,"Children under four shouldn't smoke.
"
,,
3,3,"I don't care about this job any more.
"
,,
3,3,"Cigarettes are bad!
"
,,
3,3,"Mr Griffin is right!
"
,,
3,3,"Smoking is a horrible vice!
"
,,
3,3,"It shortens life expectancy
"
,,
3,3,"and pollutes our air.
"
,,
3,3,"According to recent polls, air is good.
"
,,
3,3,"Cigarettes killed my father
"
,,
3,3,"and raped my mother!
"
,,
3,3,"I propose we send a message
"
,,
3,3,"to tobacco companies
"
,,
3,3,"by fining the El Dorado Cigarette Company
"
,,
3,3,"infinity billion dollars!
"
,,
3,3,"That's the spirit, Frank. But I think
"
,,
3,3,"a real number might be more effective.
"
,,
3,3,"All in favour of fining this evil tobacco
"
,,
3,3,"giant $100 million dollars say ""Aye"".
"
,,
3,3," Aye!
"
,,
3,3," But that'll bankrupt us!
"
,,
3,3,"You mean the way you've
"
,,
3,3,"morally bankrupted America?
"
,,
3,3,"Thanks for that zinger.
"
,,
3,3,"Give me a snappy line to go out on.
"
,,
3,3,"Actually, our lunch is here.
"

3,3,"Uh...
"
,,
3,3,"Well, that's my mama!
"

3,3,"Hi, I'm Peter Griffin.
"
,,
3,3,"We've had a lot of laughs tonight.
"
,,
3,3,"But I'll tell you what's not funny.
"
,,
3,3,"Killing strippers. Strippers are people, too.
"
,,
3,3,"Naked people who may be willing
"
,,
3,3,"to pleasure you for a price you negotiate.
"

3,3,"Besides, there's no need to kill 'em.

3,3,"Most of them are already dead inside.

"

3,3,"After 23 years of faithful service,
"

"

3,3,"I could ride it to the store, I guess.
"
,,
3,3,"I told you we're not starting without your
"

3,3,"father. Dinner just isn't dinner without him.
"
,,
3,3,"Perhaps I could help simulate the

"
,,
3,3,"Ow! Oh, God! One of them has my pupil!
"
,,
3,3,"Agh, agh, agh!
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, God! Agh! Agh!
"
,,
3,3,"Ah.
"
,,
3,3,"How can you afford lobster on your salary?
"
,,
3,3," I got a raise.
"
,,
3,3," What?!
"
,,
3,3,"The new owners gave everyone raises.
"
,,
3,3,"Even Kenneth, the badass mail clerk
"
,,
3,3,"with the heart of gold.
"
,,
3,3," Hi, Kenneth. Did I get any mail?
"
,,
3,3," No! If you come any closer, I'll slice ya!
"
,,
3,3,"OK, OK. Man, what a badass.
"
,,
3,3,"Yeah? That ""badass"" just gave
"
,,
3,3,"half his pay cheque to orphans.
"
,,
3,3,"Orphans with diseases.
"
,,
3,3,"And check out the new toys we're making.
"
,,
3,3,"Baby Smokes-A-Lot?
"
,,
3,3,"Tastes like happy.
"
,,
3,3,"Cool! That's imitatable.
"
,,
3,3,"What the hell? ""El Dorado Cigarettes""?
"
,,
3,3,"That's who bought your company?
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,3,"They're trying to corrupt our children!
"
,,
3,3,"Those bastards turned a whole generation
"
,,
3,3,"of Americans into smokers
"
,,
3,3,"with subliminal advertising.
"
,,
3,3," Timmy, where's Lassie?
"
,,
3,3," She's out in the orchard, Ma.
"
,,
3,3,"Peaches are coming
"
,,
3,3,"in mighty early this year.
"
,,
3,3,"Smoke.
"
,,
3,3,"You know what they say:
"
,,
3,3,"""Early peaches, long summer"".
"
,,
3,3,"Smoke.
"
,,
3,3,"What's that, Lassie?
"
,,
3,3,"Are ya smoking yet?
"
,,
3,3,"If kids see this doll,
"
,,
3,3,"they're gonna think smoking's OK.
"
,,
3,3,"You have to talk to these
"
,,
3,3,"new bosses in the morning.
"
,,
3,3,"Don't worry, Lois. I'll set 'em straight.
"
,,
3,3,"Just like I did with Chris.
"
,,
3,3," Dad, what's the blowhole for?
"
,,
3,3," I'll tell you what it's not for, son.
"
,,
3,3,"And when I do, you'll understand
"
,,
3,3,"why I can never go back to SeaWorld.
"
,,
3,3,"We need to talk. My wife says
"
,,
3,3,"you're trying to get kids to smoke.
"
,,
3,3," That's just not true.
"
,,
3,3," What about this toy?
"
,,
3,3,"It's just a doll with a cigarette.
"
,,
3,3,"Barbie has a Dream Car, but you don't see
"
,,
3,3,"eight-year-old kids driving. They're fun toys.
"
,,
3,3," Smoke.
"
,,
3,3," Not now, Jerry.
"
,,
3,3,"Trust me. The last thing we want
"
,,
3,3,"is to get kids to start smoking.
"
,,
3,3,"What about that graph on the wall that says
"
,,
3,3,"""The first thing we want
"
,,
3,3,"is to get kids to start smoking. ""
"
,,
3,3,"That's just something
"
,,
3,3,"my son made me in art class.
"
,,
3,3,"Huh. Then what about that poster that says
"
,,
3,3,"""The graph was not made in art class.
"
,,
3,3,"We really do want kids to start smoking. ""
"
,,
3,3,"We're a caring company.
"
,,
3,3,"I mean, would you really be the president
"
,,
3,3,"of a company that didn't care about kids?
"
,,
3,3," No. But I'm not the president.
"
,,
3,3," Yes, you are... if you want to be.
"
,,
3,3,"Ah.
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, wow. Imagine me, president.
"
,,
3,3,"I'll do it!
"
,,
3,3," How did it go?
"
,,
3,3," I'm not finished yet.
"
,,
3,3," Aren't you gonna ask me how it went?
"
,,
3,3," Did you talk to the executives?
"
,,
3,3,"Peter, answer me!
"
,,
3,3," I did. They made me president.
"
,,
3,3," Of the whole company?
"
,,
3,3,"All right, Dad!
"
,,
3,3,"You shoulda seen the way they treated me.
"
,,
3,3,"I've never gotten that respect before.
"
,,
3,3," Great work-out, Bobby.
"
,,
3,3," Up yours, sack-breath!
"
,,
3,3,"That's Mr Griffin.
"
,,
3,3,"Peter, why would they make you president?
"
,,
3,3,"Maybe it's because I can recite all
"
,,
3,3," That was just a loud yelping noise.
"
,,
3,3," Jeez, Lois. I thought you'd be proud of me.
"
,,
3,3,"The company finally thinks
"
,,
3,3,"I'm worth something.
"
,,
3,3,"Wait till you see all the perks we get.
"
,,
3,3,"Um... hi. Can I help you?
"
,,
3,3,"Some company hired me to stand next
"
,,
3,3,"to you all day, so you'd look better.
"
,,
3,3," That's ridiculous.
"
,,
3,3," Meg? Did you get less ugly?
"
,,
3,3,"Yeah!
"
,,
3,3," Surprise!
"
,,
3,3," Everything looks the same.
"
,,
3,3,"It looks the same.
"
,,
3,3,"But El Dorado Cigarettes coated the inside
"
,,
3,3,"of the house with a microfilm of Teflon,
"
,,
3,3,"so it's easy to clean.
"
,,
3,3,"Oh.
"
,,
3,3,"Maybe I shouldn't have had 'em do the floors.
"
,,
3,3,"I'm Nudes on Ice!
"
,,
3,3,"This is so exciting.
"
,,
3,3,"Your father's first day as president.
"
,,
3,3,"Good morning, First Family.
"
,,
3,3," Lois, what's in this coffee?
"
,,
3,3," Isn't it wonderful?
"
,,
3,3,"They sent Martha Stewart
"
,,
3,3,"to help me with the housework.
"
,,
3,3,"I take back all the bad things I said
"
,,
3,3,"about them. The coffee is delicious, Martha.
"
,,
3,3,"A little chicory perks up the taste
"
,,
3,3,"of roasted coffee beans. It's a good thing.
"
,,
3,3,"I think it's a crappy thing!
"
,,
3,3,"In fact, this is my last cigarette ever.
"
,,
3,3,"You make me sick being bought off
"
,,
3,3,"with a few lousy perks.
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, I beg to differ.
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, you don't need to park here, Mr Griffin.
"
,,
3,3,"You have an executive parking space now.
"
,,
3,3,"That looks exactly like my old space.
"
,,
3,3,"This one comes
"
,,
3,3,"with your own company suck-up.
"
,,
3,3," Morning. Nice day.
"
,,
3,3," It's a little cloudy.
"
,,
3,3,"Absolutely. One of the worst days
"
,,
3,3,"I've seen in years.
"
,,
3,3," Good news about the Yankees.
"
,,
3,3," I hate them.
"
,,
3,3,"Pack of cheaters, they are. I love your tie.
"
,,
3,3," I hate this tie.
"
,,
3,3," It's awful, it's gaudy, it's gotta go.
"
,,
3,3," And I hate myself.
"
,,
3,3," You make me sick, you fat sack of crap.
"
,,
3,3," I'm the president
"
,,
3,3," The best there is.
"
,,
3,3," But you just said you hated me.
"
,,
3,3," But... not you the president.
"
,,
3,3,"The you who said you hated you.
"
,,
3,3,"You, who love, hate, Yankees, clouds...
"
,,
3,3,"I'll have that fixed for you, sir.
"
,,
3,3,"Here's your new digs. Now get
"
,,
3,3,"to work, sport. We're counting on you.
"
,,
3,3,"Wow. My own office.
"
,,
3,3,"I guess I'd better get busy.
"
,,
3,3,"Agh!
"
,,
3,3,"Gentlemen, we have a problem.
"
,,
3,3,"There's an anti-smoking bill
"
,,
3,3,"that could put us out of business.
"
,,
3,3,"Yes. Apparently, causing cancer
"
,,
3,3,"is this year's ""hot button"".
"
,,
3,3,"We've tried everything
"
,,
3,3,"to get through to these politicians.
"
,,
3,3,"Harvard lawyers, lobbyists,
"
,,
3,3,"wisecracking leprechauns.
"
,,
3,3,"Excuse me. Do you have a dollar?
"
,,
3,3,"I'm a little short.
"
,,
3,3,"That's the problem.
"
,,
3,3,"They're idiots in Washington.
"
,,
3,3,"Instead of a smart guy, we should
"
,,
3,3,"send a moron they can relate to.
"
,,
3,3,"Where are we going to find someone
"
,,
3,3,"who's that stupid?
"
,,
3,3," Yeah. And not just stupid. Fat, too.
"
,,
3,3," That's exactly what we need.
"
,,
3,3,"Wait. Didn't we just make
"
,,
3,3,"a fat, stupid guy president?
"
,,
3,3,"You bet we did. Gentlemen,
"
,,
3,3,"our new tobacco lobbyist is... that guy!
"
,,
3,3,"So what's this big assignment
"
,,
3,3,"you got for me, chairman of the broad?
"
,,
3,3,"""Chairman of the broad"".
"
,,
3,3,"When did you become such a stitch?
"
,,
3,3,"Don't you remember? You gave me writers.
"
,,
3,3,"""I don't want to say you're rich,
"
,,
3,3,"but when you walk into a bank,
"
,,
3,3,"all the tellers go 'Whoopee!""'

,,
3,3,"That wasn't funny.
"
,,
3,3,"I thought you were Jewish.
"
,,
3,3," He's only half-Jewish.
"
,,
3,3," You're fired.
"
,,
3,3,"Here's the thing. Some troublemakers
"
,,
3,3,"in Congress are trying to shut us down.
"
,,
3,3,"We need someone important like you
"
,,
3,3,"to go down to Washington
"
,,
3,3,"and help those bastards see
"
,,
3,3,"what fun-loving people
"
,,
3,3,"the tobacco industry's made of.
"
,,
3,3,"Washington? Sweet.
"
,,
3,3,"But I gotta warn you,
"
,,
3,3,"I've made some enemies on the Hill.
"
,,
3,3,"And that's when Clarence Thomas
"
,,
3,3,"forced me into his chambers
"
,,
3,3,"and showed me lewd pictures.
"
,,
3,3,"We have indisputable evidence
"
,,
3,3,"that not only have you never been
"
,,
3,3,"in the same room as Clarence Thomas,
"
,,
3,3,"you've never been in the same state.
"
,,
3,3,"How do you respond to that?
"
,,
3,3,"Bababooie! Bababooie!
"
,,
3,3,"Howard Stern's penis! Bababooie!
"
,,
3,3,"How long is Dad gonna be in Washington?
"
,,
3,3,"As long as it takes.
"
,,
3,3,"He's a very important man now.
"
,,
3,3,"He's the spokesman for his entire industry.
"
,,
3,3,"Thank you, Martha.
"
,,
3,3,"Brian, could you pass me the TV guide?
"
,,
3,3," Piss off!
"
,,
3,3," What?
"
,,
3,3,"I'm sorry. It just feels like for ever
"
,,
3,3,"since I've had a smoke.
"
,,
3,3,"I'm just a bit testy. Stop staring at my tail!
"
,,
3,3,"Mr Harrison? I see those government guys
"
,,
3,3,"you were telling me about.
"
,,
3,3,"I'll show 'em a good time
"

"

3,3," Oh, God. No, seriously. What's his name?
"

3,3," Dick Armey.
"

3,3,"Oh. Oh, I just got it.
"
,,
3,3,"Hey. Hey, Armey. Hey, what's your
"

3,3,"wife's name? Vagina Coastguard?
"

3,3,"I'm kidding. Get in the car.
"

3,3,"We're going to a skin bar.
"

3,3," OK.
"

3,3," Great.
"

3,3,"That sounds good.
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, my God. I don't know what happened.
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, it's OK. It's OK, Senator.
"
,,
3,3,"This girl didn't have a family.
"
,,
3,3,"It'll be like she never existed.
"
,,
3,3,"Grab ahold of yourself.
"
,,
3,3,"You may have killed her when you shoved
"
,,
3,3,"all those dollar bills down her throat.
"
,,
3,3,"You may have killed her when you hit her
"
,,
3,3,"with the stool. I'm not a doctor.
"
,,
3,3,"But I'll tell you what didn't
"
,,
3,3,"kill her... Smoking.
"
,,
3,3,"You have our support.
"
,,
3,3,"Look, kids. Here's your father
"
,,
3,3,"in People magazine with Jim Carrey,
"
,,
3,3,"and they're both ""Sssmokin'!""
"
,,
3,3,"I loved that in Mask. ""Sssmokin'!""
"
,,
3,3,"""Sssmokin'!"" ""Sssmokin'!""
"
,,
3,3,"Do I have to listen
"
,,
3,3,"to this drivel 24 hours a day?!
"
,,
3,3,"But, hey, I guess anything's better
"
,,
3,3,"than looking at your smelly face!
"
,,
3,3," Mom!
"
,,
3,3," Honey, your face smells fine.
"
,,
3,3,"He doesn't mean it. It's the lack of nicotine.
"
,,
3,3,"Mom, the school janitor said
"
,,
3,3,"that Dad's working for the bad guys.
"
,,
3,3," He said it through a hole in his throat.
"
,,
3,3," That doesn't make him right.
"
,,
3,3,"If I had a hole in my throat,
"
,,
3,3,"I'd put pennies in it!
"
,,
3,3,"Your father's doing great work.
"
,,
3,3,"Life's never been better.
"
,,
3,3,"Yes. I, too, applaud the oaf
"
,,
3,3,"for finally showing initiative.
"
,,
3,3,"God knows it was years overdue.
"
,,
3,3,"You know who I saw at the market today?
"
,,
3,3,"Patty Croft. Oh, and she has gotten fat!
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, my God! Stewie, no!
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, God. What have I done?
"
,,
3,3,"I knew smoking was bad.
"
,,
3,3,"But I still sold my soul.
"
,,
3,3,"And for what? Martha Stewart?
"
,,
3,3,"Come on, kids.
"
,,
3,3,"We gotta put a stop to this. Now!
"
,,
3,3,"Finally.
"
,,
3,3,"Ah.
"
,,
3,3,"""They call me Bill

3,3,"""Yes, they call me Bill

"

3,3,"There you are. I caught Stewie smoking.
"
,,
3,3,"That cigarette company is evil.
"
,,
3,3," We can't be a part of this any more.
"
,,
3,3," This is the best job I ever had!
"
,,
3,3,"Since I became president, profits
"
,,
3,3,"have been higher than Alyssa Milano.
"
,,
3,3," What kind of cheap shot... Joel!
"
,,
3,3," I'm suing. I'm suing. I'm on it. I'm on it.
"
,,
3,3," Mr Griffin, time for your speech.
"
,,
3,3," What about your son?
"
,,
3,3,"So Stewie had a puff.
"
,,
3,3,"He's old enough to make his own decisions.
"
,,
3,3,"For God's sakes, Lois, he's one.
"
,,
3,3,"Cut the umbilical cord.
"
,,
3,3,"Ladies and gentlemen of Congress, I am
"
,,
3,3,"here today to talk to you about smoking.
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, please, Peter, do the right thing.
"
,,
3,3,"I know a lot of you are already on my side.
"
,,
3,3,"And for you naysayers,
"
,,
3,3,"I have two strong words for you...
"
,,
3,3,"Come on! Come on!
"
,,
3,3," OK. OK, sure.
"
,,
3,3," All right. Why not?
"
,,
3,3,"Thank you, ladies and...
"
,,
3,3,"...and...
"
,,
3,3,"Baby needs to suck ash!
"
,,
3,3,"Baby needs to suck ash!
"
,,
3,3,"Not ""ass"", you pervert.
"
,,
3,3,"Save it for the interns.
"
,,
3,3,"Is that a baby?
"
,,
3,3,"Oh, my God. That's Stewie. Lois was right.
"
,,
3,3,"Children under four shouldn't smoke.
"
,,
3,3,"I don't care about this job any more.
"
,,
3,3,"Cigarettes are bad!
"
,,
3,3,"Mr Griffin is right!
"
,,
3,3,"Smoking is a horrible vice!
"
,,
3,3,"It shortens life expectancy
"
,,
3,3,"and pollutes our air.
"
,,
3,3,"According to recent polls, air is good.
"
,,
3,3,"Cigarettes killed my father
"
,,
3,3,"and raped my mother!
"
,,
3,3,"I propose we send a message
"
,,
3,3,"to tobacco companies
"
,,
3,3,"by fining the El Dorado Cigarette Company
"
,,
3,3,"infinity billion dollars!
"
,,
3,3,"That's the spirit, Frank. But I think
"
,,
3,3,"a real number might be more effective.
"
,,
3,3,"All in favour of fining this evil tobacco
"
,,
3,3,"giant $100 million dollars say ""Aye"".
"
,,
3,3," Aye!
"
,,
3,3," But that'll bankrupt us!
"
,,
3,3,"You mean the way you've
"
,,
3,3,"morally bankrupted America?
"
,,
3,3,"Thanks for that zinger.
"
,,
3,3,"Give me a snappy line to go out on.
"
,,
3,3,"Actually, our lunch is here.
"
,,
3,3,"Uh...
"
,,
3,3,"Well, that's my mama!
"
,,
3,3,"Hi, I'm Peter Griffin.
"
,,
3,3,"We've had a lot of laughs tonight.
"
,,
3,3,"But I'll tell you what's not funny.
"
,,
3,3,"Killing strippers. Strippers are people, too.
"
,,
3,3,"Naked people who may be willing
"
,,
3,3,"to pleasure you for a price you negotiate.

3,3,"Besides, there's no need to kill 'em.

3,4,"All right, well, just to be safe... Oh!
"
,,
3,4,"We interrupt this programme for a bulletin
"
,,
3,4,"on the approach of Hurricane Norman.
"
,,
3,4,"Here with an update
"
,,
3,4,"is Greg the Weather Mime.
"
,,
3,4,"OK, it's gonna be cold. Very cold.
"
,,
3,4,"And there's gonna be wind.
"
,,
3,4,"And people's parents will throw faecal matter
"
,,
3,4,"down on them from the rooftops. How awful!
"
,,
3,4,"Oh. No. I'm sorry. That's rain.
"
,,
3,4,"Yes. It'll rain.
"
,,
3,4,"The number one cause of injury
"
,,
3,4,"during a hurricane is broken glass.
"
,,
3,4,"So stay away from the windows.
"
,,
3,4,"And, Peter, put those away.
"
,,
3,4,"Aw, come on, Lois. Just one more song.
"
,,
3,4,"Mom, I'm afraid if I fall asleep the hurricane's
"
,,
3,4,"gonna sneak up and give me a vasectomy.
"
,,
3,4,"Chris, nothing bad ever happens when you're
"
,,
3,4,"asleep. Sometimes good things can happen.
"
,,
3,4,"Oh, Jenny... Jenny...
"
,,
3,4,"Oh, yeah. Jenny, don't stop.
"
,,
3,4,"Oh, Richard Jeni, your HBO comedy specials
"
,,
3,4,"have brought pleasure to millions.
"
,,
3,4,"And what a sweet ass.
"
,,
3,4," This way, everyone.
"
,,
3,4," Bless you for helping us, Father.
"
,,
3,4,"It's God's wish, my dear.
"
,,
3,4,"All right.
"
,,
3,4,"Hurricane Norman is about to pound Quahog.
"
,,
3,4,"We go live to Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa
"
,,
3,4,"to see how locals are dealing
"
,,
3,4,"with the imminent disaster. Tricia?
"
,,
3,4,"Diane, I'm here in...
"
,,
3,4," Thank you, Tricia. Stay tuned for further...
"
,,
3,4," Aaargh!
"
,,
3,4," What a mess.
"
,,
3,4," Look at that!
"
,,
3,4,"Wow.
"
,,
3,4," Aaargh! Aaargh! For the love of God...
"
,,
3,4," Oh, my God! Daddy!
"
,,
3,4,"Aaargh! Oh, God! Oh, God!
"
,,
3,4,"Gotcha! See, kids? Disasters have their
"
,,
3,4,"lighter sides too. You just have to be creative.
"
,,
3,4,"Yeah, like my dead-rat marionette theatre.
"
,,
3,4,"""I'm so stressed. Life sure is a human race. ""
"
,,
3,4,"That's brilliant.
"
,,
3,4,"Oh, my. Look at all the damage.
"
,,
3,4,"Thank God
"
,,
3,4,"the Open Air Debris Garden is still intact.
"
,,
3,4,"Peter, look. The Clam.
"
,,
3,4,"Aaagh!
"
,,
3,4," This is horrible.
"
,,
3,4," You think this is horrible?
"
,,
3,4,"Try losin' a testicle
"
,,
3,4,"in a knife fight with your mother.
"
,,
3,4," What about your bar?
"
,,
3,4," It's not mine any more.
"
,,
3,4,"I sold the place. Let someone else
"
,,
3,4,"worry about hurricanes.
"
,,
3,4," Who'd buy a wrecked bar?
"
,,
3,4," The bar's not wrecked.
"
,,
3,4,"Thank you, God.
"
,,
3,4,"Don't mention it.
"
,,
3,4,"Wait. Something's different.
"
,,
3,4,"Evening, gents.
"
,,
3,4,"How about a nice warm lager?
"
,,
3,4," Help yourself to a packet of crisps.
"
,,
3,4," Or a ruddy nice plum pudding.
"
,,
3,4,"Holy crap! It's a gay bar!
"
,,
3,4,"They turned The Drunken Clam
"
,,
3,4,"into a British pub?
"
,,
3,4,"Well, at least they still got sports on TV.
"
,,
3,4,"The new bowler has a cover point, long-on,
"
,,
3,4,"square leg, extra cover and two short legs.
"
,,
3,4,"What the hell is he talkin' about?
"
,,
3,4,"It's cricket. Marvellous game, really.
"
,,
3,4,"You see, the bowler hurls the ball towards the
"
,,
3,4,"batsman, who tries to play away to fine leg.
"
,,
3,4,"He scores by dashing between the creases,
"
,,
3,4,"provided the wicketkeeper
"
,,
3,4,"hasn't whipped his bails off.
"
,,
3,4," Anybody get that?
"
,,
3,4," The only British idiom I know
"
,,
3,4,"is that ""fag"" means ""cigarette"".
"
,,
3,4," Well, someone tell this cigarette to shut up.
"
,,
3,4," Guys, there's no girlie magazines in the can!
"
,,
3,4,"All they got is this David Copperfield.
"
,,
3,4,"Wait. Any pictures of his girlfriend?
"
,,
3,4,"No pictures at all!
"
,,
3,4," I think we should go.
"
,,
3,4," Yes. This is a dark and evil place.
"
,,
3,4,"I say, Carruthers,
"
,,
3,4,"you know what's very, very funny?
"
,,
3,4,"A man dressed in women's clothing.
"
,,
3,4," Yes, quite. Ripping good laugh.
"
,,
3,4," Yes.
"
,,
3,4,"Lois, The Drunken Clam's been taken over
"
,,
3,4,"by lousy limey tea-suckin' British bastards!
"
,,
3,4," Peter!
"
,,
3,4," Hello. Nigel Pinchley here.
"
,,
3,4,"I was introducing myself to your wife, who
"
,,
3,4,"I must say is a gorgeous bit of crumpet.
"
,,
3,4," Holy crap. You're one of them!
"
,,
3,4," Peter.
"
,,
3,4,"Nigel and his daughter
"
,,
3,4,"are our new neighbours.
"
,,
3,4,"I'm afraid I'm the limey bastard
"
,,
3,4,"who's purchased your bar.
"
,,
3,4," Bit of an awkward moment, really.
"
,,
3,4," Awkward moment?
"
,,
3,4,"I'll give you an awkward moment.
"
,,
3,4,"One time during sex, I called Lois ""Frank"".
"
,,
3,4," Your move, Sherlock.
"
,,
3,4," Peter! Excuse us.
"
,,
3,4,"Why are you acting like this?
"
,,
3,4,"Nigel's charming. All British men are.
"
,,
3,4,"That's what they said
"
,,
3,4,"about Benjamin Disraeli.
"
,,
3,4,"You don't even know who I am.
"
,,
3,4,"The British are a lovely people.
"
,,
3,4,"Not physically, of course, but inside.
"
,,
3,4,"And Nigel has a very sweet little daughter.
"
,,
3,4,"Aw! Look at the little baby!
"
,,
3,4," What the devil is that ghastly noise?
"
,,
3,4," It's me. Eliza Pinchley.
"
,,
3,4,"You wanna flower, little baby?
"
,,
3,4,"Excuse me, what I think
"
,,
3,4,"you mean to say is, would I like a flower?
"
,,
3,4,"You don't so much speak the language
"
,,
3,4,"as chew it and spit it out.
"
,,
3,4,"Go on. What's wrong with the way I talk?
"
,,
3,4,"Everything. Here's a shiny sixpence
"
,,
3,4,"if you keep your mouth shut and go away.
"
,,
3,4,"Oh...
"
,,
3,4,"I know The Drunken Clam was your bar,
"
,,
3,4,"but you and your friends can find
"
,,
3,4,"somewhere else to act like idiots.
"
,,
3,4,"I guess you're right.
"
,,
3,4,"You know why I married you, Lois?
"
,,
3,4,"It's not just the rack or the caboose.
"
,,
3,4,"It's that big sexy brain of yours.
"
,,
3,4," All right. This place isn't bad.
"
,,
3,4," Yeah. Good music, real sports on the tube.
"
,,
3,4,"I've never seen so many chicks in one place.
"
,,
3,4,"Hey, check out those two hotties. They're so
"
,,
3,4,"lonely, they're practisin' kissin' each other.
"
,,
3,4,"I don't think they're practisin'.
"
,,
3,4,"Oh.
"
,,
3,4,"Oh!
"
,,
3,4,"Ohhh.
"
,,
3,4,"So, you ladies ever been penetrated?
"
,,
3,4," Yep.
"
,,
3,4," Yep.
"
,,
3,4," Yup.
"
,,
3,4," Mm-hm.
"
,,
3,4,"Hope the loo is working.
"
,,
3,4,"Nice choice for a hang-out, Peter.
"
,,
3,4,"There's not even anywhere to sit down.
"
,,
3,4," Is that some kind of crack?
"
,,
3,4," Crack? You sayin' I got a fat ass?
"
,,
3,4,"Fellas, fellas. What's become of us?
"
,,
3,4,"We never squabbled before we lost The Clam.
"
,,
3,4," Right. It's those lousy fog-breathers.
"
,,
3,4," Damn British.
"
,,
3,4,"They took our bar, then our friendship. What's
"
,,
3,4,"next? Apple pie, fast cars and action films?
"
,,
3,4,"It vas a glorious summer
"
,,
3,4,"in Oxford ven I met Freddy Cavendish.
"
,,
3,4,"A most remarkable young man whose
"
,,
3,4,"friendship vould change my life forever.
"
,,
3,4,"You are the anchor
"
,,
3,4,"that gives my spirit licence to soar.
"
,,
3,4,"Our forefathers wouldn't
"
,,
3,4,"take it on the chin like this.
"
,,
3,4,"Right. I say we fight the British and drive 'em
"
,,
3,4,"back to whatever country they came from.
"
,,
3,4," Yeah! Yeah!
"
,,
3,4," We gonna get 'em.
"
,,
3,4,"Stewie, look. It's an invitation
"
,,
3,4,"to little Eliza's birthday party.
"
,,
3,4,"You mean that horrid girl
"
,,
3,4,"who talks like a scullery maid?
"
,,
3,4,"I didn't realise she'd been born. I assumed
"
,,
3,4,"she'd congealed in a gutter somewhere.
"
,,
3,4,"Ooh, I'm gonna RSVP right now.
"
,,
3,4,"Splendid. An entire afternoon of her ""er""s
"
,,
3,4,"and ""ah""s and ""'alf a pound of ha'penny rice"".
"
,,
3,4,"Why can't the English
"
,,
3,4,"teach their children how to speak?
"
,,
3,4,"You teach her. If you're up to it.
"
,,
3,4,"Oh, yes. This is the part where I'm
"
,,
3,4,"supposed to say ""I am so up to it. Ha ha ha. ""
"
,,
3,4,"Well, I am. I accept your challenge.
"
,,
3,4,"At her party I shall pass that guttersnipe off
"
,,
3,4,"as a lady. What are the stakes of this wager?
"
,,
3,4," Why don't you shut up for about a week?
"
,,
3,4," And if I win?
"
,,
3,4,"I wasn't betting. Why don't you
"
,,
3,4,"just shut up for about a week?
"
,,
3,4,"You're on!
"
,,
3,4,"Minutemen, present arms.
"
,,
3,4," Load weapons.
"
,,
3,4," Boom chaka-laka-laka boom chaka-laka.
"
,,
3,4,"Fire!
"
,,
3,4," Oh, I say!
"
,,
3,4," Throw the blackguards out.
"
,,
3,4," I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to leave.
"
,,
3,4," Don't tread on me.
"
,,
3,4,"Yeah, back off. We kicked your ass
"
,,
3,4,"in World War II and we can do it again.
"
,,
3,4,"Very well, then. If you refuse to go peaceably,
"
,,
3,4,"we'll have to use our superior
"
,,
3,4,"linguistic skills to convince you to leave.
"
,,
3,4,"Just try it.
"
,,
3,4," Bye.
"
,,
3,4," Sorry to bother you.
"
,,
3,4,"I never saw it that way before...
"
,,
3,4,"Wait a minute. How the hell did they do that?
"
,,
3,4,"We're not gonna let this stop us.
"
,,
3,4,"I've never been defeated. Except once.
"
,,
3,4," Eric?
"
,,
3,4," Peter?
"
,,
3,4,"Oh, my God. I haven't seen you since
"
,,
3,4,"high school. What are you doin' these days?
"
,,
3,4," I'm the red guy.
"
,,
3,4," Oh, my God.
"
,,
3,4," What about you?
"
,,
3,4," I'm the green guy.
"
,,
3,4," No kiddin'?
"
,,
3,4," Yeah.
"
,,
3,4," Hey, is that Stacy Beacham?
"
,,
3,4," Where?
"
,,
3,4,"Now, don't worry, these guys are trained
"
,,
3,4,"to stay perfectly still. Check it out.
"
,,
3,4,"Hey, Margaret Tha... What the hell...?
"
,,
3,4,"I thought you English guys never move.
"
,,
3,4,"No, that's just our women.
"
,,
3,4,"Bloody hell! My lunch was in that hat!
"
,,
3,4,"Egg and chips with jam butties.
"
,,
3,4," Welcome to the Quahog beer party.
"
,,
3,4," I do feel a little guilty about pollutin'.
"
,,
3,4," I felt Guilty once, but she woke up.
"
,,
3,4," Peter, what are you doin'?
"
,,
3,4,"It may taste like a warm cup of
"
,,
3,4,"tobacco-chewer's spit, but it's still beer.
"
,,
3,4,"Good point. Bottoms up!
"
,,
3,4,"Ha! Take that, you lousy Brits!
"
,,
3,4,"Peter! We waited up all night.
"
,,
3,4,"Where were you?
"
,,
3,4,"Wh-where was I? Where were you?
"
,,
3,4," Out drinkin'. But I was back by two.
"
,,
3,4," Oh, no.
"
,,
3,4,"Our top story: The Clam's Head Pub
"
,,
3,4,"has burned to the ground.
"
,,
3,4,"Our own Tricia Takanawa is on the scene.
"
,,
3,4,"Is Quahog in the grip of a serial arsonist?
"
,,
3,4,"Police say no, but our producer says yes.
"
,,
3,4,"Here's an artist's depiction
"
,,
3,4,"of what the arsonist might look like.
"
,,
3,4,"Anyone with information regarding this
"
,,
3,4,"suspect should contact police immediately.
"
,,
3,4,"One thing is certain: The pain here is palpable.
"
,,
3,4,"For many, this charred portrait of Elizabeth II
"
,,
3,4,"gives poignant new meaning to the phrase
"
,,
3,4,"""Hey, check out that flaming queen. ""
"
,,
3,4,"In a late development
"
,,
3,4,"the police have a new suspect.
"
,,
3,4,"We now go live to Hispanic
"
,,
3,4,"reporter Maria J... Ji... Jim...
"
,,
3,4," Jimenez.
"
,,
3,4," I know what it is.
"
,,
3,4,"At this moment we're
"
,,
3,4,"approaching the suspect's house.
"
,,
3,4,"This is better than COPS. You know
"
,,
3,4,"there's a fat drunk guy in there.
"
,,
3,4," Hold it!
"
,,
3,4," Freeze!
"
,,
3,4," There he is.
"
,,
3,4," Griffin, you're comin' with us.
"
,,
3,4,"I wanna see what they do with this jackass.
"
,,
3,4," Hands up!
"
,,
3,4," Oh, Peter, you didn't!
"
,,
3,4," Hey, fatty's wife is a babe.
"
,,
3,4," That's it.
"
,,
3,4,"It appears the real arsonist is in custody,
"
,,
3,4,"thanks to an anonymous tip to the authorities.
"
,,
3,4,"Good. Good.
"
,,
3,4,"Ah, the fat guy's struggling. Hit him,
"
,,
3,4,"you stupid pigs! Hit him. Use the billy...
"
,,
3,4,"This Minutemen flag was found
"
,,
3,4,"in the wreckage of The Clam's Head.
"
,,
3,4,"You are clearly guilty of arson,
"
,,
3,4,"so you are free to go.
"
,,
3,4,"Straight to jail. Ha!
"
,,
3,4,"Now you got burned! No bail.
"
,,
3,4," Peter, tell me you didn't do this.
"
,,
3,4," Lois, I didn't do it.
"
,,
3,4,"You can trust me, right?
"
,,
3,4,"Let's sit down and talk about this.
"
,,
3,4," I wanna believe you but... agh!
"
,,
3,4," Gotcha!
"
,,
3,4,"But seriously, you can trust me.
"
,,
3,4,"Oh, Lois, I'm so sorry
"
,,
3,4,"this terrible tragedy has befallen you.
"
,,
3,4,"Thank you, Nigel. You're very kind.
"
,,
3,4," Can I touch your bum once?
"
,,
3,4," What?
"
,,
3,4,"I expect to see you at Eliza's birthday bash.
"
,,
3,4,"I won't take no for an answer.
"
,,
3,4,"Unless the question is ""Do you not like me?""
"
,,
3,4,"Get it? Double negative, you know.
"
,,
3,4,"Yes, very good.
"
,,
3,4,"Hey hey hey, check out the new meat.
"
,,
3,4," I like the fat one. More cushion for pushin'.
"
,,
3,4," Thank you.
"
,,
3,4," Hey, we gonna have a good time together.
"
,,
3,4," Gosh, everybody's so nice here.
"
,,
3,4,"I mean, they're gonna be disappointed
"
,,
3,4,"when they find out I'm not gay, but wow.
"
,,
3,4,"Oh, my God. See that guy? That's the most
"
,,
3,4,"vicious killer I ever put away, Steve Bellows.
"
,,
3,4," He's so mean, he shot a man for snoring.
"
,,
3,4," Where have I heard that before?
"
,,
3,4,"It's in this simulated-leather edition
"
,,
3,4,"of Time-Life's Killers of Quahog.
"
,,
3,4,"They're all here. John the Biter, the Berserk
"
,,
3,4,"Hobo, the Golden Autumn Day Strangler...
"
,,
3,4,"Maybe Steve won't remember you.
"
,,
3,4,"Well, well. Officer Swanson. You and
"
,,
3,4,"your friends are dead. You're all dead!
"
,,
3,4,"Oh, good.
"
,,
3,4,"He thinks we're zombies. He'll leave us alone.
"
,,
3,4,"No, no, no! If you're ever going to
"
,,
3,4,"be a lady, you must speak like one.
"
,,
3,4,"Now try it again. ""The life
"
,,
3,4,"of the wife is ended by the knife. ""
"
,,
3,4,"The loif of the woif...
"
,,
3,4,"No, no, no. Not ""loif"". Life! Life!
"
,,
3,4," That's what I said. Loif.
"
,,
3,4," Listen, you tin-eared piece of baggage.
"
,,
3,4,"We've got five days left, and I'll not
"
,,
3,4,"lose my wager. Now repeat after me.
"
,,
3,4,"""Hello, Mother,
"
,,
3,4,"have you hidden my hatchet?""
"
,,
3,4,"'Ello, Mother, 'ave you 'idden my 'atchet?
"
,,
3,4,"Oh, God, no. It's an H sound,
"
,,
3,4,"you moron. H! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
"
,,
3,4," Ew. Your breath smells like kitty litter.
"
,,
3,4," I was curious!
"
,,
3,4," Our husbands couldn't have done this.
"
,,
3,4," Cleveland can't even light the damn hibachi.
"
,,
3,4,"Excuse me. Where can I find Nigel Pinchley?
"
,,
3,4,"I'm from Quahog Insurance.
"
,,
3,4,"I have a cheque for him.
"
,,
3,4," Five million dollars?!
"
,,
3,4," He took out a policy just before the fire.
"
,,
3,4,"Doesn't that strike you as a little suspicious?
"
,,
3,4,"No, not really. In fact,
"
,,
3,4,"it seems to happen all the time.
"
,,
3,4," Oh, no. Here comes Steve!
"
,,
3,4," I haven't forgot about you boys.
"
,,
3,4,"Saturday night at midnight.
"
,,
3,4,"You're dead. All of you are dead.
"
,,
3,4,"Midnight on Saturday? Thank God!
"
,,
3,4,"We can still be in the talent show.
"
,,
3,4,"From the top, boys. A-five, six, seven, eight.
"
,,
3,4,"Once again, here is how it should sound.
"
,,
3,4,"""How do you do?"" Here's how you sound.
"
,,
3,4,"Now try it again.
"
,,
3,4," How do you do?
"
,,
3,4," What did you say?
"
,,
3,4,"""The life of the wife is ended by the knife. ""
"
,,
3,4,"I think she's got it. I think she's got it!
"
,,
3,4,"""The life of the wife is ended by the knife
"
,,
3,4,"By George, she's got it!
"
,,
3,4,"By George, she's got it!
"
,,
3,4,"Now, what ends her wretched life?
"
,,
3,4,"""The knife, the knife
"
,,
3,4,"And where's that bloody knife?
"
,,
3,4,"""In the wife, in the wife
"
,,
3,4,""" The life of the wife
"
,,
3,4,"is ended by the knife
"
,,
3,4,"Bravo, Eliza!

3,4,"""The life of the wife is ended by the knife
"
,,
3,4,"Hello. So nice to see you.
"
,,
3,4,"There he is. We need to search the house for
"
,,
3,4,"evidence, but one of us has to distract Nigel.
"
,,
3,4,"Oh, no, no, no. I couldn't.
"
,,
3,4,"What about Loretta? Nigel looks
"
,,
3,4,"like he's down with the swirl.
"
,,
3,4,"There you are, Lois. Shall I give you the grand
"
,,
3,4,"tour and show you my... private quarters?
"
,,
3,4," I'd love to.
"
,,
3,4," I must say, you look absolutely...
"
,,
3,4,"mmm... mmm... mm-mm-mm.
"
,,
3,4,"Don't be shy, lambie lamb.
"
,,
3,4,"This is my study, where I... study
"
,,
3,4,"things that arouse my interest.
"
,,
3,4,"Oh, good. The girls are in place.
"
,,
3,4,"Oh, Nigel. Since Peter's been gone,
"
,,
3,4,"I've been searching for someone new.
"
,,
3,4,"You know? Someone with
"
,,
3,4,"a sense of danger and adventure.
"
,,
3,4," I once played cricket without shin guards.
"
,,
3,4," Oh, I love a reckless man.
"
,,
3,4,"One time I went up to this bloke's flat,
"
,,
3,4,"rang the bell and ran like Sebastian Coe.
"
,,
3,4,"More! Tell me more!
"
,,
3,4,"I burned down my pub for the insurance
"
,,
3,4,"money and framed your husband.
"
,,
3,4,"I knew it! And what's more,
"
,,
3,4,"I have witnesses. Bonnie.
"
,,
3,4,"Loretta?
"
,,
3,4,"Demond Wilson from Sanford
"
,,
3,4,"and Son? What are you doing here?
"
,,
3,4,"I know. I'm surprised I'm alive too.
"
,,
3,4,"Sorry, love. Better luck next time.
"
,,
3,4,"Mr Pinchley, I heard everything.
"
,,
3,4,"And what you've done is a textbook
"
,,
3,4,"example of insurance... fra-ud?
"
,,
3,4,"Bloody hell.
"
,,
3,4," Why the devil were you in the closet?
"
,,
3,4," I came with Demond.
"
,,
3,4,"Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Eliza Pinchley.
"
,,
3,4,"Psst. You. Dogbert. Down here.
"
,,
3,4,"Get a front-row seat for this one.
"
,,
3,4,"How kind of you all to come.
"
,,
3,4,"Magnificent!
"
,,
3,4,"Old sport, why don't you pull your face from
"
,,
3,4,"your loins and bury it into some humble pie?
"
,,
3,4,"Bloody 'ell!
"
,,
3,4,"I've gone and wet meself.
"
,,
3,4,"Don't give me that smug look. Fine!
"
,,
3,4,"You have extra-sensitive hearing: Hear this.
"
,,
3,4," I'm telling.
"
,,
3,4," I... No! I said ""vacuum""!
"
,,
3,4," Hurry, Peter. Steve'll be here in five minutes.
"
,,
3,4," Oh, crap. We're dead.
"
,,
3,4,"This is the end, boys.
"
,,
3,4,"Looks like our next stop
"
,,
3,4,"is a corner booth in a bar in heaven.
"
,,
3,4,"Peter, Nigel confessed. You're free!
"
,,
3,4,"You hear that, guys? We're free!
"
,,
3,4,"Get ready to die! Oh.
"
,,
3,4,"I wonder what this feels like.
"
,,
3,4,"Ow! That hurts!
"
,,
3,4,"My God, is that what I've been
"
,,
3,4,"doin' to people? I belong here.
"
,,
3,4,"Horace, I never thought
"
,,
3,4,"I'd see you or The Clam again.
"
,,
3,4,"Florida stunk.
"
,,
3,4,"Alligator mounted me when I wasn't lookin'.
"
,,
3,4,"Laid eggs in my lower intestine.
"
,,
3,4,"But you're all thirsty.
"
,,
3,4,"I'll bore you another time.
"
,,
3,4,"Here's to our wives. They may not be
"
,,
3,4,"as hot as the women you see on TV.
"
,,
3,4,"Or as entertaining.
"
,,
3,4,"But, um...
"
,,
3,4,"I don't know where I'm goin'
"
,,
3,4,"with this. But thanks.
"
,,
3,4,"I guess that lousy Nigel learned his lesson.
"
,,
3,4,"Whatever he gets is too good for him.
"
,,
3,4,"Dear Stewie, I want you to know
"
,,
3,4,"that I blame my father's death
"
,,
3,4,"and my incarceration in this hellhole
"
,,
3,4,"entirely on your awful mother.
"
,,
3,4,"If it takes the rest of my life, I shall see that
"
,,
3,4,"she suffers a slow and painful death. Eliza.
"
,,
3,4,"Excellent. Here, have a look.
"

3,4,"Oh. No. I'm sorry. That's rain.

3,4," It's not mine any more.

3,4,"I sold the place. Let someone else

"

3,4," Help yourself to a packet of crisps.
"
,,
3,4," Or a ruddy nice plum pudding.
"
,,
3,4,"Holy crap! It's a gay bar!
"
,,
3,4,"They turned The Drunken Clam
"
,,
3,4,"into a British pub?
"
,,
3,4,"Well, at least they still got sports on TV.
"
,,
3,4,"The new bowler has a cover point, long-on,
"
,,
3,4,"square leg, extra cover and two short legs.
"
,,
3,4,"What the hell is he talkin' about?
"
,,
3,4,"It's cricket. Marvellous game, really.
"
,,
3,4,"You see, the bowler hurls the ball towards the
"
,,
3,4,"batsman, who tries to play away to fine leg.
"
,,
3,4,"He scores by dashing between the creases,
"
,,
3,4,"provided the wicketkeeper
"
,,
3,4,"hasn't whipped his bails off.
"
,,
3,4," Anybody get that?
"
,,
3,4," The only British idiom I know
"
,,
3,4,"is that ""fag"" means ""cigarette"".
"
,,
3,4," Well, someone tell this cigarette to shut up.
"
,,
3,4," Guys, there's no girlie magazines in the can!
"
,,
3,4,"All they got is this David Copperfield.
"
,,
3,4,"Wait. Any pictures of his girlfriend?
"
,,
3,4,"No pictures at all!
"
,,
3,4," I think we should go.
"
,,
3,4," Yes. This is a dark and evil place.
"
,,
3,4,"I say, Carruthers,
"
,,
3,4,"you know what's very, very funny?
"
,,
3,4,"A man dressed in women's clothing.
"
,,
3,4," Yes, quite. Ripping good laugh.
"
,,
3,4," Yes.
"
,,
3,4,"Lois, The Drunken Clam's been taken over
"
,,
3,4,"by lousy limey tea-suckin' British bastards!
"
,,
3,4," Peter!
"
,,
3,4," Hello. Nigel Pinchley here.
"
,,
3,4,"I was introducing myself to your wife, who
"
,,
3,4,"I must say is a gorgeous bit of crumpet.
"
,,
3,4," Holy crap. You're one of them!
"
,,
3,4," Peter.
"
,,
3,4,"Nigel and his daughter
"
,,
3,4,"are our new neighbours.
"
,,
3,4,"I'm afraid I'm the limey bastard
"
,,
3,4,"who's purchased your bar.
"
,,
3,4," Bit of an awkward moment, really.
"
,,
3,4," Awkward moment?
"
,,
3,4,"I'll give you an awkward moment.
"
,,
3,4,"One time during sex, I called Lois ""Frank"".
"
,,
3,4," Your move, Sherlock.
"
,,
3,4," Peter! Excuse us.
"
,,
3,4,"Why are you acting like this?
"
,,
3,4,"Nigel's charming. All British men are.
"
,,
3,4,"That's what they said
"
,,
3,4,"about Benjamin Disraeli.
"
,,
3,4,"You don't even know who I am.
"
,,
3,4,"The British are a lovely people.
"
,,
3,4,"Not physically, of course, but inside.
"
,,
3,4,"And Nigel has a very sweet little daughter.
"
,,
3,4,"Aw! Look at the little baby!
"
,,
3,4," What the devil is that ghastly noise?
"
,,
3,4," It's me. Eliza Pinchley.
"
,,
3,4,"You wanna flower, little baby?
"
,,
3,4,"Excuse me, what I think
"
,,
3,4,"you mean to say is, would I like a flower?
"
,,
3,4,"You don't so much speak the language
"
,,
3,4,"as chew it and spit it out.
"
,,
3,4,"Go on. What's wrong with the way I talk?
"
,,
3,4,"Everything. Here's a shiny sixpence
"
,,
3,4,"if you keep your mouth shut and go away.
"
,,
3,4,"Oh...
"
,,
3,4,"I know The Drunken Clam was your bar,
"
,,
3,4,"but you and your friends can find
"
,,
3,4,"somewhere else to act like idiots.
"
,,
3,4,"I guess you're right.
"
,,
3,4,"You know why I married you, Lois?
"
,,
3,4,"It's not just the rack or the caboose.
"
,,
3,4,"It's that big sexy brain of yours.
"
,,
3,4," All right. This place isn't bad.
"
,,
3,4," Yeah. Good music, real sports on the tube.
"
,,
3,4,"I've never seen so many chicks in one place.
"
,,
3,4,"Hey, check out those two hotties. They're so
"
,,
3,4,"lonely, they're practisin' kissin' each other.
"
,,
3,4,"I don't think they're practisin'.
"
,,
3,4,"Oh.
"
,,
3,4,"Oh!
"
,,
3,4,"Ohhh.
"
,,
3,4,"So, you ladies ever been penetrated?
"
,,
3,4," Yep.
"
,,
3,4," Yep.
"
,,
3,4," Yup.
"
,,
3,4," Mm-hm.
"
,,
3,4,"Hope the loo is working.
"
,,
3,4,"Nice choice for a hang-out, Peter.
"
,,
3,4,"There's not even anywhere to sit down.
"
,,
3,4," Is that some kind of crack?
"
,,
3,4," Crack? You sayin' I got a fat ass?
"
,,
3,4,"Fellas, fellas. What's become of us?
"
,,
3,4,"We never squabbled before we lost The Clam.
"
,,
3,4," Right. It's those lousy fog-breathers.
"
,,
3,4," Damn British.
"
,,
3,4,"They took our bar, then our friendship. What's
"
,,
3,4,"next? Apple pie, fast cars and action films?
"
,,
3,4,"It vas a glorious summer
"
,,
3,4,"in Oxford ven I met Freddy Cavendish.
"
,,
3,4,"A most remarkable young man whose
"
,,
3,4,"friendship vould change my life forever.
"
,,
3,4,"You are the anchor
"
,,
3,4,"that gives my spirit licence to soar.
"
,,
3,4,"Our forefathers wouldn't
"
,,
3,4,"take it on the chin like this.
"
,,
3,4,"Right. I say we fight the British and drive 'em
"
,,
3,4,"back to whatever country they came from.
"
,,
3,4," Yeah! Yeah!
"
,,
3,4," We gonna get 'em.
"
,,
3,4,"Stewie, look. It's an invitation
"
,,
3,4,"to little Eliza's birthday party.
"
,,
3,4,"You mean that horrid girl
"
,,
3,4,"who talks like a scullery maid?
"
,,
3,4,"I didn't realise she'd been born. I assumed
"
,,
3,4,"she'd congealed in a gutter somewhere.
"
,,
3,4,"Ooh, I'm gonna RSVP right now.
"
,,
3,4,"Splendid. An entire afternoon of her ""er""s
"
,,
3,4,"and ""ah""s and ""'alf a pound of ha'penny rice"".
"
,,
3,4,"Why can't the English
"
,,
3,4,"teach their children how to speak?
"
,,
3,4,"You teach her. If you're up to it.
"
,,
3,4,"Oh, yes. This is the part where I'm
"
,,
3,4,"supposed to say ""I am so up to it. Ha ha ha. ""
"
,,
3,4,"Well, I am. I accept your challenge.
"
,,
3,4,"At her party I shall pass that guttersnipe off
"
,,
3,4,"as a lady. What are the stakes of this wager?
"
,,
3,4," Why don't you shut up for about a week?
"
,,
3,4," And if I win?
"
,,
3,4,"I wasn't betting. Why don't you
"
,,
3,4,"just shut up for about a week?
"
,,
3,4,"You're on!
"
,,
3,4,"Minutemen, present arms.
"
,,
3,4," Load weapons.
"
,,
3,4," Boom chaka-laka-laka boom chaka-laka.
"
,,
3,4,"Fire!
"
,,
3,4," Oh, I say!
"
,,
3,4," Throw the blackguards out.
"
,,
3,4," I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to leave.
"
,,
3,4," Don't tread on me.
"
,,
3,4,"Yeah, back off. We kicked your ass
"
,,
3,4,"in World War II and we can do it again.
"
,,
3,4,"Very well, then. If you refuse to go peaceably,
"
,,
3,4,"we'll have to use our superior
"
,,
3,4,"linguistic skills to convince you to leave.
"
,,
3,4,"Just try it.
"
,,
3,4," Bye.
"
,,
3,4," Sorry to bother you.
"
,,
3,4,"I never saw it that way before...
"
,,
3,4,"Wait a minute. How the hell did they do that?

3,4,"We're not gonna let this stop us.

3,4," Hey, is that Stacy Beacham?
"
,,
3,4," Where?

3,4,"Now, don't worry, these guys are trained

"
,,
3,4,"No, that's just our women.

3,4,"Egg and chips with jam butties.
"
,,
3,4," Welcome to the Quahog beer party.
"
,,
3,4," I do feel a little guilty about pollutin'.
"
,,
3,4," I felt Guilty once, but she woke up.
"
,,
3,4," Peter, what are you doin'?
"
,,
3,4,"It may taste like a warm cup of
"
,,
3,4,"tobacco-chewer's spit, but it's still beer.
"
,,
3,4,"Good point. Bottoms up!
"
,,
3,4,"Ha! Take that, you lousy Brits!
"
,,
3,4,"Peter! We waited up all night.
"
,,
3,4,"Where were you?
"
,,
3,4,"Wh-where was I? Where were you?
"
,,
3,4," Out drinkin'. But I was back by two.
"
,,
3,4," Oh, no.
"
,,
3,4,"Our top story: The Clam's Head Pub
"
,,
3,4,"has burned to the ground.
"
,,
3,4,"Our own Tricia Takanawa is on the scene.
"
,,
3,4,"Is Quahog in the grip of a serial arsonist?
"
,,
3,4,"Police say no, but our producer says yes.

3,4,"Here's an artist's depiction
"
,,
3,4,"of what the arsonist might look like.
"

3,4,"Anyone with information regarding this
"

3,4,"suspect should contact police immediately.
"
,,
3,4,"One thing is certain: The pain here is palpable.

3,4,"In a late development
"
,,
3,4,"the police have a new suspect.
"
,,
3,4,"We now go live to Hispanic
"
,,
3,4,"reporter Maria J... Ji... Jim...
"
,,
3,4," Jimenez.
"
,,
3,4," I know what it is.
"
,,
3,4,"At this moment we're
"
,,
3,4,"approaching the suspect's house.
"
,,
3,4,"This is better than COPS. You know
"
,,
3,4,"there's a fat drunk guy in there.
"
,,
3,4," Hold it!
"
,,
3,4," Freeze!
"
,,
3,4," There he is.
"
,,
3,4," Griffin, you're comin' with us.
"
,,
3,4,"I wanna see what they do with this jackass.
"
,,
3,4," Hands up!
"
,,
3,4," Oh, Peter, you didn't!
"
,,
3,4," Hey, fatty's wife is a babe.
"
,,
3,4," That's it.
"
,,
3,4,"It appears the real arsonist is in custody,
"
,,
3,4,"thanks to an anonymous tip to the authorities.
"
,,
3,4,"Good. Good.
"
,,
3,4,"Ah, the fat guy's struggling. Hit him,
"
,,
3,4,"you stupid pigs! Hit him. Use the billy...
"
,,
3,4,"This Minutemen flag was found
"
,,
3,4,"in the wreckage of The Clam's Head.
"
,,
3,4,"You are clearly guilty of arson,
"
,,
3,4,"so you are free to go.
"
,,
3,4,"Straight to jail. Ha!
"
,,
3,4,"Now you got burned! No bail.
"
,,
3,4," Peter, tell me you didn't do this.
"
,,
3,4," Lois, I didn't do it.
"
,,
3,4,"You can trust me, right?
"
,,
3,4,"Let's sit down and talk about this.
"
,,
3,4," I wanna believe you but... agh!
"
,,
3,4," Gotcha!
"
,,
3,4,"But seriously, you can trust me.
"
,,
3,4,"Oh, Lois, I'm so sorry
"
,,
3,4,"this terrible tragedy has befallen you.
"
,,
3,4,"Thank you, Nigel. You're very kind.
"
,,
3,4," Can I touch your bum once?
"
,,
3,4," What?
"
,,
3,4,"I expect to see you at Eliza's birthday bash.
"
,,
3,4,"I won't take no for an answer.
"
,,
3,4,"Unless the question is ""Do you not like me?""
"
,,
3,4,"Get it? Double negative, you know.
"
,,
3,4,"Yes, very good.
"
,,
3,4,"Hey hey hey, check out the new meat.
"
,,
3,4," I like the fat one. More cushion for pushin'.
"
,,
3,4," Thank you.
"
,,
3,4," Hey, we gonna have a good time together.
"
,,
3,4," Gosh, everybody's so nice here.
"
,,
3,4,"I mean, they're gonna be disappointed
"
,,
3,4,"when they find out I'm not gay, but wow.
"
,,
3,4,"Oh, my God. See that guy? That's the most
"
,,
3,4,"vicious killer I ever put away, Steve Bellows.
"
,,
3,4," He's so mean, he shot a man for snoring.
"
,,
3,4," Where have I heard that before?
"
,,
3,4,"It's in this simulated-leather edition
"
,,
3,4,"of Time-Life's Killers of Quahog.
"
,,
3,4,"They're all here. John the Biter, the Berserk
"
,,
3,4,"Hobo, the Golden Autumn Day Strangler...
"
,,
3,4,"Maybe Steve won't remember you.
"
,,
3,4,"Well, well. Officer Swanson. You and
"
,,
3,4,"your friends are dead. You're all dead!
"
,,
3,4,"Oh, good.
"
,,
3,4,"He thinks we're zombies. He'll leave us alone.
"
,,
3,4,"No, no, no! If you're ever going to
"
,,
3,4,"be a lady, you must speak like one.
"
,,
3,4,"Now try it again. ""The life
"
,,
3,4,"of the wife is ended by the knife. ""
"
,,
3,4,"The loif of the woif...
"
,,
3,4,"No, no, no. Not ""loif"". Life! Life!
"
,,
3,4," That's what I said. Loif.
"
,,
3,4," Listen, you tin-eared piece of baggage.
"
,,
3,4,"We've got five days left, and I'll not
"
,,
3,4,"lose my wager. Now repeat after me.
"
,,
3,4,"""Hello, Mother,
"
,,
3,4,"have you hidden my hatchet?""
"
,,
3,4,"'Ello, Mother, 'ave you 'idden my 'atchet?
"
,,
3,4,"Oh, God, no. It's an H sound,
"
,,
3,4,"you moron. H! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!
"
,,
3,4," Ew. Your breath smells like kitty litter.
"
,,
3,4," I was curious!
"
,,
3,4," Our husbands couldn't have done this.
"
,,
3,4," Cleveland can't even light the damn hibachi.
"
,,
3,4,"Excuse me. Where can I find Nigel Pinchley?
"
,,
3,4,"I'm from Quahog Insurance.
"
,,
3,4,"I have a cheque for him.
"
,,
3,4," Five million dollars?!
"
,,
3,4," He took out a policy just before the fire.
"
,,
3,4,"Doesn't that strike you as a little suspicious?
"
,,
3,4,"No, not really. In fact,
"
,,
3,4,"it seems to happen all the time.
"
,,
3,4," Oh, no. Here comes Steve!
"
,,
3,4," I haven't forgot about you boys.
"
,,
3,4,"Saturday night at midnight.
"
,,
3,4,"You're dead. All of you are dead.
"
,,
3,4,"Midnight on Saturday? Thank God!
"
,,
3,4,"We can still be in the talent show.
"
,,
3,4,"From the top, boys. A-five, six, seven, eight.
"
,,
3,4,"Once again, here is how it should sound.
"
,,
3,4,"""How do you do?"" Here's how you sound.
"
,,
3,4,"Now try it again.
"
,,
3,4," How do you do?
"
,,
3,4," What did you say?
"
,,
3,4,"""The life of the wife is ended by the knife. ""
"
,,
3,4,"I think she's got it. I think she's got it!
"
,,
3,4,"""The life of the wife is ended by the knife
"
,,
3,4,"By George, she's got it!
"
,,
3,4,"By George, she's got it!
"
,,
3,4,"Now, what ends her wretched life?
"
,,
3,4,"""The knife, the knife
"
,,
3,4,"And where's that bloody knife?
"
,,
3,4,"""In the wife, in the wife
"
,,
3,4,""" The life of the wife
"

3,4,"is ended by the knife
"
,,
3,4,"Bravo, Eliza!
"
,,
3,4,"""The life of the wife is ended by the knife
"
,,
3,4,"Hello. So nice to see you.
"
,,
3,4,"There he is. We need to search the house for
"
,,
3,4,"evidence, but one of us has to distract Nigel.
"
,,
3,4,"Oh, no, no, no. I couldn't.
"
,,
3,4,"What about Loretta? Nigel looks
"
,,
3,4,"like he's down with the swirl.
"
,,
3,4,"There you are, Lois. Shall I give you the grand
"
,,
3,4,"tour and show you my... private quarters?
"
,,
3,4," I'd love to.
"
,,
3,4," I must say, you look absolutely...
"
,,
3,4,"mmm... mmm... mm-mm-mm.
"
,,
3,4,"Don't be shy, lambie lamb.
"
,,
3,4,"This is my study, where I... study
"
,,
3,4,"things that arouse my interest.
"
,,
3,4,"Oh, good. The girls are in place.
"
,,
3,4,"Oh, Nigel. Since Peter's been gone,
"
,,
3,4,"I've been searching for someone new.
"
,,
3,4,"You know? Someone with
"
,,
3,4,"a sense of danger and adventure.
"
,,
3,4," I once played cricket without shin guards.
"
,,
3,4," Oh, I love a reckless man.
"
,,
3,4,"One time I went up to this bloke's flat,
"
,,
3,4,"rang the bell and ran like Sebastian Coe.
"
,,
3,4,"More! Tell me more!
"
,,
3,4,"I burned down my pub for the insurance
"
,,
3,4,"money and framed your husband.
"
,,
3,4,"I knew it! And what's more,
"
,,
3,4,"I have witnesses. Bonnie.
"
,,
3,4,"Loretta?
"
,,
3,4,"Demond Wilson from Sanford
"
,,
3,4,"and Son? What are you doing here?
"
,,
3,4,"I know. I'm surprised I'm alive too.
"
,,
3,4,"Sorry, love. Better luck next time.
"
,,
3,4,"Mr Pinchley, I heard everything.
"
,,
3,4,"And what you've done is a textbook
"
,,
3,4,"example of insurance... fra-ud?
"
,,
3,4,"Bloody hell.
"
,,
3,4," Why the devil were you in the closet?
"
,,
3,4," I came with Demond.
"
,,
3,4,"Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Eliza Pinchley.
"
,,
3,4,"Psst. You. Dogbert. Down here.
"
,,
3,4,"Get a front-row seat for this one.
"
,,
3,4,"How kind of you all to come.
"
,,
3,4,"Magnificent!
"
,,
3,4,"Old sport, why don't you pull your face from
"
,,
3,4,"your loins and bury it into some humble pie?
"
,,
3,4,"Bloody 'ell!
"
,,
3,4,"I've gone and wet meself.
"
,,
3,4,"Don't give me that smug look. Fine!
"
,,
3,4,"You have extra-sensitive hearing: Hear this.
"
,,
3,4," I'm telling.
"
,,
3,4," I... No! I said ""vacuum""!
"
,,
3,4," Hurry, Peter. Steve'll be here in five minutes.
"
,,
3,4," Oh, crap. We're dead.
"
,,
3,4,"This is the end, boys.
"
,,
3,4,"Looks like our next stop
"
,,
3,4,"is a corner booth in a bar in heaven.
"
,,
3,4,"Peter, Nigel confessed. You're free!
"
,,
3,4,"You hear that, guys? We're free!
"
,,
3,4,"Get ready to die! Oh.
"
,,
3,4,"I wonder what this feels like.
"
,,
3,4,"Ow! That hurts!
"
,,
3,4,"My God, is that what I've been
"
,,
3,4,"doin' to people? I belong here.
"
,,
3,4,"Horace, I never thought
"
,,
3,4,"I'd see you or The Clam again.
"
,,
3,4,"Florida stunk.
"
,,
3,4,"Alligator mounted me when I wasn't lookin'.
"
,,
3,4,"Laid eggs in my lower intestine.
"
,,
3,4,"But you're all thirsty.
"
,,
3,4,"I'll bore you another time.
"
,,
3,4,"Here's to our wives. They may not be
"
,,
3,4,"as hot as the women you see on TV.
"
,,
3,4,"Or as entertaining.
"
,,
3,4,"But, um...
"
,,
3,4,"I don't know where I'm goin'
"
,,
3,4,"with this. But thanks.
"
,,
3,4,"I guess that lousy Nigel learned his lesson.
"
,,
3,4,"Whatever he gets is too good for him.
"
,,
3,4,"Dear Stewie, I want you to know
"
,,
3,4,"that I blame my father's death
"
,,
3,4,"and my incarceration in this hellhole
"
,,
3,4,"entirely on your awful mother.
"
,,
3,4,"If it takes the rest of my life, I shall see that
"
,,
3,4,"she suffers a slow and painful death. Eliza.
"
,,
3,4,"Excellent. Here, have a look.
"
,,
3,4,"Good. Good.
"
,,
3,5,"""It seems today that all you see
"
,,
3,5,"""Is violence in movies and sex on TV

,,
3,5,"""But where are those

,,
3,5,"good old-fashioned values

"
,,
3,5,"Nice figure eight, Mom.
"
,,
3,5,"Ha! All right!
"
,,
3,5,"OK, Bonnie. One, two, three, push!
"
,,
3,5,"Oh! Ah! Whoa!
"
,,
3,5,"My God! I can walk! It's a mira...!
"
,,
3,5," Sorry, Dad.
"
,,
3,5," Just get the chair.
"
,,
3,5,"Good shot.
"
,,
3,5,"Made my brown eye blue with that one.
"
,,
3,5," Yeah. Next one's coming for your head!
"
,,
3,5," Oh, no! No, help! Oh, help!
"
,,
3,5," What the hell?
"
,,
3,5," Now is the winter of your discontent!
"
,,
3,5,"You wanna race? On your mark, get set, go!
"
,,
3,5,"First to where
"
,,
3,5,"that Pakistani girl fell through the ice
"
,,
3,5,"after coming to the States
"
,,
3,5,"for her severely burned face
"
,,
3,5,"she got when the man she refused to marry
"
,,
3,5,"dumped sulphuric acid on her, wins. I win!
"
,,
3,5,"Yes! Yes! In your face! In your face!
"
,,
3,5,"In my face! In my face!
"
,,
3,5,"Ahh! No! Acid girl! It's acid girl! Ahh!
"
,,
3,5," James Woods High! Whoo!
"
,,
3,5," Hey, guys.
"
,,
3,5," What do you want?
"
,,
3,5," I'm trying out for cheerleading.
"
,,
3,5,"Peter Rabbit would be wise
"
,,
3,5,"to stay out of Mr McGregor's garden.
"
,,
3,5,"Why don't you try the flag girls squad?
"
,,
3,5,"Are you trying out for flag girl?
"
,,
3,5,"Yes! I win again, Andy.
"
,,
3,5,"One more before
"
,,
3,5,"the missus notices I'm not on the couch.
"
,,
3,5,"Too late!
"
,,
3,5,"Hey, careful, Quagmire.
"
,,
3,5,"Don't get too close to that thing.
"
,,
3,5,"Did I just get laid?
"
,,
3,5," Nice game, Peter.
"
,,
3,5," I'm on a roll.
"
,,
3,5," I whipped Chris on the ice today.
"
,,
3,5," Enjoy it while it lasts.
"
,,
3,5,"It's only a matter of time
"
,,
3,5,"before he beats you.
"
,,
3,5,"What? I'm better than him at everything:
"
,,
3,5,"Sports, video games, even magic tricks.
"
,,
3,5," Ha-ha. Got your nose.
"
,,
3,5," Oh, yeah? Well, I got your face.
"
,,
3,5,"Calm down, Chris. It's only a trick.
"
,,
3,5,"Face it, sooner or later
"
,,
3,5,"you'll have to pass the torch.
"
,,
3,5,"I remember the first time
"
,,
3,5,"Kevin beat me. I was so proud,
"
,,
3,5,"I gave him a little congratulatory
"
,,
3,5,"punch in the arm. Then another.
"
,,
3,5,"Then everything got hazy. Kevin went
"
,,
3,5,"to live with a foster family for a while...
"
,,
3,5," It's inevitable.
"
,,
3,5," Don't feel bad.
"
,,
3,5,"I think I know why your son beat you.
"
,,
3,5,"Apparently, you're
"
,,
3,5,"a 12-year-old prepubescent girl.
"
,,
3,5,"Which is good, cos I finally have someone
"
,,
3,5,"to give this training bra to. Here, Josephina.
"
,,
3,5,"Does it feel good
"
,,
3,5,"on your new budding bosoms?
"
,,
3,5," It sure does...
"
,,
3,5," Get the hell off me!
"
,,
3,5,"Rudolph, we figured out
"
,,
3,5,"what makes your nose red.
"
,,
3,5," Is it pixie dust or leprechaun tails?
"
,,
3,5," No, it's a tumour.
"
,,
3,5,"You mean like
"
,,
3,5,"a magical Christmas tumour?
"
,,
3,5,"No, a malignant tumour, the base of which
"
,,
3,5,"is lodged deep within your brain.
"
,,
3,5," Oh. Like a happy special...
"
,,
3,5," You're going to die.
"
,,
3,5,"Hey, everybody, guess what I am.
"
,,
3,5,"The end result of a drunken backseat
"
,,
3,5,"gropefest and a broken prophylactic?
"
,,
3,5," I'm on the flag girl squad!
"
,,
3,5," Oh, honey, congratulations.
"
,,
3,5," Hey, Chris. I bet you can't do this.
"
,,
3,5," I bet I can!
"
,,
3,5,"We perform at all the football games.
"
,,
3,5,"I'm practically a cheerleader!
"
,,
3,5,"That's wonderful. Isn't that wonderful?
"
,,
3,5,"Way to go, Stewie. Chris, I'll see
"
,,
3,5,"your fork and raise you a gravy ladle.
"
,,
3,5,"You're on!
"
,,
3,5,"So, you're a flag girl. That's great, Meg.
"
,,
3,5,"Yes, yes.
"
,,
3,5,"Now you can be somewhere else
"
,,
3,5,"when the boys don't call.
"
,,
3,5," All right. Salt shaker up the nose.
"
,,
3,5," I got pepper.
"
,,
3,5,"Ha-ha! Yes! I win!
"
,,
3,5," That was fun, Dad!
"
,,
3,5," I'm the man!
"
,,
3,5,"Yeah! Ahh!
"
,,
3,5,"Lois, go get the medical dictionary
"
,,
3,5,"and look up ""fork"" and ""lung. ""
"
,,
3,5," Why?
"
,,
3,5," Time's a factor, Lois.
"
,,
3,5,"Say, Meg, looking sharp.
"
,,
3,5,"You want to go out after the game tonight?
"
,,
3,5,"Neil, I'm a flag girl now.
"
,,
3,5,"I'm way too cool to be seen with you.
"
,,
3,5,"Really? Not even
"
,,
3,5,"if I smoke this corncob pipe?
"
,,
3,5,"Are we all ready to cheer
"
,,
3,5,"at the game tonight?
"
,,
3,5,"""We?"" Oh, you made flag girl, huh?
"
,,
3,5,"Yeah. This morning my mom
"
,,
3,5,"was, like, ""Don't forget your lunch"",
"
,,
3,5,"and I'm all ""I'm a flag girl now,
"
,,
3,5,"I won't forget my lunch"",
"
,,
3,5,"and she's all
"
,,
3,5,"""Don't forget your halftime routine. ""
"
,,
3,5,"Moms! Hey, maybe we could all,
"
,,
3,5,"like, hang out after the game.
"
,,
3,5,"Go, team!
"
,,
3,5,"Uncool people are like animals.
"
,,
3,5,"You want to go feed
"
,,
3,5,"the science club after school?
"
,,
3,5,"Look at me.
"
,,
3,5,"Look at me, I'm smoking.
"
,,
3,5,"Dog, dog, look, look...
"
,,
3,5,"Alcohol doesn't really make you warmer.
"
,,
3,5,"It constricts the blood vessels...
"
,,
3,5," Shut up.
"
,,
3,5," The dog just told me to shut up.
"
,,
3,5,"I demand to know
"
,,
3,5,"what you plan to do about this. Hey!
"
,,
3,5," Hey! The dog just told me...
"
,,
3,5," Be quiet, Stewie.
"
,,
3,5," Freezing my nips off out here.
"
,,
3,5," Oh, look, there's Meg.
"
,,
3,5,"Meg! Meg! Meg!
"
,,
3,5," Hi, Meg.
"
,,
3,5," Hi, Meg.
"
,,
3,5,"Here we go.
"
,,
3,5," Isn't she beautiful?
"
,,
3,5," Yeah, but I think she's with that guy.
"
,,
3,5," They've held hands all night.
"
,,
3,5," I mean Meg.
"
,,
3,5,"Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah, she's hot.
"
,,
3,5," Oh! This meat stinks something fierce!
"
,,
3,5," This'll knock her down a couple notches.
"
,,
3,5,"Yea, Meg! Oh, man, I love how
"
,,
3,5,"these kids celebrate these days!
"
,,
3,5,"What do you got? What do you got?
"
,,
3,5,"Huh? Huh? Come on.
"
,,
3,5," Come on, ref. That's charging.
"
,,
3,5," Your feet were moving. No foul.
"
,,
3,5,"No foul?! Oh, that's a stupid call!
"
,,
3,5,"And I know something about stupid calls.
"
,,
3,5,"Hello?
"
,,
3,5,"I can't take out the garbage. I'm at
"
,,
3,5,"the office and they're making me stay late.
"
,,
3,5,"Caller ID says you're
"
,,
3,5,"calling from the kitchen.
"
,,
3,5," In fact, I can see you.
"
,,
3,5," Can you see me now?
"
,,
3,5," No.
"
,,
3,5," Now I'm at the office.
"
,,
3,5,"Score's tied, next basket wins.

"

3,5,"""Old man""? I'm the white Larry Bird.
"
,,
3,5,"What do you got?
"
,,
3,5,"What do you got? Huh? Come on!
"
,,
3,5," Your mother and I are getting a divorce!
"
,,
3,5," You are?
"
,,
3,5,"Yes! Yes! Oh, no, we worked it out.
"
,,
3,5,"Yes!
"
,,
3,5,"Son, you played good,
"
,,
3,5,"but your dad is still number one.
"
,,
3,5," Yeah, I don't think I'll ever beat you.
"
,,
3,5," Hey, Chris, what's with your leg?
"
,,
3,5,"Oh, my God! That's not your leg!
"
,,
3,5," What's wrong, honey?
"
,,
3,5," I'll tell you:
"
,,
3,5,"I try to make love to you
"
,,
3,5,"and you think about Chris.
"
,,
3,5," Is there something you need to tell me?
"
,,
3,5," Thanks to you, our son has a huge wang.
"
,,
3,5," Thanks to me?
"
,,
3,5," He didn't get it from me.
"
,,
3,5," What are you talking about?
"
,,
3,5," I'll show you.
"
,,
3,5,"All right, stand back, Lois.
"
,,
3,5,"Oh, my. No wonder he's always slouching.
"
,,
3,5,"How did this happen?
"
,,
3,5,"I'm supposed to be the man of the house.
"
,,
3,5," You must be ashamed of me.
"
,,
3,5," Oh, Peter.
"
,,
3,5,"I care as much about the size of your penis
"
,,
3,5,"as you care about the size of my breasts.
"
,,
3,5,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,5,"You can't let those awful kids get to you.
"
,,
3,5,"They won't. I'm never
"
,,
3,5,"going back to that school again.
"
,,
3,5," Dad, could you help me with my algebra?
"
,,
3,5," You're a big man. You figure it out.
"
,,
3,5,"I bet there's a part of you
"
,,
3,5,"that wants to be friends with them.
"
,,
3,5," Maybe.
"
,,
3,5," So be nice to them.
"
,,
3,5,"Win your enemies over
"
,,
3,5,"with unflappable kindness.
"
,,
3,5," Chris, drink your milk. It'll make you big.
"
,,
3,5," No! No more milk for him.
"
,,
3,5,"He's had enough. Give me that.
"
,,
3,5,"Megan, you must try the brisket. I'll serve it
"
,,
3,5,"in the manner to which you're accustomed.
"
,,
3,5,"Oh!
"
,,
3,5,"Come talk to me sometime, sweetheart.
"
,,
3,5,"I know what it takes to be cool.
"
,,
3,5,"Oh, yeah. That's the good stuff.
"
,,
3,5," Hi, you guys.
"
,,
3,5," God, it's her.
"
,,
3,5," Look, about the other night...
"
,,
3,5," Oh, that was hilarious.
"
,,
3,5,"I just wish I'd known ahead of time.
"
,,
3,5,"I would've brought potato salad!
"
,,
3,5,"You guys want tomorrow's biology test?
"
,,
3,5," Whoa! How'd you get that?
"
,,
3,5," I spent the night with Mr Burler.
"
,,
3,5,"Ah, the sun's up.
"
,,
3,5,"I'm safe for another night. Thanks, Meg.
"
,,
3,5," Wow, thanks!
"
,,
3,5," See ya.
"
,,
3,5," That was kinda cool.
"
,,
3,5," Yeah.
"
,,
3,5,"I'm bored.
"
,,
3,5,"Wanna go push the janitor,
"
,,
3,5,"knowing he can't legally push us back?
"
,,
3,5," Sure!
"
,,
3,5," OK, cool. Let's go do it.
"
,,
3,5,"Hey, Dad. Look at these little bananas.
"
,,
3,5,"Why, you smug little bastard!
"
,,
3,5,"Peter! Chris, these are plantains.
"
,,
3,5,"And there's nothing wrong with them.
"
,,
3,5,"In fact, a lot of women prefer them
"
,,
3,5,"to normal-size bananas,
"
,,
3,5,"because they're exotic and flavourful
"
,,
3,5,"and very, very special.
"
,,
3,5,"Sure, all the sorority girls are clamouring
"
,,
3,5,"for the plantain section. Stop with this!
"
,,
3,5,"You're overreacting to this Chris stuff.
"
,,
3,5,"I mean, mine goes inside me
"
,,
3,5,"when I stand up. How do you think I feel?
"
,,
3,5," Is Dad mad at me?
"
,,
3,5," Oh, of course not, honey.
"
,,
3,5,"Go pick out a box of cereal and meet me
"
,,
3,5,"at the ten-inches-or-less line. Items!
"
,,
3,5,"Nice, huh? Huh? Yeah. You like this?
"
,,
3,5,"Stop it, Peter. You're embarrassing me.
"
,,
3,5,"Look, I know you're upset, but...
"
,,
3,5," Oh, my God. Where's Stewie?
"
,,
3,5," He's around.
"
,,
3,5,"Let me out of this
"
,,
3,5,"stink-filled corduroy dungeon!
"
,,
3,5," Peter, that's sick!
"
,,
3,5," It's OK. He's outside the underwear.
"
,,
3,5," Enjoy your new car, Mr Griffin.
"
,,
3,5," Thanks, Jim.
"
,,
3,5,"When you pull that thing into your garage,
"
,,
3,5,"does the garage say ""Is it in yet?""
"
,,
3,5,"Don't worry, baby. I'll be gentle.
"
,,
3,5,"Ow. My pride.
"
,,
3,5,"You were right. I was nice to the cool kids
"
,,
3,5,"and they didn't spit on me.
"
,,
3,5,"Connie Demico even
"
,,
3,5,"invited me to her sweet 16.
"
,,
3,5,"Wonderful! What time do we nail
"
,,
3,5,"those snot-nosed punks?!
"
,,
3,5,"Nail them? You told me
"
,,
3,5,"to win them over with kindness.
"
,,
3,5,"Yes. Now that they think you're their friend,
"
,,
3,5,"it's the perfect time to exact your revenge.
"
,,
3,5,"Revenge?
"
,,
3,5,"I'm like one of those bald eagles
"
,,
3,5,"you see on the Discovery Channel:
"
,,
3,5,"Beautiful to look at,
"
,,
3,5,"but mess with one of my chicks
"
,,
3,5,"and I'll use my razor-sharp talons to rip
"
,,
3,5,"your eyes out! Cookies are done.
"
,,
3,5," Who wants chocolate-chip?
"
,,
3,5," I do!
"
,,
3,5,"But keep talking. All this stuff about
"
,,
3,5,"eye-gouging has gotten me all frisky.
"
,,
3,5,"Really. I've got about half a pack
"
,,
3,5,"of Rolaids in my diaper.
"
,,
3,5,"I'm glad you want to join
"
,,
3,5,"the National Gun Association.
"
,,
3,5,"Let me show you around.
"
,,
3,5,"This is our shooting range.
"
,,
3,5,"Here we have our locker room
"
,,
3,5,"with full shower facilities.
"
,,
3,5,"Holy crap! They're all so... small!
"
,,
3,5,"You see, Peter, the way we look at it,
"
,,
3,5,"a man's only as big as the gun he carries.
"
,,
3,5,"Sign me up, and get me
"
,,
3,5,"the biggest freakin' gun you got!
"
,,
3,5," Stewie, you can come out now.
"
,,
3,5," Turn off the light. I'm reading a ghost story.
"
,,
3,5,"Pull!
"
,,
3,5,"Oh, yeah.
"
,,
3,5,"Who's the big man now, huh?
"
,,
3,5," Madonna or Janet Jackson?
"
,,
3,5," Which Janet?
"
,,
3,5," Velvet Rope.
"
,,
3,5," Yeah, that one. Pull!
"
,,
3,5," What the hell are you doing with that?
"
,,
3,5," You want to touch it? Go on.
"
,,
3,5,"Careful. We don't want it to get
"
,,
3,5,"too excited and go off in your hand.
"
,,
3,5,"This is pathetic. All because
"
,,
3,5,"you feel inadequate next to Chris.
"
,,
3,5,"Don't be stupid. I don't need to compete
"
,,
3,5,"with my son or his freakishly large penis.
"
,,
3,5," I'm a freak.
"
,,
3,5," Don't despair.
"
,,
3,5,"Let's hang a tyre on the end of it
"
,,
3,5,"and head on down to the ol' swimming hole.
"
,,
3,5,"Connie Demico's house is two storeys.
"
,,
3,5,"If we set up booby traps here, here...
"
,,
3,5," How'd you get these blueprints?
"
,,
3,5," Oh, your mother has her ways.
"
,,
3,5,"She has her ways.
"
,,
3,5," Can I have those blueprints?
"
,,
3,5," Sure, here you go.
"
,,
3,5,"Now I've put together
"
,,
3,5,"a little flash bomb to create a diversion.
"
,,
3,5,"I used to date
"
,,
3,5,"the pyro guy from Whitesnake.
"
,,
3,5,"What's Whitesnake?
"
,,
3,5,"That's the music mommies and daddies
"
,,
3,5,"listen to. Fire in the hole!
"
,,
3,5,"Some guys from the club
"
,,
3,5,"are going hunting tomorrow.
"
,,
3,5," Count me in.
"
,,
3,5," Hunting?
"
,,
3,5," You were gonna play hockey with Chris.
"
,,
3,5," Bring him along.
"
,,
3,5," Oh, no. It's too dangerous.
"
,,
3,5," Lois, Lois.
"
,,
3,5,"The National Gun Association is all about
"
,,
3,5,"safety, especially when it comes to kids.
"

3,5,"Take a look at our new video.
"
,,
3,5,"Let's face it, your kids will get
"

"
,,
3,5,"Gun accidents can be avoided by
"

3,5,"introducing your children to guns early.
"
,,
3,5,"Hi! I'm Petey the pistol.
"
,,
3,5,"Say, do you ever get lonely?
"
,,
3,5," Yes.
"
,,
3,5," Me, too. Hold me.
"
,,
3,5,"If you squeeze me,
"
,,
3,5,"I make bad people go away.
"
,,
3,5,"But wait a minute.
"
,,
3,5,"I thought guns were bad.
"
,,
3,5,"False! Guns are good.
"
,,
3,5,"In fact, did you know that Jesus and Moses
"
,,
3,5,"used guns to conquer the Romans?
"
,,
3,5,"So remember: Guns don't kill people,
"
,,
3,5,"dangerous minorities do.
"
,,
3,5,"See, Lois? They're responsible.
"
,,
3,5,"Hey. Hey, check it out, Chris.
"
,,
3,5,"I can write my name in the snow.
"
,,
3,5," This is fun, Dad.
"
,,
3,5," Son, son, I told you.
"
,,
3,5,"Out here in the wilderness,
"
,,
3,5,"call me Rooster Cogburn.
"
,,
3,5,"I was starting to think
"
,,
3,5,"you didn't like me any more.
"
,,
3,5,"Shh. Chris, look! Tracks.
"
,,
3,5,"There must be a deer around here.
"
,,
3,5," Those are snowmobile tracks.
"
,,
3,5," Shh! There he is.
"
,,
3,5,"Such grace. That's the thing
"
,,
3,5,"about hunting - you gotta be patient.
"
,,
3,5,"What the hell was that?!
"
,,
3,5,"Put this in the heating grate
"
,,
3,5,"and set it off in five minutes.
"
,,
3,5,"I changed my mind. I won't do it.
"
,,
3,5," They're my friends now.
"
,,
3,5," They pelted you with meat.
"
,,
3,5,"Did you forget the neighbour kids
"
,,
3,5,"chased you and sprinkled you with fixings?
"
,,
3,5,"Yes, I did!
"
,,
3,5,"OK. Now we're gonna play
"
,,
3,5,"Seven Minutes in Heaven,
"
,,
3,5,"and it's my party, so I want Doug
"
,,
3,5,"to go in the closet with... Meg.
"
,,
3,5,"Have fun.
"
,,
3,5,"OK. Everyone get ready.
"
,,
3,5,"Say hello to the lovers.
"
,,
3,5,"I don't know who should be
"
,,
3,5,"more humiliated, Meg or the pig.
"
,,
3,5," She's such a dork.
"
,,
3,5," I think I feel worse for the pig.
"
,,
3,5,"Mom, you were right!
"
,,
3,5,"I should have just stuck to the plan!
"
,,
3,5,"I figured you might get soft on me,
"
,,
3,5,"so I hired an old friend to scar them for life.
"
,,
3,5," Hey there, sweetie. How old are you?
"
,,
3,5," 16.
"
,,
3,5," 18?! You're first.
"
,,
3,5," Mom!
"
,,
3,5,"I like where this is going.
"
,,
3,5,"Giggidy-giggidy-good-goody.
"
,,
3,5,"Don't worry, Chris, I'll handle the bear.
"
,,
3,5,"Say hello to Satan for me!
"
,,
3,5,"It's a boy, Mrs Griffin.
"
,,
3,5,"I'm afraid the fever
"
,,
3,5,"has affected his motor skills.
"
,,
3,5,"He's gonna have to repeat the fourth grade.
"
,,
3,5,"Looks like he'll have to repeat
"
,,
3,5,"the fourth grade, Mrs Griffin.
"
,,
3,5,"The only way to get rid of them
"
,,
3,5,"is with this shampoo and a tiny comb.
"
,,
3,5,"Congratulations.
"
,,
3,5,"You've passed the fourth grade.
"
,,
3,5,"Great. I gotta leave though.
"
,,
3,5,"I'm going hunting with my son.
"
,,
3,5,"Dad, I know what to do!
"
,,
3,5,"I saw it on Fox's When Bears Attack!
"
,,
3,5,"Go away! Go on, get!
"
,,
3,5,"Stay tuned for an all-new Ally McBeal!
"
,,
3,5,"Holy crap! Chris, that was amazing.
"
,,
3,5,"I mean, I just froze up.
"
,,
3,5,"But you handled that bear like a real man.
"
,,
3,5,"I'm proud of you, son.
"
,,
3,5,"You are? Because I heard
"
,,
3,5,"what you said about my huge... you know.
"
,,
3,5,"Oh. Oh, you heard that, huh?
"
,,
3,5,"I was just being stupid. Take it from me,
"
,,
3,5,"that thing you got there is a blessing.
"
,,
3,5,"I mean, every guy you see with a big house
"
,,
3,5,"or a fancy car or a shiny gold tooth
"
,,
3,5,"is really just saying
"
,,
3,5,"""Don't look at my penis. ""
"
,,
3,5," But you'll never have to worry about that.
"
,,
3,5," Thanks, Dad! You're the best.
"

3,5,"You know, Dad, I just realised something.
"

3,5," I whipped Chris on the ice today.
"

3,5," Enjoy it while it lasts.
"
,,
3,5,"It's only a matter of time
"
,,
3,5,"before he beats you.
"
,,
3,5,"What? I'm better than him at everything:
"
,,
3,5,"Sports, video games, even magic tricks.
"
,,
3,5," Ha-ha. Got your nose.
"
,,
3,5," Oh, yeah? Well, I got your face.
"
,,
3,5,"Calm down, Chris. It's only a trick.
"
,,
3,5,"Face it, sooner or later
"
,,
3,5,"you'll have to pass the torch.

3,5,"I remember the first time
"
,,
3,5,"Kevin beat me. I was so proud,
"
,,
3,5,"I gave him a little congratulatory
"

3,5,"punch in the arm. Then another.

"

3,5,"Apparently, you're
"

3,5,"a 12-year-old prepubescent girl.
"
,,
3,5,"Which is good, cos I finally have someone

3,5,"to give this training bra to. Here, Josephina.

3,5," All right. Salt shaker up the nose.
"
,,
3,5," I got pepper.
"
,,
3,5,"Ha-ha! Yes! I win!
"
,,
3,5," That was fun, Dad!
"
,,
3,5," I'm the man!
"
,,
3,5,"Yeah! Ahh!
"
,,
3,5,"Lois, go get the medical dictionary
"
,,
3,5,"and look up ""fork"" and ""lung. ""
"
,,
3,5," Why?
"
,,
3,5," Time's a factor, Lois.
"
,,
3,5,"Say, Meg, looking sharp.
"
,,
3,5,"You want to go out after the game tonight?
"
,,
3,5,"Neil, I'm a flag girl now.
"
,,
3,5,"I'm way too cool to be seen with you.
"
,,
3,5,"Really? Not even
"
,,
3,5,"if I smoke this corncob pipe?
"
,,
3,5,"Are we all ready to cheer
"
,,
3,5,"at the game tonight?
"
,,
3,5,"""We?"" Oh, you made flag girl, huh?
"
,,
3,5,"Yeah. This morning my mom
"
,,
3,5,"was, like, ""Don't forget your lunch"",
"
,,
3,5,"and I'm all ""I'm a flag girl now,
"
,,
3,5,"I won't forget my lunch"",
"
,,
3,5,"and she's all
"
,,
3,5,"""Don't forget your halftime routine. ""
"
,,
3,5,"Moms! Hey, maybe we could all,
"
,,
3,5,"like, hang out after the game.
"
,,
3,5,"Go, team!
"
,,
3,5,"Uncool people are like animals.
"
,,
3,5,"You want to go feed
"
,,
3,5,"the science club after school?
"
,,
3,5,"Look at me.
"
,,
3,5,"Look at me, I'm smoking.
"
,,
3,5,"Dog, dog, look, look...
"
,,
3,5,"Alcohol doesn't really make you warmer.
"
,,
3,5,"It constricts the blood vessels...
"
,,
3,5," Shut up.
"
,,
3,5," The dog just told me to shut up.
"
,,
3,5,"I demand to know
"
,,
3,5,"what you plan to do about this. Hey!
"
,,
3,5," Hey! The dog just told me...
"
,,
3,5," Be quiet, Stewie.
"
,,
3,5," Freezing my nips off out here.
"
,,
3,5," Oh, look, there's Meg.
"
,,
3,5,"Meg! Meg! Meg!
"
,,
3,5," Hi, Meg.
"
,,
3,5," Hi, Meg.
"
,,
3,5,"Here we go.
"
,,
3,5," Isn't she beautiful?
"
,,
3,5," Yeah, but I think she's with that guy.
"
,,
3,5," They've held hands all night.
"
,,
3,5," I mean Meg.
"
,,
3,5,"Oh. Oh, yeah. Yeah, she's hot.
"
,,
3,5," Oh! This meat stinks something fierce!
"
,,
3,5," This'll knock her down a couple notches.
"
,,
3,5,"Yea, Meg! Oh, man, I love how
"
,,
3,5,"these kids celebrate these days!
"
,,
3,5,"What do you got? What do you got?
"
,,
3,5,"Huh? Huh? Come on.
"
,,
3,5," Come on, ref. That's charging.
"
,,
3,5," Your feet were moving. No foul.
"
,,
3,5,"No foul?! Oh, that's a stupid call!
"
,,
3,5,"And I know something about stupid calls.
"
,,
3,5,"Hello?
"
,,
3,5,"I can't take out the garbage. I'm at
"
,,
3,5,"the office and they're making me stay late.
"
,,
3,5,"Caller ID says you're
"
,,
3,5,"calling from the kitchen.
"
,,
3,5," In fact, I can see you.
"
,,
3,5," Can you see me now?
"
,,
3,5," No.
"
,,
3,5," Now I'm at the office.
"
,,
3,5,"Score's tied, next basket wins.
"
,,
3,5,"You might finally beat your old man.
"
,,
3,5,"""Old man""? I'm the white Larry Bird.
"
,,
3,5,"What do you got?
"
,,
3,5,"What do you got? Huh? Come on!
"
,,
3,5," Your mother and I are getting a divorce!
"
,,
3,5," You are?
"
,,
3,5,"Yes! Yes! Oh, no, we worked it out.
"
,,
3,5,"Yes!
"
,,
3,5,"Son, you played good,
"
,,
3,5,"but your dad is still number one.
"
,,
3,5," Yeah, I don't think I'll ever beat you.
"
,,
3,5," Hey, Chris, what's with your leg?
"
,,
3,5,"Oh, my God! That's not your leg!
"
,,
3,5," What's wrong, honey?
"
,,
3,5," I'll tell you:
"
,,
3,5,"I try to make love to you
"
,,
3,5,"and you think about Chris.
"
,,
3,5," Is there something you need to tell me?
"
,,
3,5," Thanks to you, our son has a huge wang.
"
,,
3,5," Thanks to me?
"
,,
3,5," He didn't get it from me.
"
,,
3,5," What are you talking about?
"
,,
3,5," I'll show you.
"
,,
3,5,"All right, stand back, Lois.
"
,,
3,5,"Oh, my. No wonder he's always slouching.
"
,,
3,5,"How did this happen?
"
,,
3,5,"I'm supposed to be the man of the house.
"
,,
3,5," You must be ashamed of me.
"
,,
3,5," Oh, Peter.
"
,,
3,5,"I care as much about the size of your penis
"
,,
3,5,"as you care about the size of my breasts.
"
,,
3,5,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,5,"You can't let those awful kids get to you.
"
,,
3,5,"They won't. I'm never
"
,,
3,5,"going back to that school again.
"
,,
3,5," Dad, could you help me with my algebra?
"
,,
3,5," You're a big man. You figure it out.
"
,,
3,5,"I bet there's a part of you
"
,,
3,5,"that wants to be friends with them.
"
,,
3,5," Maybe.
"
,,
3,5," So be nice to them.
"
,,
3,5,"Win your enemies over
"
,,
3,5,"with unflappable kindness.
"
,,
3,5," Chris, drink your milk. It'll make you big.
"
,,
3,5," No! No more milk for him.
"
,,
3,5,"He's had enough. Give me that.
"
,,
3,5,"Megan, you must try the brisket. I'll serve it
"
,,
3,5,"in the manner to which you're accustomed.
"
,,
3,5,"Oh!
"
,,
3,5,"Come talk to me sometime, sweetheart.
"
,,
3,5,"I know what it takes to be cool.
"
,,
3,5,"Oh, yeah. That's the good stuff.
"
,,
3,5," Hi, you guys.
"
,,
3,5," God, it's her.
"
,,
3,5," Look, about the other night...
"
,,
3,5," Oh, that was hilarious.
"
,,
3,5,"I just wish I'd known ahead of time.
"
,,
3,5,"I would've brought potato salad!
"
,,
3,5,"You guys want tomorrow's biology test?
"
,,
3,5," Whoa! How'd you get that?
"
,,
3,5," I spent the night with Mr Burler.
"
,,
3,5,"Ah, the sun's up.
"
,,
3,5,"I'm safe for another night. Thanks, Meg.
"
,,
3,5," Wow, thanks!
"
,,
3,5," See ya.
"
,,
3,5," That was kinda cool.
"
,,
3,5," Yeah.
"
,,
3,5,"I'm bored.
"
,,
3,5,"Wanna go push the janitor,
"
,,
3,5,"knowing he can't legally push us back?
"
,,
3,5," Sure!
"
,,
3,5," OK, cool. Let's go do it.
"
,,
3,5,"Hey, Dad. Look at these little bananas.
"
,,
3,5,"Why, you smug little bastard!
"
,,
3,5,"Peter! Chris, these are plantains.
"
,,
3,5,"And there's nothing wrong with them.
"
,,
3,5,"In fact, a lot of women prefer them
"
,,
3,5,"to normal-size bananas,
"
,,
3,5,"because they're exotic and flavourful
"
,,
3,5,"and very, very special.
"
,,
3,5,"Sure, all the sorority girls are clamouring
"
,,
3,5,"for the plantain section. Stop with this!
"
,,
3,5,"You're overreacting to this Chris stuff.
"
,,
3,5,"I mean, mine goes inside me
"
,,
3,5,"when I stand up. How do you think I feel?
"
,,
3,5," Is Dad mad at me?
"
,,
3,5," Oh, of course not, honey.
"
,,
3,5,"Go pick out a box of cereal and meet me
"
,,
3,5,"at the ten-inches-or-less line. Items!
"
,,
3,5,"Nice, huh? Huh? Yeah. You like this?
"
,,
3,5,"Stop it, Peter. You're embarrassing me.
"
,,
3,5,"Look, I know you're upset, but...
"
,,
3,5," Oh, my God. Where's Stewie?
"
,,
3,5," He's around.
"
,,
3,5,"Let me out of this
"
,,
3,5,"stink-filled corduroy dungeon!
"
,,
3,5," Peter, that's sick!
"
,,
3,5," It's OK. He's outside the underwear.
"
,,
3,5," Enjoy your new car, Mr Griffin.
"
,,
3,5," Thanks, Jim.
"
,,
3,5,"When you pull that thing into your garage,
"
,,
3,5,"does the garage say ""Is it in yet?""
"
,,
3,5,"Don't worry, baby. I'll be gentle.
"
,,
3,5,"Ow. My pride.
"
,,
3,5,"You were right. I was nice to the cool kids
"
,,
3,5,"and they didn't spit on me.
"
,,
3,5,"Connie Demico even
"
,,
3,5,"invited me to her sweet 16.
"
,,
3,5,"Wonderful! What time do we nail
"
,,
3,5,"those snot-nosed punks?!
"
,,
3,5,"Nail them? You told me
"
,,
3,5,"to win them over with kindness.
"
,,
3,5,"Yes. Now that they think you're their friend,
"
,,
3,5,"it's the perfect time to exact your revenge.
"
,,
3,5,"Revenge?
"
,,
3,5,"I'm like one of those bald eagles
"
,,
3,5,"you see on the Discovery Channel:
"
,,
3,5,"Beautiful to look at,
"
,,
3,5,"but mess with one of my chicks
"
,,
3,5,"and I'll use my razor-sharp talons to rip
"
,,
3,5,"your eyes out! Cookies are done.
"
,,
3,5," Who wants chocolate-chip?
"
,,
3,5," I do!
"
,,
3,5,"But keep talking. All this stuff about
"
,,
3,5,"eye-gouging has gotten me all frisky.
"
,,
3,5,"Really. I've got about half a pack
"
,,
3,5,"of Rolaids in my diaper.
"
,,
3,5,"I'm glad you want to join
"
,,
3,5,"the National Gun Association.
"
,,
3,5,"Let me show you around.
"
,,
3,5,"This is our shooting range.
"
,,
3,5,"Here we have our locker room
"
,,
3,5,"with full shower facilities.
"
,,
3,5,"Holy crap! They're all so... small!
"
,,
3,5,"You see, Peter, the way we look at it,
"
,,
3,5,"a man's only as big as the gun he carries.
"
,,
3,5,"Sign me up, and get me
"
,,
3,5,"the biggest freakin' gun you got!
"
,,
3,5," Stewie, you can come out now.
"
,,
3,5," Turn off the light. I'm reading a ghost story.
"
,,
3,5,"Pull!
"
,,
3,5,"Oh, yeah.
"
,,
3,5,"Who's the big man now, huh?
"
,,
3,5," Madonna or Janet Jackson?
"
,,
3,5," Which Janet?
"
,,
3,5," Velvet Rope.
"
,,
3,5," Yeah, that one. Pull!
"
,,
3,5," What the hell are you doing with that?
"
,,
3,5," You want to touch it? Go on.
"
,,
3,5,"Careful. We don't want it to get
"
,,
3,5,"too excited and go off in your hand.
"
,,
3,5,"This is pathetic. All because
"
,,
3,5,"you feel inadequate next to Chris.
"
,,
3,5,"Don't be stupid. I don't need to compete
"
,,
3,5,"with my son or his freakishly large penis.
"
,,
3,5," I'm a freak.
"
,,
3,5," Don't despair.
"
,,
3,5,"Let's hang a tyre on the end of it
"
,,
3,5,"and head on down to the ol' swimming hole.
"
,,
3,5,"Connie Demico's house is two storeys.
"
,,
3,5,"If we set up booby traps here, here...
"
,,
3,5," How'd you get these blueprints?
"
,,
3,5," Oh, your mother has her ways.
"
,,
3,5,"She has her ways.
"
,,
3,5," Can I have those blueprints?
"
,,
3,5," Sure, here you go.
"
,,
3,5,"Now I've put together
"
,,
3,5,"a little flash bomb to create a diversion.
"
,,
3,5,"I used to date
"
,,
3,5,"the pyro guy from Whitesnake.
"
,,
3,5,"What's Whitesnake?
"
,,
3,5,"That's the music mommies and daddies
"
,,
3,5,"listen to. Fire in the hole!
"
,,
3,5,"Some guys from the club
"
,,
3,5,"are going hunting tomorrow.
"
,,
3,5," Count me in.
"
,,
3,5," Hunting?
"
,,
3,5," You were gonna play hockey with Chris.
"
,,
3,5," Bring him along.
"
,,
3,5," Oh, no. It's too dangerous.
"
,,
3,5," Lois, Lois.
"
,,
3,5,"The National Gun Association is all about
"
,,
3,5,"safety, especially when it comes to kids.

"

"

3,5,"Hi! I'm Petey the pistol.
"
,,
3,5,"Say, do you ever get lonely?
"
,,
3,5," Yes.
"
,,
3,5," Me, too. Hold me.
"
,,
3,5,"If you squeeze me,
"
,,
3,5,"I make bad people go away.
"
,,
3,5,"But wait a minute.
"
,,
3,5,"I thought guns were bad.
"
,,
3,5,"False! Guns are good.
"
,,
3,5,"In fact, did you know that Jesus and Moses
"
,,
3,5,"used guns to conquer the Romans?
"
,,
3,5,"So remember: Guns don't kill people,
"
,,
3,5,"dangerous minorities do.
"
,,
3,5,"See, Lois? They're responsible.
"
,,
3,5,"Hey. Hey, check it out, Chris.
"
,,
3,5,"I can write my name in the snow.
"
,,
3,5," This is fun, Dad.
"
,,
3,5," Son, son, I told you.
"
,,
3,5,"Out here in the wilderness,
"
,,
3,5,"call me Rooster Cogburn.
"
,,
3,5,"I was starting to think
"
,,
3,5,"you didn't like me any more.
"
,,
3,5,"Shh. Chris, look! Tracks.
"
,,
3,5,"There must be a deer around here.
"
,,
3,5," Those are snowmobile tracks.
"
,,
3,5," Shh! There he is.
"
,,
3,5,"Such grace. That's the thing
"
,,
3,5,"about hunting - you gotta be patient.
"
,,
3,5,"What the hell was that?!
"
,,
3,5,"Put this in the heating grate
"
,,
3,5,"and set it off in five minutes.
"
,,
3,5,"I changed my mind. I won't do it.
"
,,
3,5," They're my friends now.
"
,,
3,5," They pelted you with meat.
"
,,
3,5,"Did you forget the neighbour kids
"
,,
3,5,"chased you and sprinkled you with fixings?
"
,,
3,5,"Yes, I did!
"
,,
3,5,"OK. Now we're gonna play
"
,,
3,5,"Seven Minutes in Heaven,
"
,,
3,5,"and it's my party, so I want Doug
"
,,
3,5,"to go in the closet with... Meg.
"
,,
3,5,"Have fun.
"
,,
3,5,"OK. Everyone get ready.
"
,,
3,5,"Say hello to the lovers.
"
,,
3,5,"I don't know who should be
"
,,
3,5,"more humiliated, Meg or the pig.
"
,,
3,5," She's such a dork.
"
,,
3,5," I think I feel worse for the pig.
"
,,
3,5,"Mom, you were right!
"
,,
3,5,"I should have just stuck to the plan!
"
,,
3,5,"I figured you might get soft on me,
"
,,
3,5,"so I hired an old friend to scar them for life.
"
,,
3,5," Hey there, sweetie. How old are you?
"
,,
3,5," 16.
"
,,
3,5," 18?! You're first.
"
,,
3,5," Mom!
"
,,
3,5,"I like where this is going.
"
,,
3,5,"Giggidy-giggidy-good-goody.
"
,,
3,5,"Don't worry, Chris, I'll handle the bear.
"
,,
3,5,"Say hello to Satan for me!
"
,,
3,5,"It's a boy, Mrs Griffin.
"
,,
3,5,"I'm afraid the fever
"
,,
3,5,"has affected his motor skills.
"
,,
3,5,"He's gonna have to repeat the fourth grade.
"
,,
3,5,"Looks like he'll have to repeat
"
,,
3,5,"the fourth grade, Mrs Griffin.
"
,,
3,5,"The only way to get rid of them
"
,,
3,5,"is with this shampoo and a tiny comb.
"
,,
3,5,"Congratulations.
"
,,
3,5,"You've passed the fourth grade.
"
,,
3,5,"Great. I gotta leave though.
"
,,
3,5,"I'm going hunting with my son.
"
,,
3,5,"Dad, I know what to do!
"
,,
3,5,"I saw it on Fox's When Bears Attack!
"
,,
3,5,"Go away! Go on, get!
"
,,
3,5,"Stay tuned for an all-new Ally McBeal!
"
,,
3,5,"Holy crap! Chris, that was amazing.
"
,,
3,5,"I mean, I just froze up.
"
,,
3,5,"But you handled that bear like a real man.
"
,,
3,5,"I'm proud of you, son.
"
,,
3,5,"You are? Because I heard
"
,,
3,5,"what you said about my huge... you know.
"
,,
3,5,"Oh. Oh, you heard that, huh?
"
,,
3,5,"I was just being stupid. Take it from me,
"
,,
3,5,"that thing you got there is a blessing.
"
,,
3,5,"I mean, every guy you see with a big house
"
,,
3,5,"or a fancy car or a shiny gold tooth
"
,,
3,5,"is really just saying
"
,,
3,5,"""Don't look at my penis. ""
"

3,5," But you'll never have to worry about that.
"

3,5," Thanks, Dad! You're the best.

3,6,"that means. Boi-oi-oi-oiing. Gross.
"
,,
3,6,"Hey, fellas. I got us a tee time tomorrow
"
,,
3,6,"at Barrington Country Club.
"
,,
3,6," Barrington? Wow.
"
,,
3,6," I'm in.
"
,,
3,6," Peter, tomorrow's your anniversary.
"
,,
3,6," Oh, crap!
"
,,
3,6,"If Lois finds out I'm ditching her,
"
,,
3,6,"she'll hit me with a frying pan.
"
,,
3,6,"Which is why I'm gonna drink
"
,,
3,6,"this frying pan antidote.
"
,,
3,6,"All right, hit me with this. Didn't work.
"
,,
3,6,"What the hell?
"
,,
3,6,"""Lois, it's an anniversary scavenger hunt. ""
"
,,
3,6,"""Your first clue is at the Quahog Mini-Mart.
"
,,
3,6,"Love, Peter. "" Oh, how fun!
"
,,
3,6,"Before you tee off, here are your
"
,,
3,6,"complimentary monogrammed bag towels,
"
,,
3,6,"a sleeve of balls,
"
,,
3,6,"and this mobile ball cleaner.
"
,,
3,6," Clean as a whistle, sir.
"
,,
3,6," I won't get short by touching your spit?
"
,,
3,6,"You'd be the first, champ.
"
,,
3,6," It's about time.
"
,,
3,6," Sorry, fellas. I'm not gonna be able to play.
"
,,
3,6,"Loretta's mother is in town and we have
"
,,
3,6,"to go buy new sheets for the dog bed.
"
,,
3,6," Cleveland!
"
,,
3,6," I mean the pull-out sofa bed.
"
,,
3,6,"You could be the first black guy to play
"
,,
3,6,"this course. People are gonna be impressed.
"
,,
3,6," Hey, a black guy.
"
,,
3,6," Ooh, fun.
"
,,
3,6," Come on.
"
,,
3,6," Maybe we should play another time.
"
,,
3,6,"Screw that. I busted my ass keeping Lois
"
,,
3,6,"busy so I could be here. Grip it and rip it.
"
,,
3,6,"The fed will be lowering rates, so get
"
,,
3,6,"your money out of T-bills and put it all into...
"
,,
3,6,"Waffles! Tasty waffles with lots of syrup!
"
,,
3,6,"Waffles! Buy waffles!
"
,,
3,6,"Waffles! Waffles! Waffles!
"
,,
3,6,"Waffle! Waffle! Waffle! Waffle!
"
,,
3,6,"OK, kids, keep your eyes peeled for a clue.
"
,,
3,6,"What Jughead has done here -
"
,,
3,6,"and it's quite ingenious actually -
"
,,
3,6,"is paint pupils on his eyelids
"
,,
3,6,"so he can sleep through class
"
,,
3,6,"without Miss Grundy being any the wiser.
"
,,
3,6,"He's sleeping.
"
,,
3,6," Mom, I found Dad's first clue.
"
,,
3,6," I can't believe your father organised this.
"
,,
3,6,"Usually he can't even handle simple tasks.
"
,,
3,6,"Peter, why is there a diaper
"
,,
3,6,"in the lamp socket?
"
,,
3,6,"Lois, he's done it again!
"
,,
3,6,"Wait a minute.
"
,,
3,6,"Ha!
"
,,
3,6," Let's pack it in. There's too much water.
"
,,
3,6," Let's hit the bar.
"
,,
3,6,"Oh, come on. There's worse things
"
,,
3,6,"in life than rain. Like... like spiders.
"
,,
3,6,"He's behind the door!
"
,,
3,6,"Peter, he's bothering
"
,,
3,6,"everyone. Say something.
"
,,
3,6,"I'll kick his ass.
"
,,
3,6,"Someone ought to kick his ass.
"
,,
3,6,"Don't go in there!
"
,,
3,6," Peter!
"
,,
3,6," All right, all right. Give me a Kleenex.
"
,,
3,6,"I knew he was bad. I knew it... Aah!
"
,,
3,6,"Out of me way!
"
,,
3,6,"They're after me Lucky Charms!
"
,,
3,6,"I paid him ten bucks to say it. Classic.
"
,,
3,6," We'll be in the clubhouse.
"
,,
3,6," Go on, run away. More golf course for me.
"
,,
3,6,"That was close. That looks dangerous.
"
,,
3,6,"Somebody's gonna get hurt.
"
,,
3,6,"Ah, it'll be fine.
"
,,
3,6,"You again?!
"
,,
3,6," Death, please don't take me now.
"
,,
3,6," Relax. You're not dying.
"
,,
3,6," You're having a near-death experience.
"
,,
3,6," Thank God!
"
,,
3,6,"Oh, yeah. Thank God I get to hang out
"
,,
3,6,"with a fascinating gent like yourself.
"
,,
3,6," So, when am I gonna die?
"
,,
3,6," Two years after your wife divorces you.
"
,,
3,6,"What are you talking about?
"
,,
3,6,"Lois would never leave me.
"
,,
3,6,"She's been crazy about me
"
,,
3,6,"since the night we met.
"
,,
3,6,"Oh, my God, that's me! Look how thin I was!
"
,,
3,6,"My, this is certainly a beautiful night.
"
,,
3,6,"I love looking at stars.
"
,,
3,6," Say no more.
"
,,
3,6," Peter, wait. I...
"
,,
3,6,"Very interesting... but stupid.
"
,,
3,6,"Oh, my God! I love Arte Johnson!
"
,,
3,6," Then why don't you give him a kiss, huh?
"
,,
3,6," No. Peter, get away from me with that.
"
,,
3,6," Come on. Give Arte Johnson a kiss.
"
,,
3,6," Peter, stop it. I mean it!
"
,,
3,6,"Oh!
"
,,
3,6,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,6,"Oh, Peter, I hear music.
"
,,
3,6,"Yeah, me too.
"
,,
3,6,"From now on, this'll be our song.
"
,,
3,6,"Ow!
"
,,
3,6,"I've never met a guy like you.
"
,,
3,6,"You're so full of life.
"
,,
3,6,"It's like I can really be myself
"
,,
3,6,"with you. I'm so happy.
"
,,
3,6," Oh, man, she was beautiful.
"
,,
3,6," This looks awfully familiar.
"
,,
3,6,"Wait a second. I remember this.
"
,,
3,6,"That's me! Look at all that hair.
"
,,
3,6,"I can't believe I thought that looked good.
"
,,
3,6,"I must've been high.
"
,,
3,6," I love you, Lois Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
3,6," I love you, Peter Griffin.
"
,,
3,6,"Look at that. Huh? Huh?
"
,,
3,6,"There's no way she's gonna leave me.
"
,,
3,6,"Now put me back in my freakin' body.
"
,,
3,6,"I can't until you have a revelation.
"
,,
3,6,"One of those things that changes your life.
"
,,
3,6,"The hell with this. I'm going home.
"
,,
3,6," You can't get in that way.
"
,,
3,6," I'm sure as hell not going in the back door.
"
,,
3,6,"Oh, crap. I don't have time for this.
"
,,
3,6,"Listen, I'm late for an appointment.
"
,,
3,6,"If you don't want to follow
"
,,
3,6,"procedure, fine. Stay in limbo.
"
,,
3,6,"No, no, wait, wait.
"
,,
3,6,"I don't want to be in limbo.
"
,,
3,6,"OK. It says the next note
"
,,
3,6,"will be right under my nose.
"
,,
3,6,"They're off!
"
,,
3,6,"And quick out in front, Silver Dasher,
"
,,
3,6,"followed by My Nose!
"
,,
3,6,"Aha! Hold my purse!
"
,,
3,6," What's Mom doing?
"
,,
3,6," She's screwing up my six-two quinella.
"
,,
3,6,"My Nose out in front,
"
,,
3,6,"followed by Sea Biscuit,
"
,,
3,6,"followed by Some Crazy Lady
"
,,
3,6,"and Middle-Aged Housewife,
"
,,
3,6,"followed by Wait a Minute, Who's That
"
,,
3,6,"and Silver Dasher.
"
,,
3,6,"And now it appears there's
"
,,
3,6,"a woman chasing the dogs.
"
,,
3,6," Let's go, kids!
"
,,
3,6," Tell the boys in Kansas City the bet's off.
"
,,
3,6,"Too late, Stewie. The fix is in
"
,,
3,6,"and the noodles are boiling in the pot.
"
,,
3,6,"Wait, I got it. I figured out my revelation.
"
,,
3,6," God loves a working man.
"
,,
3,6," No!
"
,,
3,6,"The Shadow is in reality Lamont Cranston,
"
,,
3,6,"wealthy young man.
"
,,
3,6,"No! Oh, crap! I'm late. I'm in big, big trouble!
"
,,
3,6,"You're shook up about that appointment.
"
,,
3,6,"You're Death. What are you afraid of?
"
,,
3,6,"Where the hell have you been?
"
,,
3,6,"When I said lunch, I said noon, not noonish.
"
,,
3,6," Sorry, Ma.
"
,,
3,6," Is sorry gonna reheat the casserole?
"
,,
3,6," So, who's your friend?
"
,,
3,6," It's a work thing. Near-death experience.
"
,,
3,6," Where are you going?
"
,,
3,6," To take a leak.
"
,,
3,6,"Don't forget to zip up your fly. If you don't
"
,,
3,6,"zip up your fly, a seagull will get ya!
"
,,
3,6,"God, she's a pain in the ass!
"
,,
3,6,"I wish Dad was still dead.
"
,,
3,6,"Oh, yeah. I'll tell you, Lois's dad
"
,,
3,6,"was a pain in the ass when I met him.
"
,,
3,6," Hi. Can I take my tie off yet?
"
,,
3,6," Oh, Peter, you look so wonderful.
"
,,
3,6," You aren't nervous, are you?
"
,,
3,6," You'll know when I'm nervous.
"
,,
3,6," Lois?
"
,,
3,6," Now.
"
,,
3,6,"Take the rap for this. I only get one chance
"
,,
3,6,"to make a first impression.
"
,,
3,6,"Hi, Daddy. That was me. And this is Peter.
"
,,
3,6,"Hey, Mr Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
3,6,"What are you feeding this gal?
"
,,
3,6,"Peter Griffin. Can I take this tie off?
"
,,
3,6,"It's a pleasure.
"
,,
3,6,"My daughter is taken with you.
"
,,
3,6,"And I'm taken with her. I mean, look at her.
"
,,
3,6,"Huh? Show us front and back there, Lois.
"
,,
3,6,"Don't think I don't know
"
,,
3,6,"where that comes from.
"
,,
3,6,"That's world-class juice
"
,,
3,6,"you got brewing in the old flesh balloon.
"
,,
3,6," Eh? Eh? Oh, yeah.
"
,,
3,6," I'm gonna go get my purse.
"
,,
3,6,"Based on what you've seen with your wife,
"
,,
3,6,"what can we expect in terms of droopage?
"
,,
3,6,"Are we talking a slope or full-blown
"
,,
3,6,"fried eggs hanging on a nail?
"
,,
3,6," What do you think of this?
"
,,
3,6," It's nice.
"
,,
3,6," It's Etruscan.
"
,,
3,6," Get out of here.
"
,,
3,6," No, seriously.
"
,,
3,6," Oh, that's great.
"
,,
3,6," Hey, look. A manatee!
"
,,
3,6," We can use it for soup.
"
,,
3,6,"Ensign Glen Quagmire. Welcome aboard.
"
,,
3,6,"You picked a great day to get rescued.
"
,,
3,6,"We were just about to sing
"
,,
3,6,"a song about mopping.
"
,,
3,6,"""We're mopping the deck
"
,,
3,6,"Which is Navy for ""floor""
"
,,
3,6,"""And when we're done mopping
"
,,
3,6,"We'll mop it some more
"
,,
3,6," Oh!
"
,,
3,6," "" Swab means mop, deck means floor...
"
,,
3,6,"Could you tell me when
"
,,
3,6,"you're going back in time?
"
,,
3,6,"I was talking to a robe for 20 minutes
"
,,
3,6,"before I realised you weren't in it.
"
,,
3,6,"Ma, for God's sake,
"
,,
3,6,"leave me alone! I'm working!
"
,,
3,6,"Don't yell at your mother! If you yell at your
"
,,
3,6,"mother, a hen will lay eggs in your tummy.
"
,,
3,6," Brilliantly choreographed.
"
,,
3,6," That's your tax dollars at work.
"
,,
3,6,"Why not join us and see the world?
"
,,
3,6,"Sorry, pal. I've seen the world,
"
,,
3,6,"and its name is Lois.
"
,,
3,6,"How romantic.
"
,,
3,6,"Why can't you find a nice girl?
"
,,
3,6," Ma, she's gonna dump him.
"
,,
3,6," At least he got that far.
"
,,
3,6,"You know who he took
"
,,
3,6,"to the prom? His cousin!
"
,,
3,6," That's weak.
"
,,
3,6," Yeah.
"
,,
3,6,"All right. All right, that's it!
"
,,
3,6,"I'm sick of both of you. Come on, Peter.
"
,,
3,6,"Death, put your jacket on
"
,,
3,6,"or you'll get frostbite!
"
,,
3,6," I don't have skin!
"
,,
3,6," That's cos you didn't eat your beans!
"
,,
3,6,"Come on, come on.
"
,,
3,6,"Get back in your big, fat body.
"
,,
3,6,"Why should I help you save your marriage
"
,,
3,6,"when I can't get a girl?
"
,,
3,6,"Whoa, wait! What are you saying?
"
,,
3,6,"The revelation, jackass! It could have
"
,,
3,6,"helped you save your marriage.
"
,,
3,6,"But too late. Oh, and by the way, when the
"
,,
3,6,"lightning hit you, you soiled yourself. Enjoy.
"
,,
3,6,"Wait, wait. I can't lose Lois!
"
,,
3,6,"Please, I'll do anything.
"
,,
3,6," What if... what if I helped you get a girl?
"
,,
3,6," Really? You think you could do that?
"
,,
3,6,"All we gotta do is get you fixed up.
"
,,
3,6,"Get your hair cut, give you a good, clean...
"
,,
3,6,"...shave, cologne... Chicks'll be all over you.
"
,,
3,6," Gee! You really think so?
"
,,
3,6," Absolutely.
"
,,
3,6,"You got any SPF-50?
"
,,
3,6,"I bleach like a gym sock.
"
,,
3,6,"Death, will you relax? The beach
"
,,
3,6,"is a perfect place to pick up chicks.
"
,,
3,6,"Now, I want you to go over there
"
,,
3,6,"and ask those girls if you can play.
"
,,
3,6," Hey, can I join you?
"
,,
3,6," I guess. What's your name?
"
,,
3,6," Josh.
"
,,
3,6," Do you, like, live around here?
"
,,
3,6,"No. I... I live with my mom.
"
,,
3,6," Let's get out of here
"
,,
3,6," See ya, Josh. Tell your mom we said hi.
"
,,
3,6,"Heads up!
"
,,
3,6,"How do we get up there?
"
,,
3,6,"Dad put grease on the pole.
"
,,
3,6,"Don't worry. We've been
"
,,
3,6,"studying fulcrums in school.
"
,,
3,6,"You have to counterbalance the weight
"
,,
3,6,"at the point where the lever pivots. Like so.
"
,,
3,6,"Stewie, you wanna play rocket ship?
"
,,
3,6," What the deuce?
"
,,
3,6," Blast off! Go on. Get the note for Mommy.
"
,,
3,6,"How dare you use me
"
,,
3,6,"for your own personal selfish... Hmm.
"
,,
3,6,"Oh. Pull slower. I must remember
"
,,
3,6,"to do this game when no one's around.
"
,,
3,6,"What was I thinking? You don't know
"
,,
3,6,"anything about picking up chicks.
"
,,
3,6,"Are you kidding? I learned from the best.
"
,,
3,6,"Come on, buddy.
"
,,
3,6,"We're dropping anchor in Jamaica!
"
,,
3,6," Great! We're closer to Rhode Island.
"
,,
3,6," Rhode Island? Forget that.
"
,,
3,6,"I'm taking you out for shore leave.
"
,,
3,6," Does this look like a ""Q"" to you?
"
,,
3,6," No.
"
,,
3,6," How about now?
"
,,
3,6," Your crotch just looks like Lois to me.
"
,,
3,6,"Let's ask her then. Lois, should Peter
"
,,
3,6,"sit around and mope all night?
"
,,
3,6,"Or should Peter go out with his buddy
"
,,
3,6,"and have some fun?
"
,,
3,6,"All right!
"
,,
3,6,"That one's a feminist type,
"
,,
3,6,"she's into he-men,
"
,,
3,6,"and that one's mad for jazz. Watch this.
"
,,
3,6,"The plight of women is deplorable.
"
,,
3,6,"I can bench-press 800 pounds.
"
,,
3,6,"You, me and Coltrane till dawn.
"
,,
3,6,"There you go, Peter.
"
,,
3,6,"One for you, two for me.
"
,,
3,6,"You guys go on without me.
"
,,
3,6," So why didn't you go with them?
"
,,
3,6," You don't know what it's like in love.
"
,,
3,6,"Oh, yeah? Her name's Amy.
"
,,
3,6,"She works at a pet store.
"
,,
3,6,"I met her last summer when her dad
"
,,
3,6,"hung himself. I was too shy to ask her out.
"
,,
3,6," What's with that moustache?
"
,,
3,6," Let me see that.
"
,,
3,6,"Sorry. That's Edward James Olmos.
"
,,
3,6,"Here, this is her.
"
,,
3,6," Nice ass.
"
,,
3,6," Sorry. That's Edward James Olmos's ass.
"
,,
3,6,"I guess I don't have a photo.
"
,,
3,6,"Trust me, she's cute.
"
,,
3,6,"Let's go get her.
"
,,
3,6," I'll need that picture of Olmos's ass back.
"
,,
3,6," Oh, yeah.
"
,,
3,6,"Mom, hurry! I can't stand the smell!
"
,,
3,6,"I found the note!
"
,,
3,6,"""Go back to the mini-mart""?
"
,,
3,6,"This isn't very creative. Let's go, kids.
"
,,
3,6,"Mom, you remember that goldfish
"
,,
3,6,"we flushed down the toilet?
"
,,
3,6,"He wasn't dead.
"
,,
3,6," There she is. That's her.
"
,,
3,6," All right, go on. Just like we practised.
"
,,
3,6," Hey, you.
"
,,
3,6," Hi. I was just, uh... uh...
"
,,
3,6,"in... in... I was just
"
,,
3,6,"in the neighbourhood and...
"
,,
3,6,"So I thought that, uh... So... You...
"
,,
3,6,"I'll, uh... This is a bad time.
"
,,
3,6,"Maybe I'll just come back.
"
,,
3,6," Who am I kidding? I'll never get her.
"
,,
3,6," Not with that attitude. Come on!
"
,,
3,6,"Robert Reed got Florence Henderson
"
,,
3,6,"and he was a burgermeister.
"
,,
3,6,"You gotta find a way to make it happen.
"
,,
3,6,"So long. I hope you find your girl.
"
,,
3,6,"Thanks, Quagmire.
"
,,
3,6,"Hope you live next door to me someday.
"
,,
3,6,"Hey, does this look like a ""Q"" to you?
"
,,
3,6,"How about now?
"
,,
3,6,"So, where is it that you need to go,
"
,,
3,6,"my new honky friend?
"
,,
3,6,"Rhode Island. That's not too far, is it?
"
,,
3,6,"Nothing's too far away from Maxine,
"
,,
3,6,"the cheatin' queen. Women.
"
,,
3,6,"That's not fair. I'm just speaking out of hurt.
"
,,
3,6,"That truck's coming up on us awful fast.
"
,,
3,6,"Holy crap! Do you see what I see?
"
,,
3,6," I'm afraid I do.
"
,,
3,6," We're being chased by ghosts!
"
,,
3,6,"You went through all this to see your girl?
"
,,
3,6,"I sure did, and I'm a fat idiot.
"
,,
3,6,"What's your excuse, you big chicken?
"
,,
3,6," Chicken? You take that back!
"
,,
3,6," Yeah? Make me!
"
,,
3,6,"I don't make monkeys, I train 'em.
"
,,
3,6," Oh! Holy crap! I'm sorry. Did that hurt?
"
,,
3,6," No. But this will!
"
,,
3,6,"Aah! Aah! You bastard!
"
,,
3,6," What the hell is going on out here?
"
,,
3,6," Actually, I, uh... I, uh...
"
,,
3,6,"Actually, he wanted to ask you something.
"
,,
3,6,"Wanna go somewhere and grab a coffee?
"
,,
3,6," Sure. I get off at two.
"
,,
3,6," Great! Great! I'll meet you here.
"
,,
3,6,"You did it! All right! Hey, who knows?
"
,,
3,6,"You might even, you know...
"
,,
3,6," I'm not following you.
"
,,
3,6," Intercourse.
"
,,
3,6," What are you doing here?
"
,,
3,6," Loretta's mom was hankering for a snack,
"
,,
3,6,"so we had to pick her up
"
,,
3,6,"some Kibbles 'n Bits.
"
,,
3,6," Cleveland!
"
,,
3,6," I mean Cheez-its.
"
,,
3,6," Did Peter give you a clue for me?
"
,,
3,6," Peter?
"
,,
3,6,"He's at Barrington
"
,,
3,6,"with Brian and Quagmire.
"
,,
3,6,"He's golfing? On our anniversary?!
"
,,
3,6,"Oh, boy. You just put Peter in the
"
,,
3,6,"doghouse, which is where your mother...
"
,,
3,6,"Don't say it!
"
,,
3,6,"Your mother smells.
"
,,
3,6,"See, this is why I hate clothes shopping.
"
,,
3,6,"I have no ass. I'm minus an ass.
"
,,
3,6,"You're trying too hard.
"
,,
3,6,"She won't care what you wear.
"
,,
3,6,"She's just gonna be glad to see you.
"
,,
3,6,"That's how it was with Lois.
"
,,
3,6,"Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
"
,,
3,6," Hi, Mr Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
3,6," What are you doing here?
"
,,
3,6,"It's a long story - with terrific performances
"
,,
3,6,"and a wonderful scene in a carnival.
"
,,
3,6,"I'll cut to the ending. I want to marry Lois!
"
,,
3,6,"Out of the question! Now, listen, Griffin.
"
,,
3,6,"I want you to take this
"
,,
3,6,"and stay away from my daughter for ever.
"
,,
3,6," A million dollars?
"
,,
3,6," A million dollars.
"
,,
3,6,"No deal. Lois may be worth a million to you,
"
,,
3,6,"but to me, she's worthless.
"
,,
3,6," I love her, Mr Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
3,6," Oh, Peter!
"
,,
3,6,"Holy crap! Back then I gave up
"
,,
3,6,"a million bucks just to be with Lois.
"
,,
3,6,"Now I won't even miss a golf game
"
,,
3,6,"to spend our anniversary together.
"
,,
3,6," No wonder she's gonna dump me.
"
,,
3,6," Or is she?
"
,,
3,6,"Wait a minute. That's my revelation.
"
,,
3,6,"I gotta pay more attention to my wife!
"
,,
3,6,"Eureka. Now, come on back
"
,,
3,6,"to the golf course. I've got a date.
"
,,
3,6,"Death, wait, wait, wait. Before we go,
"
,,
3,6,"I need you to do me one more favour.
"
,,
3,6,"Peter. Peter Frampton.
"
,,
3,6,"Oh, no! God, please no!
"
,,
3,6,"I'm too young to die!
"
,,
3,6,"Sure you're not supposed
"
,,
3,6,"to get Keith Richards?
"
,,
3,6,"All right. If you want to live, come with me.
"
,,
3,6,"And bring your guitar.
"
,,
3,6,"And bring that thing you use to make it go
"
,,
3,6,"wah... wah-wah-wah-wah-wah.
"
,,
3,6,"Hey! Get out of the way!
"
,,
3,6,"Damn. How could he lie to me
"
,,
3,6,"on our anniversary?
"
,,
3,6," Oh, Peter. Our song.
"
,,
3,6," Happy anniversary, Lois.
"
,,
3,6,"This is the most romantic gift you've ever
"
,,
3,6,"given me. How did you put this together?
"
,,
3,6,"I had a little help...
"
,,
3,6,"from a very special friend.
"
,,
3,6," I like animals.
"
,,
3,6," Uh-huh.
"
,,
3,6,"Cos they're like people, little furry people.
"
,,
3,6,"Yeah... Hey, you ever go on the Internet?
"
,,
3,6,"They got some cool stuff
"
,,
3,6,"there on that Internet.
"
,,
3,6,"I bought these shoes from a company on
"
,,
3,6,"the Internet, cos they don't test on animals.
"
,,
3,6,"Wow.
"
,,
3,6,"You know, animals never have war.
"
,,
3,6,"War is an invention of mankind.
"
,,
3,6,"What the hell are you talking about?
"
,,
3,6,"Animals fight all the time!
"
,,
3,6,"Not with nuclear arms. You can't hug
"
,,
3,6,"your children with nuclear arms.
"
,,
3,6,"Check, please.
"

3,7,"before it went all fun-house mirror.
"
,,
3,7," I can't believe how terrific you look.
"
,,
3,7," I've been taking tae-jitsu classes.
"
,,
3,7," You should come with me sometime.
"
,,
3,7," I'd love to.
"

3,7," Oh! The baby's kicking. Wanna feel?
"
,,
3,7," Sure.
"

3,7," You are freakin' dead, kid.
"

3,7," Peter!
"

3,7," Oh, I love this time of year.
"

3,7," Me, too.
"
,,
3,7,"The tourists are gone and
"
,,
3,7,"we have the town to ourselves
"
,,
3,7,"before those idiots from New York show up
"
,,
3,7,"to watch the leaves change and take over.
"
,,
3,7,"Leafers!
"
,,
3,7,"Holy crap. We gotta get outta here.
"
,,
3,7," What about the boat?
"
,,
3,7," Leave it!
"
,,
3,7," Hurry, Peter. They're almost here.
"
,,
3,7," We're too late.
"
,,
3,7,"Yo, check out those colours. Yellow like
"
,,
3,7,"a taxi, orange like the ball at the Knicks game,
"
,,
3,7,"and red like the sauce
"
,,
3,7,"on my mamma mia's gugotz.
"
,,
3,7,"Yeah, and brown, like the guys
"
,,
3,7,"I don't pick up in my cab.
"
,,
3,7," Bea-utiful!
"
,,
3,7," Aagh!
"
,,
3,7,"Good evening. Tonight's top story:
"
,,
3,7,"Quahog is infested with loud, hairy
"
,,
3,7,"creatures, also known as New Yorkers.
"
,,
3,7,"They migrate north
"
,,
3,7,"every autumn to see the foliage.
"
,,
3,7,"I think I speak for all of us when I say
"
,,
3,7,"New Yorkers can fornicate
"
,,
3,7,"themselves with an iron stick.
"
,,
3,7," We're gonna be late for church.
"
,,
3,7," Move it! Damn leafers.
"
,,
3,7,"Christ, quit it! Mom,
"
,,
3,7,"Chris put his foot on my side again.
"
,,
3,7," I can't help it. I have long dancer's legs.
"
,,
3,7," Move it.
"
,,
3,7,"Stop whining. Stay on your side.
"
,,
3,7,"Lois, get off your ass and do some parenting.
"
,,
3,7,"If you don't stop, we won't
"
,,
3,7,"go to McDonald's after church.
"
,,
3,7," Mom!
"
,,
3,7," Don't worry. We're goin'.
"
,,
3,7," But you don't get the Super Size.
"
,,
3,7," Oh!
"
,,
3,7," OK, you can Super Size, but no apple pie.
"
,,
3,7," Come on.
"
,,
3,7,"OK, but you can't blow on it.
"
,,
3,7,"Peter, don't contradict me in front of the kids.
"
,,
3,7,"Brothers and sisters fightin' is as natural as
"
,,
3,7,"a white man's dialogue in a Spike Lee movie.
"
,,
3,7,"Wassup? Can I get two slices of pepperoni?
"
,,
3,7," Who are all these people?
"
,,
3,7," Damn New Yorkers.
"
,,
3,7,"They took all the good seats.
"
,,
3,7,"Aren't you precious!
"
,,
3,7,"Some of my novelty items
"
,,
3,7,"were provided by Jack's Joke Shop.
"
,,
3,7,"If it ain't funny, it ain't worth Jack.
"
,,
3,7,"I'd like to welcome
"
,,
3,7,"all our out-of-town parishioners.
"
,,
3,7,"My cousin, Father Sapienza,
"
,,
3,7,"is in from New York to see the leaves.
"
,,
3,7,"I'd like to invite him
"
,,
3,7,"to do the opening prayer.
"
,,
3,7,"Yo, God is good, huh?
"
,,
3,7,"And he expects us to be good.
"
,,
3,7,"And if you're not, he's gonna come down
"
,,
3,7,"and bust your freakin' skull. Amen.
"
,,
3,7,"Who do you think you're talking to?
"
,,
3,7,"God ain't tougher than me.
"
,,
3,7,"You can't talk to the father like that,
"
,,
3,7,"you stupid gavone.
"
,,
3,7,"I oughta come and break your freakin' arm!
"
,,
3,7,"Wanna go, tough guy?
"
,,
3,7,"I'll snap you in half like an almond biscotti
"
,,
3,7,"from Valero's on 51st Street, best in the city.
"
,,
3,7,"Fellas, this is God's house.
"
,,
3,7,"And the Patriots kick off in 45 minutes.
"
,,
3,7," Can we move this along?
"
,,
3,7," Patriots suck.
"
,,
3,7,"Blasphemy!
"
,,
3,7,"It burns!
"
,,
3,7,"Holy water? Where's that acid I ordered?
"
,,
3,7,"Hey, Guido, watch this.
"
,,
3,7,"Whoa! I've got to lay off the coffee.
"
,,
3,7,"Ha-cha-cha-cha-cha-cha!
"
,,
3,7,"That's Jack's. Exit 14 off 295.
"
,,
3,7,"Tae-jitsu is about power -
"
,,
3,7,"for your body and your mind.
"
,,
3,7,"Don't be afraid to free the beast inside you.
"
,,
3,7,"Left kick, right kick, punch combo, stomp.
"
,,
3,7,"Beautiful. Again. Left kick...
"
,,
3,7," You're doing great for your first lesson.
"
,,
3,7," I'm really cuttin' loose.
"
,,
3,7,"Like Julie Andrews in that movie
"
,,
3,7,"where she showed her breasts.
"
,,
3,7,"Mary, you'll never leave us, will you?
"
,,
3,7,"Lovely, but it doesn't quite
"
,,
3,7,"answer our question.
"
,,
3,7,"Jets rule!
"
,,
3,7,"Watch where you're going. Horace, put the
"
,,
3,7,"Pats game on the TV and get me a few beers.
"
,,
3,7,"Sorry, Peter. Someone stole the remotes.
"
,,
3,7,"And the kegs. And I'm not sure,
"
,,
3,7,"but I think I've been shot.
"
,,
3,7,"Yep.
"
,,
3,7,"Hey, pal, watch my seat.
"
,,
3,7,"I gotta bleed the lizard.
"
,,
3,7,"Public urination is just wrong.
"
,,
3,7,"Except during the Million Man March
"
,,
3,7,"when protesters burned our Porta-Pottis.
"
,,
3,7,"Then I used my stream of justice
"
,,
3,7,"to put out the hate.
"
,,
3,7,"I don't know, fellas. I think
"
,,
3,7,"there's potential in this crowd.
"
,,
3,7,"Honey, why don't you turn around
"
,,
3,7,"and show me the Lower East Side?
"
,,
3,7," Sure.
"
,,
3,7," Transvestite! Back off.
"
,,
3,7," Wait a sec. Pre-op or post-op?
"
,,
3,7," Pre-op.
"
,,
3,7,"Transvestite! Back off. This place blows.
"
,,
3,7,"We gotta send these strap-hangers back.
"
,,
3,7,"Don't worry. I got an idea.
"
,,
3,7,"An idea so smart, my head would explode if I
"
,,
3,7,"even began to know what I was talking about.
"
,,
3,7,"Aagh! I am a man-eating tree.
"
,,
3,7,"Go back to New York or I will eat you.
"
,,
3,7,"Just like I ate insane
"
,,
3,7,"New York anchorman Dan Rather. Pah!
"
,,
3,7,"And look who I had for dessert.
"
,,
3,7,"Asexual former mayor Ed Koch. Pah!
"
,,
3,7,"Leave my land or I will smite you
"
,,
3,7,"with my powerful limb.
"
,,
3,7,"What are you, nuts? Give me that branch.
"
,,
3,7,"Get off of me!
"
,,
3,7,"Oh, my God! Stop fighting!
"
,,
3,7," Holy crap!
"
,,
3,7," Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,7,"Mom, you could be a world champion,
"
,,
3,7,"and no one could hit you below the belt
"
,,
3,7,"cos girls don't have anything down there.
"
,,
3,7," Can you teach me to kick ass?
"
,,
3,7," No. I do not condone violence.
"
,,
3,7,"I won't be responsible for
"
,,
3,7,"bringing fistfighting into our schools.
"
,,
3,7,"Gee, can you hear me
"
,,
3,7,"all the way back there in the '50s?
"
,,
3,7," That was lame.
"
,,
3,7," Poor Peter.
"
,,
3,7,"I emasculated him in front of all those people.
"
,,
3,7,"I think he's really upset.
"
,,
3,7,"Gather round, everybody.
"
,,
3,7,"Step right up and fight my wife.
"
,,
3,7,"Come one, come all. She floats like a
"
,,
3,7,"butterfly and stings like when I pee.
"
,,
3,7,"Peter, I am not a sideshow attraction.
"
,,
3,7,"At least, not any more.
"
,,
3,7,"Me likey bouncy! Me likey bouncy!
"
,,
3,7,"I want you to get rid of all of this right now,
"
,,
3,7,"cos I am never fighting again, ever!
"
,,
3,7,"Come on, Chris. We'll have to go to plan B.
"
,,
3,7,"No! Oh, God! Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,7,"Help me! Help me!
"
,,
3,7,"For God's sake, he's gonna kill me!
"
,,
3,7,"Don't worry. It's a trained bear.
"
,,
3,7,"He's in no real danger.
"
,,
3,7,"He's teaching a class. I can't bother him now.
"
,,
3,7,"Sure you can. Hey, Ralph Macchio!
"
,,
3,7,"My wife here needs to talk to you.
"
,,
3,7,"There you go, honey.
"
,,
3,7," What is it, Lois?
"
,,
3,7," I don't think I should do tae-jitsu any more.
"
,,
3,7," I'm afraid I'm gonna hurt someone.
"
,,
3,7," But, Lois, you're my star pupil.
"
,,
3,7," I want you in my advanced class.
"
,,
3,7," Advanced class? No, no, no.
"
,,
3,7," I'm trying to quit.
"
,,
3,7," Well, fine. Quit.
"
,,
3,7," But get used to people walking all over you.
"
,,
3,7," Hold on, there.
"
,,
3,7,"Nobody walks all over my wife,
"
,,
3,7,"cos I won't let 'em.
"
,,
3,7," Peter...
"
,,
3,7," Quiet. Men are talking.
"
,,
3,7,"She learns things eventually.
"
,,
3,7,"It just takes her longer. Come on.
"
,,
3,7,"If you hurry, I'll let you try on hats.
"
,,
3,7,"I won't let you buy, but you can try 'em on.
"
,,
3,7,"I'll do it.
"
,,
3,7,"Ow!
"
,,
3,7," Stewie, you wanna swing?
"
,,
3,7," Yes, why not? I'll have a go at it.
"
,,
3,7,"Perhaps a quick stretch first.
"
,,
3,7,"Damn. Must have pulled something
"
,,
3,7,"playing hoops last week.
"
,,
3,7,"I know you're not puttin' that rock
"
,,
3,7,"up from here. You ain't got no J.
"
,,
3,7," Yo, man, that's trippin'!
"
,,
3,7," You're the one who's trippin'.
"
,,
3,7,"Cry home to your mama. She waitin' for ya.
"
,,
3,7,"Now don't make me put
"
,,
3,7,"my size 13s up your narrow ass!
"
,,
3,7,"I don't sweat you. Bring it on, bitch!
"
,,
3,7,"Now how you gonna act?
"
,,
3,7,"Sheesh! Bringin' that trash in here.
"
,,
3,7,"This is my house.
"
,,
3,7,"Excuse me. We were about to use that.
"
,,
3,7," You snooze, you lose, lady.
"
,,
3,7," You have two choices.
"
,,
3,7,"Either my baby swings from
"
,,
3,7,"this jungle gym, or you do.
"
,,
3,7,"Ooh, Lois! Someone's wearing
"
,,
3,7,"their ovaries on the outside.
"
,,
3,7," She saw me walking to the swing.
"
,,
3,7," She saw you. Easy, now.
"
,,
3,7,"Nobody walks all over me. Those days
"
,,
3,7,"are over. Lois Griffin demands respect.
"
,,
3,7,"I smell a messy diaper.
"
,,
3,7,"God, why does that turn me on?
"
,,
3,7," Hold it, Meg. Those two are mine.
"
,,
3,7," What?
"
,,
3,7,"That's Randy, and that's Fred.
"
,,
3,7,"Randy is the messy one. Fred's very neat.
"
,,
3,7,"When you get 'em together,
"
,,
3,7,"hold on to your sides!
"
,,
3,7,"Nice to meet you both.
"
,,
3,7,"Murderer!
"
,,
3,7,"Stop it, both of you. Starting now,
"
,,
3,7,"you two are gonna love each other.
"
,,
3,7,"Now stay that way.
"
,,
3,7,"It's gonna be weird to potty.
"
,,
3,7,"Sheesh, Lois, look at the garbage
"
,,
3,7,"those damn leafers dumped on our lawn.
"
,,
3,7,"New York Post, New York Magazine,
"
,,
3,7,"the New York Mets.
"
,,
3,7,"Peter, I'm sick and tired of hearing you whine
"
,,
3,7,"about the leafers. Take some action.
"
,,
3,7,"Free the beast!
"
,,
3,7,"That was strangely arousing. Aagh!
"
,,
3,7,"Hello? 911? It's Quagmire.
"
,,
3,7,"Yeah. It's in a window this time.
"
,,
3,7," Wow, look at them run.
"
,,
3,7," Wait a second, Brian. That gives me an idea.
"
,,
3,7,"The Drunken Clam? Why couldn't we go
"
,,
3,7,"someplace fancy, like The Olive Garden?
"
,,
3,7,"The breadsticks!
"
,,
3,7,"Me likey breadsticks! Me likey...
"
,,
3,7," You're a big girl now. Stop it.
"
,,
3,7," Hold on, Lois.
"
,,
3,7,"Excuse me, New Yorker. You're in my seat,
"
,,
3,7,"and I had sex with your mother last night.
"
,,
3,7," Are you crazy?
"
,,
3,7," What did you say?
"
,,
3,7,"About the seat, or about
"
,,
3,7,"my ploughing your father's wife?
"
,,
3,7," What the hell are you doing?
"
,,
3,7," Excuse me. Is your refrigerator running?
"
,,
3,7,"If it is, it probably runs like you -
"
,,
3,7,"very homosexually.
"
,,
3,7," What?!
"
,,
3,7," Oh, you wanna dance?
"
,,
3,7,"Jets suck, Yankees suck, Knicks suck.
"
,,
3,7,"Krypton sucks.
"
,,
3,7,"That's right. Go back where
"
,,
3,7,"you came from, you bastards!
"
,,
3,7,"We'll conclude the graduation ceremony
"
,,
3,7,"with a demonstration by the black belts.
"
,,
3,7,"Let's show 'em what we've learnt.
"
,,
3,7," Kathy, get in there with Lois.
"
,,
3,7," I can't. I have cramps.
"
,,
3,7,"Why are you putting me up
"
,,
3,7,"against the scrubs?
"
,,
3,7," Be a man and fight me yourself.
"
,,
3,7," Lois, the sensei is a sacred position.
"
,,
3,7,"I could never violate the spiritual bond
"
,,
3,7,"of the student-master relationship.
"
,,
3,7," Then allow me.
"
,,
3,7," Ooh!
"
,,
3,7," The bond is broken.
"
,,
3,7," Then spin the wheel, raggedy man!

"

3,7,"Yah!

3,7,"Get out of the way!
"
,,
3,7,"Lois, I was watching that.
"
,,
3,7," What you looking at?
"
,,
3,7," The underpants. Lose 'em.
"
,,
3,7,"Actually, I kinda...
"
,,
3,7,"I sorta have a headache, kinda.
"
,,
3,7," Maybe tomorrow or...
"
,,
3,7," Take 'em off.
"
,,
3,7,"Yeah, OK, honey.
"
,,
3,7,"Whoa! What the hell are you doing?
"
,,
3,7,"Those are my graham crackers.
"
,,
3,7,"Run along, Stewie. Daddy had a rough night.
"
,,
3,7,"Why, you tottering, fem-sucked dewberry!
"
,,
3,7,"I'm going to go find something
"
,,
3,7,"to strike you with. Excuse me.
"
,,
3,7,"Good morning.
"
,,
3,7,"Peter, you look terrible. What happened?
"
,,
3,7,"Last night Lois was... the man!
"
,,
3,7," Good Lord.
"
,,
3,7," I just want you to know, Brian, I didn't cry.
"
,,
3,7,"It's OK. Shh.
"
,,
3,7,"Oh, no! Peter! Stewie, what did you do?
"
,,
3,7,"He freed the beast
"
,,
3,7,"all over the back of Peter's head.
"
,,
3,7,"Oh, my God. This is my fault.
"
,,
3,7,"This is my fault!
"
,,
3,7,"I brought violence into this house!
"
,,
3,7," I'm the worst mother in the world!
"
,,
3,7," Ah-ha! I got it all on tape.
"
,,
3,7,"OK, this is me
"
,,
3,7,"interviewing Ed Sullivan.
"
,,
3,7,"What's new, Ed?
"
,,
3,7,"Well, Stewie,
"
,,
3,7,"tonight we have a really big show.
"
,,
3,7,"OK, and now a word
"
,,
3,7,"from our sponsors.
"
,,
3,7,"It takes a very steady hand.
"
,,
3,7,"Don't touch the sides!
"
,,
3,7,"Butterfingers!
"
,,
3,7,"I was making radio shows for fun.
"
,,
3,7,"Everybody does it.
"
,,
3,7,"At least, everybody I know. Shut up!
"
,,
3,7,"Stewart, take this mommy doll and daddy
"
,,

"
,,
3,7,"Oh. Yes, very well. All right.

"

3,7,"have a history of aggression?
"
,,
3,7,"No. Hitting Peter is the first
"
,,
3,7,"violent thing he's ever done.
"
,,
3,7,"Technically, the first was that time bomb
"
,,
3,7,"I left ticking in your uterus before I came out.
"
,,
3,7,"Happy 50th birthday, Lois.
"
,,
3,7,"Your son is learning

"
,,
3,7,"I... I know who's responsible
"
,,
3,7,"for Stewie's behaviour,
"
,,
3,7,"but if I told you,
"
,,
3,7,"Lois'd beat the crap out of me.
"
,,
3,7,"Now, just a minute! The whole reason
"
,,
3,7,"I started fighting is because of you.
"
,,
3,7,"I felt weak. You never listen to me.
"
,,
3,7,"You undermine me in front of the kids.
"
,,
3,7,"And besides, you're not exactly
"
,,
3,7,"Father of the Year yourself.
"
,,
3,7,"Well, there seems to be a lot
"
,,
3,7,"of anger in your household.
"
,,
3,7,"You owe it to your son to learn
"
,,
3,7,"how to manage these feelings.
"
,,
3,7,"Manage what?
"
,,
3,7,"I know I went a little overboard
"
,,
3,7,"with my tae-jitsu,
"
,,
3,7,"but from now on we're not gonna have
"
,,
3,7,"any more anger in this house, OK?
"
,,
3,7,"Tell Chris to quit drawing
"

3,7,"pictures of me with a pig's body.
"
,,
3,7," Don't censure me!
"
,,
3,7," No more anger!
"
,,
3,7,"OK. The psychologist wants us
"
,,
3,7,"to try an exercise called role reversal,
"
,,
3,7,"where we pretend to be

"

3,7,"What about writing angry letters
"
,,
3,7,"and not sending them?
"
,,
3,7," I wasn't supposed to send those?
"
,,
3,7," I got a letter from Dad.

3,7,"Hold on a sec.
"
,,
3,7,"Hold on. Relax. Everybody, relax.
"
,,
3,7,"I was hoping it wouldn't come to this,

3,7,"but we need to get our anger under control
"
,,
3,7,"before we kill each other.
"
,,
3,7,"My psychiatrist gave me
"
,,
3,7,"these mood elevators.
"
,,
3,7,"I think they could help even us out.
"

"
,,
3,7,"creatures, also known as New Yorkers.
"
,,
3,7,"They migrate north
"
,,

"
,,
3,7,"I think I speak for all of us when I say

3,7,"New Yorkers can fornicate

3,7,"And he expects us to be good.
"

3,7," Pre-op.

,,
3,7,"Transvestite! Back off. This place blows.

,,
3,7,"We gotta send these strap-hangers back.

3,7,"Don't worry. I got an idea.
"
,,
3,7,"An idea so smart, my head would explode if I
"
,,
3,7,"even began to know what I was talking about.
"
,,
3,7,"Aagh! I am a man-eating tree.
"
,,
3,7,"Go back to New York or I will eat you.

,,
3,7,"And look who I had for dessert.

3,7,"Get off of me!

,,
3,7,"and no one could hit you below the belt
"
,,
3,7,"cos girls don't have anything down there.
"
,,
3,7," Can you teach me to kick ass?
"
,,
3,7," No. I do not condone violence.
"
,,
3,7,"I won't be responsible for

,,
3,7,"bringing fistfighting into our schools.
"
,,
3,7,"Gee, can you hear me
"
,,
3,7,"all the way back there in the '50s?
"
,,
3,7," That was lame.
"
,,
3,7," Poor Peter.
"
,,
3,7,"I emasculated him in front of all those people.

"
,,
3,7,"Gather round, everybody.
"
,,
3,7,"Step right up and fight my wife.

3,7,"Don't worry. It's a trained bear.
"
,,
3,7,"He's in no real danger.
"
,,
3,7,"He's teaching a class. I can't bother him now.
"
,,
3,7,"Sure you can. Hey, Ralph Macchio!
"
,,
3,7,"My wife here needs to talk to you.
"
,,
3,7,"There you go, honey.
"
,,
3,7," What is it, Lois?
"
,,
3,7," I don't think I should do tae-jitsu any more.
"
,,
3,7," I'm afraid I'm gonna hurt someone.
"
,,
3,7," But, Lois, you're my star pupil.
"
,,
3,7," I want you in my advanced class.
"
,,
3,7," Advanced class? No, no, no.
"
,,
3,7," I'm trying to quit.
"
,,
3,7," Well, fine. Quit.
"
,,
3,7," But get used to people walking all over you.
"
,,
3,7," Hold on, there.
"
,,
3,7,"Nobody walks all over my wife,
"
,,
3,7,"cos I won't let 'em.
"
,,
3,7," Peter...
"
,,
3,7," Quiet. Men are talking.
"
,,
3,7,"She learns things eventually.
"
,,
3,7,"It just takes her longer. Come on.
"
,,
3,7,"If you hurry, I'll let you try on hats.
"
,,
3,7,"I won't let you buy, but you can try 'em on.
"
,,
3,7,"I'll do it.
"
,,
3,7,"Ow!
"
,,
3,7," Stewie, you wanna swing?
"
,,
3,7," Yes, why not? I'll have a go at it.
"
,,
3,7,"Perhaps a quick stretch first.
"
,,
3,7,"Damn. Must have pulled something
"
,,
3,7,"playing hoops last week.
"
,,
3,7,"I know you're not puttin' that rock
"
,,
3,7,"up from here. You ain't got no J.
"
,,
3,7," Yo, man, that's trippin'!
"
,,
3,7," You're the one who's trippin'.
"
,,
3,7,"Cry home to your mama. She waitin' for ya.
"
,,
3,7,"Now don't make me put
"
,,
3,7,"my size 13s up your narrow ass!
"
,,
3,7,"I don't sweat you. Bring it on, bitch!
"
,,
3,7,"Now how you gonna act?
"
,,
3,7,"Sheesh! Bringin' that trash in here.
"
,,
3,7,"This is my house.
"
,,
3,7,"Excuse me. We were about to use that.
"
,,
3,7," You snooze, you lose, lady.
"
,,
3,7," You have two choices.
"
,,
3,7,"Either my baby swings from
"
,,
3,7,"this jungle gym, or you do.
"
,,
3,7,"Ooh, Lois! Someone's wearing
"
,,
3,7,"their ovaries on the outside.
"
,,
3,7," She saw me walking to the swing.
"
,,
3,7," She saw you. Easy, now.
"
,,
3,7,"Nobody walks all over me. Those days
"
,,
3,7,"are over. Lois Griffin demands respect.
"
,,
3,7,"I smell a messy diaper.
"
,,
3,7,"God, why does that turn me on?
"
,,
3,7," Hold it, Meg. Those two are mine.
"
,,
3,7," What?
"
,,
3,7,"That's Randy, and that's Fred.
"
,,
3,7,"Randy is the messy one. Fred's very neat.
"
,,
3,7,"When you get 'em together,
"
,,
3,7,"hold on to your sides!
"
,,
3,7,"Nice to meet you both.
"
,,
3,7,"Murderer!
"
,,
3,7,"Stop it, both of you. Starting now,
"
,,
3,7,"you two are gonna love each other.
"
,,
3,7,"Now stay that way.
"
,,
3,7,"It's gonna be weird to potty.
"
,,
3,7,"Sheesh, Lois, look at the garbage
"
,,
3,7,"those damn leafers dumped on our lawn.
"
,,
3,7,"New York Post, New York Magazine,
"
,,
3,7,"the New York Mets.
"
,,
3,7,"Peter, I'm sick and tired of hearing you whine
"
,,
3,7,"about the leafers. Take some action.
"
,,
3,7,"Free the beast!
"
,,
3,7,"That was strangely arousing. Aagh!
"
,,
3,7,"Hello? 911? It's Quagmire.
"
,,
3,7,"Yeah. It's in a window this time.
"
,,
3,7," Wow, look at them run.
"
,,
3,7," Wait a second, Brian. That gives me an idea.
"
,,
3,7,"The Drunken Clam? Why couldn't we go
"
,,
3,7,"someplace fancy, like The Olive Garden?
"
,,
3,7,"The breadsticks!
"
,,
3,7,"Me likey breadsticks! Me likey...
"
,,
3,7," You're a big girl now. Stop it.
"
,,
3,7," Hold on, Lois.
"
,,
3,7,"Excuse me, New Yorker. You're in my seat,
"
,,
3,7,"and I had sex with your mother last night.
"
,,
3,7," Are you crazy?
"
,,
3,7," What did you say?
"
,,
3,7,"About the seat, or about
"
,,
3,7,"my ploughing your father's wife?
"
,,
3,7," What the hell are you doing?
"
,,
3,7," Excuse me. Is your refrigerator running?
"
,,
3,7,"If it is, it probably runs like you -
"
,,
3,7,"very homosexually.
"
,,
3,7," What?!
"
,,
3,7," Oh, you wanna dance?
"
,,
3,7,"Jets suck, Yankees suck, Knicks suck.
"
,,
3,7,"Krypton sucks.
"
,,
3,7,"That's right. Go back where
"
,,
3,7,"you came from, you bastards!
"
,,
3,7,"We'll conclude the graduation ceremony
"
,,
3,7,"with a demonstration by the black belts.
"
,,
3,7,"Let's show 'em what we've learnt.
"
,,
3,7," Kathy, get in there with Lois.
"
,,
3,7," I can't. I have cramps.
"
,,
3,7,"Why are you putting me up
"
,,
3,7,"against the scrubs?
"
,,
3,7," Be a man and fight me yourself.
"
,,
3,7," Lois, the sensei is a sacred position.
"
,,
3,7,"I could never violate the spiritual bond
"
,,
3,7,"of the student-master relationship.
"
,,
3,7," Then allow me.
"
,,
3,7," Ooh!
"
,,
3,7," The bond is broken.
"
,,
3,7," Then spin the wheel, raggedy man!
"
,,
3,7,"Go, Lois! Pummel him
"
,,
3,7,"with your powerful fists of female fury.
"
,,
3,7,"And then when he's weary,
"
,,
3,7,"emasculate him with your incessant nagging.
"
,,
3,7,"Women! Yakety-yak, yakety-yak, yak, yak.
"
,,
3,7,"You know, huh? Enjoy the fight.
"
,,
3,7,"Yah!
"
,,
3,7,"Lois, that was amazing. Congratu...
"
,,
3,7,"This is mine.
"
,,
3,7,"This is where my babies come from.
"
,,
3,7,"And now back to the movie of the week.

3,7,"Get out of the way!

,,
3,7,"Lois, I was watching that.
"
,,
3,7," What you looking at?
"
,,
3,7," The underpants. Lose 'em.
"
,,
3,7,"Actually, I kinda...
"
,,
3,7,"I sorta have a headache, kinda.
"
,,
3,7," Maybe tomorrow or...
"
,,
3,7," Take 'em off.
"

3,7,"Yeah, OK, honey.
"

3,7,"Whoa! What the hell are you doing?
"

3,7,"Those are my graham crackers.

"

3,7,"Why, you tottering, fem-sucked dewberry!

3,7,"Peter, you look terrible. What happened?
"
,,
3,7,"Last night Lois was... the man!
"
,,
3,7," Good Lord.
"
,,
3,7," I just want you to know, Brian, I didn't cry.
"
,,
3,7,"It's OK. Shh.
"
,,
3,7,"Oh, no! Peter! Stewie, what did you do?
"
,,
3,7,"He freed the beast
"

3,7,"all over the back of Peter's head.
"
,,
3,7,"Oh, my God. This is my fault.
"

3,7,"This is my fault!
"

3,7,"I brought violence into this house!
"

3,7," I'm the worst mother in the world!

3,8,"And so, because of his
"
,,
3,8,"rough-and-tumble style of command,
"
,,
3,8,"Captain Kirk is clearly superior
"
,,
3,8,"to Jean-Luc Picard.
"
,,
3,8," Any questions? Meg?
"
,,
3,8," No. Leave me alone.
"
,,
3,8,"Thank you, Neil,
"
,,
3,8,"for that irrelevant presentation.
"
,,
3,8,"We all know Captain Picard
"
,,
3,8,"is the superior officer.
"
,,
3,8," Ugh!
"
,,
3,8," Mr Lassenbee's getting arrested.
"
,,
3,8,"What in God's name...? Mr Lassenbee,
"
,,
3,8,"what the hell's going on here?
"
,,
3,8,"There's a law against teaching
"
,,
3,8,"the evolutionary theory
"
,,
3,8,"that Gil Gerard used a time machine
"
,,
3,8,"and ejaculated into the primordial ooze.
"
,,
3,8,"This stupid country.
"
,,
3,8,"Tom Tucker, live at James Woods High
"
,,
3,8,"School with this sensational breaking story.
"
,,
3,8,"A teacher caught molesting children...
"
,,
3,8,"with crackpot theories. Full story at 11.
"
,,
3,8,"And out.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,8,"That's Tom Tucker from the news.
"
,,
3,8,"Hey, kids. Remember, Mr T says
"
,,
3,8,"""I pity the fool who does drugs. ""
"
,,
3,8," Better hurry up, Mr Tucker.
"
,,
3,8," I'm coming.
"
,,
3,8,"Reports indicate she has consumed
"
,,
3,8,"a record amount of seamen.
"
,,
3,8,"Sounds like one powerful hurricane.
"
,,
3,8,"In other news, school board elections
"
,,
3,8,"took place last evening.
"
,,
3,8,"Fred Johnson leads candidate Betsy LaFoe
"
,,
3,8,"by a substantial...
"
,,
3,8,"Hi, Meg. You know how cute I think you are.
"
,,
3,8,"...turmoil when President Bush
"
,,
3,8,"stuck his finger in a socket.
"
,,
3,8,"Whoa!
"
,,
3,8,"Yikes. Awkward.
"
,,
3,8,"...that's where leprechauns
"
,,
3,8,"hide their gold. More at 11.
"
,,
3,8,"Hey, you know who lives in this house?
"
,,
3,8,"A great big phony! That's right.
"
,,
3,8,"A phony lives here. A big fat phony!
"
,,
3,8,"I say, look at me.
"
,,
3,8,"I feel like a regular grease monkey.
"
,,
3,8," Remember that time I had that Mustang?
"
,,
3,8," Oh, yeah, you took her for a spin that time.
"
,,
3,8,"That was awesome.
"
,,
3,8,"Those chowderheads on the corner
"
,,
3,8,"busted your stones.
"
,,
3,8,"Hey, your sister say anything about me?
"
,,
3,8," Oh, my God. I'm missing the news!
"
,,
3,8," We all miss The News, Meg.
"
,,
3,8,"But Huey Lewis needs time to create.
"
,,
3,8,"We have to be patient.
"
,,
3,8,"And in entertainment,
"
,,
3,8,"Mary Tyler Moore is 64 years old today.
"
,,
3,8," Really? 64?
"
,,
3,8," Yes.
"
,,
3,8," I thought she was dead.
"
,,
3,8," She's alive.
"
,,
3,8,"Fantastic. And now this.
"
,,
3,8,"Are you a student interested in
"
,,
3,8,"the glamorous world of unpaid internships?
"
,,
3,8,"If so, you can try out for
"
,,
3,8,"Channel Five's young anchor programme.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, wow!
"
,,
3,8,"You'll gain valuable experience,
"
,,
3,8,"work closely with Tom and me,
"
,,
3,8,"and produce your own on-air report.
"
,,
3,8,"So call us now.
"
,,
3,8,"Yeah!
"
,,
3,8,"Question number one:
"
,,
3,8,"Would you consider growing a moustache?
"
,,
3,8,"I guess so.
"
,,
3,8,"Question two: Look at my moustache.
"
,,
3,8,"Do you think it tickles women
"
,,
3,8,"when I kiss them?
"
,,
3,8,"I don't know.
"
,,
3,8,"Wrong. The answer is: Only slightly,
"
,,
3,8,"only slightly. Next.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, God, I can't hire any of these girls.
"
,,
3,8,"They're all too pretty.
"
,,
3,8,"Their breasts are too perky.
"
,,
3,8,"Perfect.
"
,,
3,8,"Congratulations. You got the job.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, my God! Oh, thank you, thank you!
"
,,
3,8,"This is beyond anything I've ever dreamed of!
"
,,
3,8,"You and your partner
"
,,
3,8,"will start tomorrow after school.
"
,,
3,8," Great! Who's my partner?
"
,,
3,8," Hey, there, hot stuff!
"
,,
3,8,"Well, well. It appears the Fates
"
,,
3,8,"have conspired in our favour. Eh, Meg?
"
,,
3,8,"Stay away from me, Neil.
"
,,
3,8,"Just because we're working together
"
,,
3,8,"does not mean I like you. Give it to me!
"
,,
3,8," What's that?
"
,,
3,8," Give it to me, Neil.
"
,,
3,8," Give it to me! Give it to me, Neil.
"
,,
3,8," Yeah. That'll work just fine.
"
,,
3,8,"Ugh!
"
,,
3,8,"Look who's here.
"
,,
3,8,"It's our bright-eyed young interns.
"
,,
3,8," Did you two wear your eager caps?
"
,,
3,8," I sure did, Mr Tucker.
"
,,
3,8,"Great. Cos you two
"
,,
3,8,"are gonna have so much fun!
"
,,
3,8,"Don't act any cheerier.
"
,,
3,8,"You'll give us all diabetes.
"
,,
3,8," Bite me, Tom.
"
,,
3,8," Come on, kids.
"
,,
3,8,"Here's where we produce
"
,,
3,8,"our celebrity interviews.
"
,,
3,8,"I did one with Dustin Hoffman.
"
,,
3,8,"He's almost impossible to book.
"
,,
3,8,"Dustin, it's been a while.
"
,,
3,8,"I gotta say, you look great.
"
,,
3,8,"Are you trying to seduce me?
"
,,
3,8,"I am not trying to seduce you,
"
,,
3,8,"Dustin Hoffman. You really look great.
"
,,
3,8," Uh-oh. Twelve minutes to Wapner.
"
,,
3,8," I understand your hectic schedule.
"
,,
3,8,"We appreciate you taking the time
"
,,
3,8,"to be with us here in the studio.
"
,,
3,8," If there's anything I can ever do for you...
"
,,
3,8," Bring me Peter Pan!
"
,,
3,8,"I'll keep my eye out for him.
"
,,
3,8,"Thanks, Dustin.
"
,,
3,8,"He's this tall.
"
,,
3,8,"Can you believe it? Our little Stewie
"
,,
3,8,"learning to ride his first tricycle.
"
,,
3,8,"This'll be more exciting than when Brian
"
,,
3,8,"taught me about Columbus.
"
,,
3,8," Where are we going?
"
,,
3,8," We're going to visit the year 1492.
"
,,
3,8,"That's when Columbus set sail
"
,,
3,8,"for the New World.
"
,,
3,8," We're on a ship.
"
,,
3,8," This is the Santa Maria.
"
,,
3,8,"Columbus took it to find a route to India.
"
,,
3,8," Any sign of India yet?
"
,,
3,8," Nothing yet.
"
,,
3,8,"Columbus was going to America.
"
,,
3,8,"Columbus discovered America
"
,,
3,8,"entirely by mistake.
"
,,
3,8,"Wow!
"
,,
3,8," What are you doing? Back off, fat man.
"
,,
3,8," Hang on, Stewie.
"
,,
3,8,"What the...? Hey, hey, let go.
"
,,
3,8,"Get your filthy paws off.
"
,,
3,8,"Let go. Let go, I say. Let go. Don't let go!
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, this is exhilarating.
"
,,
3,8," Go, Stewie!
"
,,
3,8," Yay, Stewie!
"
,,
3,8,"I gotta go check on dinner. You keep
"
,,
3,8,"taping Stewie. Don't miss a moment.
"
,,
3,8,"I got it.
"
,,
3,8,"Look, it's dancing with me.
"
,,
3,8,"It's this incredibly benevolent force
"
,,
3,8,"that wants me to know
"
,,
3,8,"there's no reason to be afraid.
"
,,
3,8,"Sometimes there's so much beauty
"
,,
3,8,"in the world, it makes my heart burst.
"
,,
3,8,"It's just some trash blowing in the wind!
"
,,
3,8,"Do you have any idea how complicated
"
,,
3,8,"your circulatory system is?
"
,,
3,8,"Hi, Mr Tucker. I brought you Rice Crispy
"
,,
3,8,"Treats. I remember you said you liked them.
"
,,
3,8,"Look. This one is in the shape of a heart.
"
,,
3,8,"I'm sorry, but there's a handsome man
"
,,
3,8,"in my spoon. Come back later.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, my God.
"
,,
3,8,"Meg's in love with Tom Tucker!
"
,,
3,8,"Try to move in on my woman,
"
,,
3,8,"will you, Tom Tucker?
"
,,
3,8,"No one crosses Neil Goldman
"
,,
3,8,"and gets away with it.
"
,,
3,8,"I added something to your coffee
"
,,
3,8,"I don't think you're gonna like.
"
,,
3,8," Here's your coffee, Mr Tucker.
"
,,
3,8," What the hell is in this?
"
,,
3,8,"Sweet'N Low.
"
,,
3,8,"That's for trying to steal my woman!
"
,,
3,8," Bring it to me with urine in it like I asked.
"
,,
3,8," Yes, sir.
"
,,
3,8," Nice bike.
"
,,
3,8," That's the understatement of the century.
"
,,
3,8," It's cool. Too cool for you.
"
,,
3,8," No, no. I think it's right where I'm at.
"
,,
3,8,"Out of my way!
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, I see. Oh, yes, I suppose you do have
"
,,
3,8,"to ride it to truly appreciate its virtues.
"
,,
3,8,"Well, then, I'll just wait
"
,,
3,8,"right here till you get back.
"
,,
3,8," Where the devil is he?
"
,,
3,8," You've obviously never met a bully.
"
,,
3,8,"What do you mean?
"
,,
3,8,"He wasn't taking it for a test ride,
"
,,
3,8,"he was just taking it.
"
,,
3,8," You... you mean...?
"
,,
3,8," Mm-hm.
"
,,
3,8,"He... stole... my trikey?
"
,,
3,8,"Mr Tucker, has anyone
"
,,
3,8,"ever told you your eyes are...
"
,,
3,8,"Hang on, sweetie. I've gotta call Peter
"
,,
3,8,"Jennings and reschedule our golf game.
"
,,
3,8,"This is Peter. You know what to do.
"
,,
3,8,"Mr Tucker, Miss Simmons, there's a nut on
"
,,
3,8,"top of Town Hall with a high-powered rifle.
"
,,
3,8,"The gunman's been identified as the
"
,,
3,8,"Mass Media Murderer who targets the press.
"
,,
3,8,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Mass Media Murderer?
"
,,
3,8,"I think this would be a fine opportunity
"
,,
3,8,"to give our interns real-world experience.
"
,,
3,8,"That means you'll get to ride
"
,,
3,8,"in the news chopper. I'm so jealous.
"
,,
3,8,"Better put in for some new interns.
"
,,
3,8,"Good luck!
"
,,
3,8,"I've got Hugh Downs up here.
"
,,
3,8,"I'm gonna splatter his distinguished career
"
,,
3,8,"all over the pavement.
"
,,
3,8," Hey, why me? Why the media?
"
,,
3,8," I've got my reasons.
"
,,
3,8,"Dan Rather thinks he can condense
"
,,
3,8,"a whole day's events into a half-hour.
"
,,
3,8,"Don't get me started on that arrogant jerk.
"
,,
3,8," Really? You know him?
"
,,
3,8," I'm Hugh Downs. I know everybody.
"
,,
3,8," In fact, he's down there.
"
,,
3,8," Where?
"
,,
3,8,"Ha-ha! See ya later, sucker! And by the way,
"
,,
3,8,"Rather is an OK guy in small doses.
"
,,
3,8,"Look how close we're getting, Meg.
"
,,
3,8,"Hey! That was my lucky assassin hat!
"
,,
3,8,"Mayday! Mayday! I'm going down!
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, my God, we're gonna die! There's
"
,,
3,8,"so much of life I haven't experienced!
"
,,
3,8,"I never got the chance to be some
"
,,
3,8,"drunk college guy's last resort!
"
,,
3,8,"My years of expensive orthodontic work
"
,,
3,8,"will be a total waste!
"
,,
3,8," I never even had my first kiss!
"
,,
3,8," It's not too late, Meg.
"
,,
3,8,"I'm here for you.
"
,,
3,8,"Time to sign off.
"
,,
3,8,"Remember me, dirt bag?
"
,,
3,8,"Wow! You saved
"
,,
3,8,"those kids' lives, Mr Downs.
"
,,
3,8,"All in a day's work. If you ever need me,
"
,,
3,8,"just blow this whistle,
"
,,
3,8,"or call John Stossel's cellphone.
"
,,
3,8,"Hugh Downs away!
"
,,
3,8,"Honey, thank God you're safe.
"
,,
3,8,"We were so worried.
"
,,
3,8,"We now go to junior anchor Neil Goldman
"
,,
3,8,"with exclusive footage
"
,,
3,8,"from today's exciting scene.
"
,,
3,8,"Thank you, Diane. There may have been
"
,,
3,8,"some commotion on the rooftop,
"
,,
3,8,"but the real story was inside the mouths
"
,,
3,8,"of Meg Griffin and Neil Goldman,
"
,,
3,8,"where a meeting of the tongues,
"
,,
3,8,"a summit of saliva,
"
,,
3,8,"established a new world order of love.
"
,,
3,8,"Agh!
"
,,
3,8,"Let's watch it one more time
"
,,
3,8,"in super slow-mo.
"
,,
3,8,"This is where we cease to be Meg and Neil
"
,,
3,8,"and begin life anew as Meil.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, my God. He put it on TV?
"
,,
3,8,"Isn't that cute, Peter?
"
,,
3,8,"Our daughter's first love.
"
,,
3,8,"I just want to kill myself! I'm going upstairs
"
,,
3,8,"right now and eat a whole bowl of peanuts.
"
,,
3,8,"I'm allergic to peanuts!
"
,,
3,8,"You don't know anything about me!
"
,,
3,8,"Who was that guy?
"
,,
3,8,"Constable, I'd like to report
"
,,
3,8,"the theft of my tricycle.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, look at the little baby.
"
,,
3,8,"Aren't you cute! Where's your mommy?
"
,,
3,8,"How dare you condescend to me?
"
,,
3,8,"I demand justice!
"
,,
3,8,"I'm here to turn myself in. I have
"
,,
3,8,"a dismembered hooker bleeding in my trunk.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, look at the little baby.
"
,,
3,8,"Aren't you cute! Where's your mommy?
"
,,
3,8," Where did you get that shirt?
"
,,
3,8," From Neil.
"
,,
3,8,"Hello, lover.
"
,,
3,8,"Neil, what are you doing?
"
,,
3,8,"I'm not your lover. I don't even like you.
"
,,
3,8,"Meg, I strongly suggest you hold
"
,,
3,8,"my hand, lest you look like a slut.
"
,,
3,8,"Tell these people that there's
"
,,
3,8,"nothing going on between us.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, don't be afraid of the fire, Meg.
"
,,
3,8,"I won't let you burn.
"
,,
3,8,"Al, why haven't I leaped?
"
,,
3,8,"Ziggy says you can't leap
"
,,
3,8,"until she loves you back.
"
,,
3,8,"Don't worry, I'll get her.
"
,,
3,8,"What do you want to work on?
"
,,
3,8,"Cardio? Upper body?
"
,,
3,8,"Upper body. I need to get buff,
"
,,
3,8,"so I can get my tricycle back.
"
,,
3,8,"Luckily, we're running a special
"
,,
3,8,"for the next 17 minutes.
"
,,
3,8,"OK. That's a little unusual but... OK, tell me.
"
,,
3,8,"The normal plan is 78 months
"
,,
3,8,"at 40 a month and 200 down. Watch this.
"
,,
3,8," Forget the down.
"
,,
3,8," Yeah.
"
,,
3,8,"Goodbye 40 a month, let's do 35.
"
,,
3,8," 35. That's the cheapest?
"
,,
3,8," Yeah, hang on, hang on.
"
,,
3,8,"Trace, can you bring me
"
,,
3,8,"some free gym bags?
"
,,
3,8,"I could probably just do
"
,,
3,8,"some push-ups at home.
"
,,
3,8,"Let's start you off with a body-fat test,
"
,,
3,8,"maybe a heart rate.
"
,,
3,8,"You're not hearing me. I don't think
"
,,
3,8,"this is for me. Thanks, anyway.
"
,,
3,8,"And for the future,
"
,,
3,8,"you came on a little strong.
"
,,
3,8," What's going on here?
"
,,
3,8," We invited Neil's family over for dinner.
"
,,
3,8," Hi.
"
,,
3,8," Hello.
"
,,
3,8," You what?!
"
,,
3,8," To get to know 'em better.
"
,,
3,8,"Seeing as you two
"
,,
3,8,"will one day bless our home
"
,,
3,8,"with the pitter-patter
"
,,
3,8,"of grandchildren as ugly as sin.
"
,,
3,8,"Meg, you never told me your mother
"
,,
3,8,"was such a stone-cold fox.
"
,,
3,8," Now I see where you get it.
"
,,
3,8," Meg, he's so charming.
"
,,
3,8,"My name is Chris.
"
,,
3,8,"I'm supposed to be on my best behaviour
"
,,
3,8,"tonight and not mention poo.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, God, what have I done?!
"
,,
3,8,"Well, let's eat.
"
,,
3,8,"I think it's very, very nice that our children
"
,,
3,8,"had this wonderful kiss.
"
,,
3,8,"I remember when Muriel and I had
"
,,
3,8,"our first kiss, and it was just awful.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, just awful. We were both very sick.
"
,,
3,8,"Weren't we, dear?
"
,,
3,8,"Ugh, we were terribly sick.
"
,,
3,8,"We were both 14 and it was winter
"
,,
3,8,"and we had terrible head colds.
"
,,
3,8,"Mine especially was very bad. I had terrible
"
,,
3,8,"mucus coming out from inside my nose.
"
,,
3,8,"And the other children,
"
,,
3,8,"they were very nasty to me.
"
,,
3,8,"They said bad, hurtful things to me.
"
,,
3,8,"They called me Tasty Cakes,
"
,,
3,8,"and they would beat me
"
,,
3,8,"and stick pine cones in my ass.
"
,,
3,8," Those were very bad times.
"
,,
3,8," I'm sorry to hear that.
"
,,
3,8,"Thank you very much.
"
,,
3,8,"Excuse me. I'm gonna go throw up.
"
,,
3,8,"Please flush the toilet twice.
"
,,
3,8,"Once for the bulk, and again for the
"
,,
3,8,"remainder. Thank you. Oh, she's a dear.
"
,,
3,8,"You're blocking my light, you stupid baby!
"
,,
3,8,"My hooligan friend,
"
,,
3,8,"I've been racking my brain
"
,,
3,8,"in a fruitless attempt
"
,,
3,8,"to resolve our unpleasantness.
"
,,
3,8,"But then it dawned on me. Your cruelty
"
,,
3,8,"merely stems from a deep-seated inner pain.
"
,,
3,8,"The obvious remedy
"
,,
3,8,"is a healthy dose of outer pain!
"
,,
3,8,"Children washing cars to raise money
"
,,
3,8,"for charity. Is anything more arousing?
"
,,
3,8,"We go to Meg Griffin for a special Channel
"
,,
3,8,"Five junior anchor segment on the moon.
"
,,
3,8,"The moon. There's a reason
"
,,
3,8,"no one goes there. It's cold, and it's ugly.
"
,,
3,8,"Its surface is plagued
"
,,
3,8,"with craters and jagged peaks.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, wait! That's not the moon.
"
,,
3,8,"It's Neil Goldman's face.
"
,,
3,8,"Recently, many of you saw me
"
,,
3,8,"kissing this freak of nature.
"
,,
3,8,"If I wasn't seconds away from death,
"
,,
3,8,"I wouldn't have done it.

,,
3,8,"I mean, who in their right mind would?
"
,,
3,8,"I went to the streets to find out.
"
,,
3,8,"Would you kiss this guy?
"
,,
3,8," Ugh! No!
"
,,
3,8," No way!
"
,,
3,8," No!
"
,,
3,8," No!
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, God, no!
"
,,
3,8,"What's the matter with you? Oh!
"
,,
3,8,"It's official. Neil Goldman isn't kissable.
"
,,
3,8,"Hear that, Neil? I don't like you.
"
,,
3,8,"I never will! Back to you, Tom.
"
,,
3,8,"Thank you, Meg. I guess beggars
"
,,
3,8,"can be choosers. And now this.
"
,,
3,8," Well, well. Isn't this a darling picture!
"
,,
3,8," Let me go, man!
"
,,
3,8," How old are you, Charlie?
"
,,
3,8," Seven.
"
,,
3,8,"Seven? Well, my, my.
"
,,
3,8,"You're practically a lady.
"
,,
3,8,"Ironic that your fate
"
,,
3,8,"is in the hands of an infant.
"
,,
3,8," Now tell me where my tricycle is!
"
,,
3,8," I don't know. I lost it.
"
,,
3,8," Agh!
"
,,
3,8," I have other ways of obtaining the truth.
"
,,
3,8,"No! Don't!
"
,,
3,8," Stewie? Look what I found.
"
,,
3,8," My trikey!
"
,,
3,8," What's going on down here?
"
,,
3,8," We're playing house.
"
,,
3,8,"That boy is all tied up.
"
,,
3,8,"Roman Polanski's house.
"
,,
3,8,"Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker.
"
,,
3,8,"Our top story: The president has been shot.
"
,,
3,8,"Tragedy strikes the nation.
"
,,
3,8,"The president has been shot.
"
,,
3,8,"Why's the president in this casket?
"
,,
3,8,"We'll tell you.
"
,,
3,8," Nice job on that report last night.
"
,,
3,8," Wow! Thanks, Mr Tucker.
"
,,
3,8,"That means so much coming
"
,,
3,8,"from someone so handsome.
"
,,
3,8," How'd you like to pick up my dry-cleaning?
"
,,
3,8," Sure. But isn't that Neil's job?
"
,,
3,8," Little jerk hasn't been in all day.
"
,,
3,8," He hasn't?
"
,,
3,8,"A breaking story! A geek is on top of
"
,,
3,8,"Town Hall! He's about to jump!
"
,,
3,8," Oh, my God! Neil!
"
,,
3,8," Is it Neil?
"
,,
3,8,"I've been calling him Ned all week.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, my God! Neil, please don't jump.
"
,,
3,8,"I was just a piece of eye candy
"
,,
3,8,"that she turned into an all-day sucker.
"
,,
3,8,"Mr Tucker! Thank God you're here!
"
,,
3,8,"Someone's got to do something! He'll fall!
"
,,
3,8,"I'm on it. Have that cartoon sound-effect
"
,,
3,8,"guy cue up the...
"
,,
3,8,"Top it off with a...
"
,,
3,8,"And if there's time, be ready with a...
"
,,
3,8,"""Wah, wah, wah, wah.
"
,,
3,8,"You don't care about him at all, do you?
"
,,
3,8,"All you care about are your stupid ratings!
"
,,
3,8,"You're a horrible man!
"
,,
3,8," Neil, I'm sorry!
"
,,
3,8," Meg?
"
,,
3,8," There he goes!
"
,,
3,8," Good stuff, good stuff, good stuff!
"
,,
3,8,"Neil!
"
,,
3,8," Meg! You do care!
"
,,
3,8," Don't read too much into this, Neil.
"
,,
3,8,"It's hard not to when I'm lying
"
,,
3,8,"right on top of you.
"
,,
3,8,"Just because you're repulsive and
"
,,
3,8,"the most annoying person on the planet,
"
,,
3,8,"and I'm not the only one who thinks so,
"
,,
3,8,"doesn't mean I want you to kill yourself.
"
,,
3,8,"Thanks, Meg. But I was never
"
,,
3,8,"really planning to jump.
"
,,
3,8,"Wasn't gonna jump? You're a phony!
"
,,
3,8,"Hey, everybody!

3,8,"Yeah!
"
,,
3,8,"Question number one:
"
,,
3,8,"Would you consider growing a moustache?
"
,,
3,8,"I guess so.
"
,,
3,8,"Question two: Look at my moustache.
"
,,
3,8,"Do you think it tickles women
"
,,
3,8,"when I kiss them?
"
,,
3,8,"I don't know.
"
,,
3,8,"Wrong. The answer is: Only slightly,
"

3,8,"only slightly. Next.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, God, I can't hire any of these girls.
"
,,
3,8,"They're all too pretty.

3,8,"Their breasts are too perky.

3,8," Great! Who's my partner?
"
,,
3,8," Hey, there, hot stuff!
"
,,
3,8,"Well, well. It appears the Fates
"
,,
3,8,"have conspired in our favour. Eh, Meg?
"
,,
3,8,"Stay away from me, Neil.
"
,,
3,8,"Just because we're working together
"
,,
3,8,"does not mean I like you. Give it to me!
"
,,
3,8," What's that?
"
,,
3,8," Give it to me, Neil.
"
,,
3,8," Give it to me! Give it to me, Neil.
"
,,
3,8," Yeah. That'll work just fine.

"
,,
3,8,"I gotta say, you look great.
"
,,
3,8,"Are you trying to seduce me?
"
,,
3,8,"I am not trying to seduce you,
"
,,
3,8,"Dustin Hoffman. You really look great.
"
,,
3,8," Uh-oh. Twelve minutes to Wapner.
"
,,
3,8," I understand your hectic schedule.
"
,,
3,8,"We appreciate you taking the time
"
,,
3,8,"to be with us here in the studio.
"
,,
3,8," If there's anything I can ever do for you...
"
,,
3,8," Bring me Peter Pan!
"
,,
3,8,"I'll keep my eye out for him.
"
,,
3,8,"Thanks, Dustin.

"
,,
3,8,"taught me about Columbus.
"
,,
3,8," Where are we going?
"
,,
3,8," We're going to visit the year 1492.
"
,,
3,8,"That's when Columbus set sail
"
,,
3,8,"for the New World.
"
,,
3,8," We're on a ship.
"
,,
3,8," This is the Santa Maria.
"
,,
3,8,"Columbus took it to find a route to India.
"
,,
3,8," Any sign of India yet?
"
,,
3,8," Nothing yet.
"
,,
3,8,"Columbus was going to America.
"
,,
3,8,"Columbus discovered America
"
,,
3,8,"entirely by mistake.
"
,,
3,8,"Wow!
"
,,
3,8," What are you doing? Back off, fat man.
"
,,
3,8," Hang on, Stewie.
"
,,
3,8,"What the...? Hey, hey, let go.
"
,,
3,8,"Get your filthy paws off.
"
,,
3,8,"Let go. Let go, I say. Let go. Don't let go!
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, this is exhilarating.
"
,,
3,8," Go, Stewie!
"
,,
3,8," Yay, Stewie!
"
,,
3,8,"I gotta go check on dinner. You keep
"
,,
3,8,"taping Stewie. Don't miss a moment.
"
,,
3,8,"I got it.
"
,,
3,8,"Look, it's dancing with me.
"
,,
3,8,"It's this incredibly benevolent force
"
,,
3,8,"that wants me to know
"
,,
3,8,"there's no reason to be afraid.
"
,,
3,8,"Sometimes there's so much beauty
"
,,
3,8,"in the world, it makes my heart burst.
"
,,
3,8,"It's just some trash blowing in the wind!
"
,,
3,8,"Do you have any idea how complicated
"
,,
3,8,"your circulatory system is?
"
,,
3,8,"Hi, Mr Tucker. I brought you Rice Crispy
"
,,
3,8,"Treats. I remember you said you liked them.
"
,,
3,8,"Look. This one is in the shape of a heart.
"
,,
3,8,"I'm sorry, but there's a handsome man
"
,,
3,8,"in my spoon. Come back later.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, my God.
"
,,
3,8,"Meg's in love with Tom Tucker!
"
,,
3,8,"Try to move in on my woman,
"
,,
3,8,"will you, Tom Tucker?
"
,,
3,8,"No one crosses Neil Goldman
"
,,
3,8,"and gets away with it.
"
,,
3,8,"I added something to your coffee
"
,,
3,8,"I don't think you're gonna like.
"
,,
3,8," Here's your coffee, Mr Tucker.
"
,,
3,8," What the hell is in this?
"
,,
3,8,"Sweet'N Low.
"
,,

"

3,8," Bring it to me with urine in it like I asked.
"
,,
3,8," Yes, sir.
"
,,
3,8," Nice bike.
"
,,
3,8," That's the understatement of the century.
"
,,
3,8," It's cool. Too cool for you.
"
,,
3,8," No, no. I think it's right where I'm at.
"
,,
3,8,"Out of my way!
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, I see. Oh, yes, I suppose you do have
"
,,
3,8,"to ride it to truly appreciate its virtues.
"
,,
3,8,"Well, then, I'll just wait
"
,,
3,8,"right here till you get back.
"
,,
3,8," Where the devil is he?
"
,,
3,8," You've obviously never met a bully.
"
,,
3,8,"What do you mean?
"
,,
3,8,"He wasn't taking it for a test ride,
"
,,
3,8,"he was just taking it.
"
,,
3,8," You... you mean...?
"
,,
3,8," Mm-hm.
"
,,
3,8,"He... stole... my trikey?
"
,,
3,8,"Mr Tucker, has anyone
"
,,
3,8,"ever told you your eyes are...
"
,,
3,8,"Hang on, sweetie. I've gotta call Peter
"
,,
3,8,"Jennings and reschedule our golf game.
"
,,
3,8,"This is Peter. You know what to do.
"
,,
3,8,"Mr Tucker, Miss Simmons, there's a nut on
"
,,
3,8,"top of Town Hall with a high-powered rifle.
"
,,
3,8,"The gunman's been identified as the
"
,,
3,8,"Mass Media Murderer who targets the press.
"
,,
3,8,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Mass Media Murderer?
"
,,
3,8,"I think this would be a fine opportunity
"
,,
3,8,"to give our interns real-world experience.
"
,,
3,8,"That means you'll get to ride
"
,,
3,8,"in the news chopper. I'm so jealous.
"
,,
3,8,"Better put in for some new interns.
"
,,
3,8,"Good luck!
"

"

3,8," I'm Hugh Downs. I know everybody.
"

3,8," In fact, he's down there.
"

3,8," Where?
"

3,8,"Ha-ha! See ya later, sucker! And by the way,
"
,,
3,8,"Rather is an OK guy in small doses.
"
,,
3,8,"Look how close we're getting, Meg.
"
,,
3,8,"Hey! That was my lucky assassin hat!
"
,,
3,8,"Mayday! Mayday! I'm going down!
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, my God, we're gonna die! There's
"
,,
3,8,"so much of life I haven't experienced!
"
,,
3,8,"I never got the chance to be some
"
,,
3,8,"drunk college guy's last resort!
"
,,
3,8,"My years of expensive orthodontic work
"
,,
3,8,"will be a total waste!

3,8," I never even had my first kiss!
"
,,
3,8," It's not too late, Meg.
"
,,
3,8,"I'm here for you.
"
,,
3,8,"Time to sign off.
"
,,
3,8,"Remember me, dirt bag?
"
,,
3,8,"Wow! You saved
"
,,
3,8,"those kids' lives, Mr Downs.
"
,,
3,8,"All in a day's work. If you ever need me,
"
,,
3,8,"just blow this whistle,
"
,,
3,8,"or call John Stossel's cellphone.
"
,,
3,8,"Hugh Downs away!
"
,,
3,8,"Honey, thank God you're safe.
"
,,
3,8,"We were so worried.
"
,,
3,8,"We now go to junior anchor Neil Goldman
"
,,
3,8,"with exclusive footage
"
,,
3,8,"from today's exciting scene.
"
,,
3,8,"Thank you, Diane. There may have been
"
,,
3,8,"some commotion on the rooftop,
"
,,
3,8,"but the real story was inside the mouths
"
,,
3,8,"of Meg Griffin and Neil Goldman,
"
,,
3,8,"where a meeting of the tongues,
"
,,
3,8,"a summit of saliva,
"
,,
3,8,"established a new world order of love.
"
,,
3,8,"Agh!
"
,,
3,8,"Let's watch it one more time
"
,,
3,8,"in super slow-mo.
"
,,
3,8,"This is where we cease to be Meg and Neil
"
,,
3,8,"and begin life anew as Meil.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, my God. He put it on TV?
"
,,
3,8,"Isn't that cute, Peter?
"
,,
3,8,"Our daughter's first love.
"
,,
3,8,"I just want to kill myself! I'm going upstairs
"
,,
3,8,"right now and eat a whole bowl of peanuts.
"
,,
3,8,"I'm allergic to peanuts!
"
,,
3,8,"You don't know anything about me!
"
,,
3,8,"Who was that guy?
"
,,
3,8,"Constable, I'd like to report
"
,,
3,8,"the theft of my tricycle.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, look at the little baby.
"
,,
3,8,"Aren't you cute! Where's your mommy?
"
,,
3,8,"How dare you condescend to me?
"
,,
3,8,"I demand justice!
"
,,
3,8,"I'm here to turn myself in. I have
"
,,
3,8,"a dismembered hooker bleeding in my trunk.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, look at the little baby.
"
,,
3,8,"Aren't you cute! Where's your mommy?
"
,,
3,8," Where did you get that shirt?
"
,,
3,8," From Neil.
"
,,
3,8,"Hello, lover.
"
,,
3,8,"Neil, what are you doing?
"
,,
3,8,"I'm not your lover. I don't even like you.
"
,,
3,8,"Meg, I strongly suggest you hold
"
,,
3,8,"my hand, lest you look like a slut.
"
,,
3,8,"Tell these people that there's
"
,,
3,8,"nothing going on between us.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, don't be afraid of the fire, Meg.
"
,,
3,8,"I won't let you burn.
"
,,
3,8,"Al, why haven't I leaped?
"
,,
3,8,"Ziggy says you can't leap
"
,,
3,8,"until she loves you back.
"
,,
3,8,"Don't worry, I'll get her.
"
,,
3,8,"What do you want to work on?
"
,,
3,8,"Cardio? Upper body?
"
,,
3,8,"Upper body. I need to get buff,
"
,,
3,8,"so I can get my tricycle back.
"
,,
3,8,"Luckily, we're running a special
"
,,
3,8,"for the next 17 minutes.
"
,,
3,8,"OK. That's a little unusual but... OK, tell me.
"
,,
3,8,"The normal plan is 78 months
"
,,
3,8,"at 40 a month and 200 down. Watch this.
"
,,
3,8," Forget the down.
"
,,
3,8," Yeah.
"
,,
3,8,"Goodbye 40 a month, let's do 35.
"
,,
3,8," 35. That's the cheapest?
"
,,
3,8," Yeah, hang on, hang on.
"
,,
3,8,"Trace, can you bring me
"
,,
3,8,"some free gym bags?
"
,,
3,8,"I could probably just do
"
,,
3,8,"some push-ups at home.
"
,,
3,8,"Let's start you off with a body-fat test,
"
,,
3,8,"maybe a heart rate.
"
,,
3,8,"You're not hearing me. I don't think
"
,,
3,8,"this is for me. Thanks, anyway.
"
,,
3,8,"And for the future,
"
,,
3,8,"you came on a little strong.
"
,,
3,8," What's going on here?
"
,,
3,8," We invited Neil's family over for dinner.
"
,,
3,8," Hi.
"
,,
3,8," Hello.
"
,,
3,8," You what?!
"
,,
3,8," To get to know 'em better.
"
,,
3,8,"Seeing as you two
"
,,
3,8,"will one day bless our home
"
,,
3,8,"with the pitter-patter
"
,,
3,8,"of grandchildren as ugly as sin.
"
,,
3,8,"Meg, you never told me your mother
"
,,
3,8,"was such a stone-cold fox.
"
,,
3,8," Now I see where you get it.
"
,,
3,8," Meg, he's so charming.
"
,,
3,8,"My name is Chris.
"
,,
3,8,"I'm supposed to be on my best behaviour
"
,,
3,8,"tonight and not mention poo.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, God, what have I done?!
"
,,
3,8,"Well, let's eat.
"
,,
3,8,"I think it's very, very nice that our children
"
,,
3,8,"had this wonderful kiss.
"
,,
3,8,"I remember when Muriel and I had
"
,,
3,8,"our first kiss, and it was just awful.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, just awful. We were both very sick.
"
,,
3,8,"Weren't we, dear?
"
,,
3,8,"Ugh, we were terribly sick.
"
,,
3,8,"We were both 14 and it was winter
"
,,
3,8,"and we had terrible head colds.
"
,,
3,8,"Mine especially was very bad. I had terrible
"
,,
3,8,"mucus coming out from inside my nose.
"
,,
3,8,"And the other children,
"
,,
3,8,"they were very nasty to me.
"
,,
3,8,"They said bad, hurtful things to me.
"
,,
3,8,"They called me Tasty Cakes,
"
,,
3,8,"and they would beat me
"
,,
3,8,"and stick pine cones in my ass.
"
,,
3,8," Those were very bad times.
"
,,
3,8," I'm sorry to hear that.
"
,,
3,8,"Thank you very much.
"
,,
3,8,"Excuse me. I'm gonna go throw up.
"
,,
3,8,"Please flush the toilet twice.
"
,,
3,8,"Once for the bulk, and again for the
"
,,
3,8,"remainder. Thank you. Oh, she's a dear.
"
,,
3,8,"You're blocking my light, you stupid baby!
"
,,
3,8,"My hooligan friend,
"
,,
3,8,"I've been racking my brain
"
,,
3,8,"in a fruitless attempt
"
,,
3,8,"to resolve our unpleasantness.
"
,,
3,8,"But then it dawned on me. Your cruelty
"
,,
3,8,"merely stems from a deep-seated inner pain.
"
,,
3,8,"The obvious remedy
"
,,
3,8,"is a healthy dose of outer pain!
"
,,
3,8,"Children washing cars to raise money
"
,,
3,8,"for charity. Is anything more arousing?
"
,,
3,8,"We go to Meg Griffin for a special Channel
"
,,
3,8,"Five junior anchor segment on the moon.
"
,,
3,8,"The moon. There's a reason
"
,,
3,8,"no one goes there. It's cold, and it's ugly.
"
,,
3,8,"Its surface is plagued
"
,,
3,8,"with craters and jagged peaks.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, wait! That's not the moon.
"
,,
3,8,"It's Neil Goldman's face.
"
,,
3,8,"Recently, many of you saw me
"
,,
3,8,"kissing this freak of nature.
"
,,
3,8,"If I wasn't seconds away from death,
"
,,
3,8,"I wouldn't have done it.
"
,,
3,8,"I mean, who in their right mind would?
"
,,
3,8,"I went to the streets to find out.
"
,,
3,8,"Would you kiss this guy?
"
,,
3,8," Ugh! No!
"
,,
3,8," No way!
"
,,
3,8," No!
"
,,
3,8," No!
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, God, no!
"
,,
3,8,"What's the matter with you? Oh!
"
,,
3,8,"It's official. Neil Goldman isn't kissable.
"
,,
3,8,"Hear that, Neil? I don't like you.
"
,,
3,8,"I never will! Back to you, Tom.
"
,,
3,8,"Thank you, Meg. I guess beggars
"
,,
3,8,"can be choosers. And now this.
"
,,
3,8," Well, well. Isn't this a darling picture!
"
,,
3,8," Let me go, man!
"
,,
3,8," How old are you, Charlie?
"
,,
3,8," Seven.
"
,,
3,8,"Seven? Well, my, my.
"
,,
3,8,"You're practically a lady.
"
,,
3,8,"Ironic that your fate
"
,,
3,8,"is in the hands of an infant.
"
,,
3,8," Now tell me where my tricycle is!
"
,,
3,8," I don't know. I lost it.
"
,,
3,8," Agh!
"
,,
3,8," I have other ways of obtaining the truth.
"
,,
3,8,"No! Don't!
"
,,
3,8," Stewie? Look what I found.
"
,,
3,8," My trikey!
"
,,
3,8," What's going on down here?
"
,,
3,8," We're playing house.
"
,,
3,8,"That boy is all tied up.
"
,,
3,8,"Roman Polanski's house.
"
,,
3,8,"Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker.
"
,,
3,8,"Our top story: The president has been shot.
"
,,
3,8,"Tragedy strikes the nation.
"
,,
3,8,"The president has been shot.
"
,,
3,8,"Why's the president in this casket?
"
,,
3,8,"We'll tell you.
"
,,
3,8," Nice job on that report last night.
"
,,
3,8," Wow! Thanks, Mr Tucker.
"
,,
3,8,"That means so much coming
"
,,
3,8,"from someone so handsome.
"
,,
3,8," How'd you like to pick up my dry-cleaning?
"
,,
3,8," Sure. But isn't that Neil's job?
"
,,
3,8," Little jerk hasn't been in all day.
"
,,
3,8," He hasn't?
"
,,
3,8,"A breaking story! A geek is on top of
"
,,
3,8,"Town Hall! He's about to jump!
"
,,
3,8," Oh, my God! Neil!
"
,,
3,8," Is it Neil?
"
,,
3,8,"I've been calling him Ned all week.
"
,,
3,8,"Oh, my God! Neil, please don't jump.
"
,,
3,8,"I was just a piece of eye candy
"
,,
3,8,"that she turned into an all-day sucker.
"
,,
3,8,"Mr Tucker! Thank God you're here!
"
,,
3,8,"Someone's got to do something! He'll fall!
"
,,
3,8,"I'm on it. Have that cartoon sound-effect
"
,,
3,8,"guy cue up the...
"
,,
3,8,"Top it off with a...
"
,,
3,8,"And if there's time, be ready with a...
"
,,
3,8,"""Wah, wah, wah, wah.
"
,,
3,8,"You don't care about him at all, do you?
"
,,
3,8,"All you care about are your stupid ratings!
"
,,
3,8,"You're a horrible man!
"
,,
3,8," Neil, I'm sorry!
"
,,
3,8," Meg?
"
,,
3,8," There he goes!
"
,,
3,8," Good stuff, good stuff, good stuff!
"
,,
3,8,"Neil!
"
,,
3,8," Meg! You do care!
"
,,
3,8," Don't read too much into this, Neil.
"
,,
3,8,"It's hard not to when I'm lying
"
,,
3,8,"right on top of you.
"
,,
3,8,"Just because you're repulsive and
"
,,
3,8,"the most annoying person on the planet,
"
,,
3,8,"and I'm not the only one who thinks so,
"
,,
3,8,"doesn't mean I want you to kill yourself.
"
,,
3,8,"Thanks, Meg. But I was never
"
,,
3,8,"really planning to jump.
"
,,
3,8,"Wasn't gonna jump? You're a phony!
"

3,8,"Hey, everybody!

"
,,
3,9,"Ah. Peter, it's OK. It's just Death.
"
,,
3,9,"Ah, thank God.
"
,,
3,9," Did someone choke on a roll in here?
"
,,
3,9," No, no, no. I spit it up.
"
,,
3,9,"Oh.
"
,,
3,9,"Our top story:
"
,,
3,9,"Doreen, I lost your phone number.
"
,,
3,9,"We met at the Sky Lounge
"
,,
3,9,"last night. Call me.
"
,,
3,9,"In other news, toy industrialist
"
,,
3,9,"Jonathan Weed was found dead
"
,,
3,9,"in the home of an employee
"
,,
3,9,"who claims Weed choked on a roll.
"
,,
3,9,"No charges will be filed against
"
,,
3,9,"the employee, but the roll is in custody.
"
,,
3,9,"I'd do her, do her, wouldn't do her.
"
,,
3,9,"Ech, who hasn't done her? Do her.
"
,,
3,9,"Lose the pigtails and we'll talk.
"
,,
3,9,"Do her, do her...
"
,,
3,9,"And now, the last man to see Jonathan Weed
"
,,
3,9,"alive has offered to say a few words.
"
,,
3,9,"Good afternoon.
"
,,
3,9,"As you know, we of the Christian faith
"
,,
3,9,"believe that Jesus is not really dead,
"
,,
3,9,"but that he must let
"
,,
3,9,"the world think he is dead
"
,,
3,9,"until he can find a way to control
"
,,
3,9,"the raging spirit that dwells within him.
"
,,
3,9,"Anyway, before he died, Mr Weed
"
,,
3,9,"promoted me to head of toy development.
"
,,
3,9,"I brought my attorney who confirms
"
,,
3,9,"that this constitutes a verbal contract.
"
,,
3,9,"Isn't that right, Saul?
"
,,
3,9,"""Yes, sir. "" Thank you.
"
,,
3,9,"Glad you all found your way
"
,,
3,9,"from the cemetery.
"
,,
3,9,"I'm Mr Weed's lawyer. We found this tape
"
,,
3,9,"among Mr Weed's personal effects
"
,,
3,9,"with instructions that it be screened
"
,,
3,9,"immediately after his funeral. Enjoy.
"
,,
3,9,"Good morning. Camera time.
"
,,
3,9," Turn that off. I don't have my face on yet.
"
,,
3,9," You want to tell us what you're making?
"
,,
3,9,"It's just a couple of eggs with
"
,,
3,9,"the peppers left over from last night.
"
,,
3,9," Mm...
"
,,
3,9," Yes.
"
,,
3,9,"OK, playtime is over.
"
,,
3,9,"Turn it off, monkey, OK?
"
,,
3,9,"Ahem.
"
,,
3,9,"Hello, friends. If you are watching this,
"
,,
3,9,"I am dead, and I bet you're pretty bummed.
"
,,
3,9," But I have good news.
"
,,
3,9," Yeah?
"
,,
3,9,"The Happy-Go-Lucky Toy Factory
"
,,
3,9,"shall be torn down
"
,,
3,9,"to make way for the Happy-Go-Lucky
"
,,
3,9,"Terminal Disease Institute.
"
,,
3,9," What?!
"
,,
3,9," The demolition will begin in... now.
"
,,
3,9,"OK, we've got your typing test here
"
,,
3,9,"and all the pertinent data
"
,,
3,9,"about your, um...
"
,,
3,9,"um, you know, your background
"
,,
3,9,"and, um... skills and...
"
,,
3,9," And?
"
,,
3,9," I gotta be honest with you.
"
,,
3,9,"I only have another week and a half here,
"
,,
3,9,"and I have completely checked out.
"
,,
3,9," Oh.
"
,,
3,9," Yeah.
"
,,
3,9,"Well, what should I do?
"
,,
3,9,"Um...
"
,,
3,9,"Chef?
"
,,
3,9,"Sorry, we're out of towels.
"
,,
3,9,"Let me get that for you, sir.
"
,,
3,9,"I should pay two bucks for stickers
"
,,
3,9,"cos this guy can't hear? Come on!
"
,,
3,9,"Hey, I might be deaf, but I have feelings!
"
,,
3,9,"Oh, uh... I mean, what?
"
,,
3,9," Has Dad found a permanent job yet?
"
,,
3,9," He's going through a career transition.
"
,,
3,9,"He's sampling a few things, searching
"
,,
3,9,"for something that fits him just right.
"
,,
3,9," Clearly it's not that tube top.
"
,,
3,9," Looking for a good time, sweet cheeks?
"
,,
3,9," Oh, my God.
"
,,
3,9," Peter, get in the car!
"
,,
3,9,"OK, but it'll cost ya.
"
,,
3,9,"You want a Cleveland Steamer?
"
,,
3,9,"Get in the car...
"
,,
3,9,"What's a Cleveland Steamer?
"
,,
3,9," It means he'll...
"
,,
3,9," Whoa, be cool.
"
,,
3,9,"Yes, you go to Maple Street,
"
,,
3,9,"and then take a left, and then you go...
"
,,
3,9," So you want to party or what?
"
,,
3,9," Get in right now!
"
,,
3,9,"It's eerie, isn't it?
"
,,
3,9,"Like looking into the future.
"
,,
3,9," Forgetful Freddy was so forgetful...
"
,,
3,9," How forgetful?
"
,,
3,9,"He was so forgetful, whenever he tried
"
,,
3,9,"to remember a name, he drew a... ""blank"".
"
,,
3,9,"This is all my fault. If I hadn't pushed you
"
,,
3,9,"so hard to invite Mr Weed to dinner,
"
,,
3,9,"he'd still be alive and you'd have your job.
"
,,
3,9,"We'll get through this.
"
,,
3,9,"We just have to scrimp a little.
"
,,
3,9,"Sell some stuff we don't really need.
"
,,
3,9," This'll bring in a couple of bucks.
"
,,
3,9," Peter, listen.
"
,,
3,9,"When we got married, you always talked
"
,,
3,9,"about your dream job. Remember?
"
,,
3,9,"You put that dream aside
"
,,
3,9,"in order to provide for this family.
"
,,
3,9," Yeah.
"
,,
3,9," I've saved some money from teaching piano,
"
,,
3,9,"and this is the perfect time
"
,,
3,9,"for you to pursue that dream.
"
,,
3,9," Really?
"
,,
3,9," Yes!
"
,,
3,9,"Wow. Since money's tight, I was gonna
"
,,
3,9,"suggest that we eat the kids.
"
,,
3,9,"Jokingly at first, but then
"
,,
3,9,"I was gonna gauge your reaction.
"
,,
3,9,"If you were cool with it, we could go
"
,,
3,9,"from there. But this is a much better idea!
"
,,
3,9,"I'm gonna do it!
"
,,
3,9,"I'm gonna realise my dream!
"
,,
3,9,"I am gonna be a Renaissance Fair jouster!
"
,,
3,9,"Oh, Peter!
"
,,
3,9,"Aaaghhh!
"
,,
3,9,"This is so exciting!
"
,,
3,9,"My little jouster's first day.
"
,,
3,9," Here's your lunch.
"
,,
3,9," Thanks, honey. Aw, egg salad!
"
,,
3,9," Have a good time.
"
,,
3,9," I'll try.
"
,,
3,9," Hey, Mort.
"
,,
3,9," Oh, God! Don't hurt me!
"
,,
3,9," Oh, hi, Peter.
"
,,
3,9," You gonna be a jouster, too?
"
,,
3,9,"Yes. I'm trying to overcome
"
,,
3,9,"my fear of swords
"
,,
3,9,"because a man in a pirate suit
"
,,
3,9,"stabbed me in the ear when I was five,
"
,,
3,9,"and then again when I was 30.
"
,,
3,9,"And you? The same?
"
,,
3,9,"Nah, not really. It kinda
"
,,
3,9,"all goes back to when I was 18.
"
,,
3,9,"I was going through that rebellious phase,
"
,,
3,9,"and I was hanging out with a bad crowd.
"
,,
3,9,"Here, Peter. Try one of these.
"
,,
3,9," What is it?
"
,,
3,9," It's a cheeseburger.
"
,,
3,9,"Now I know it wasn't a cheeseburger.
"
,,
3,9,"But at that time,
"
,,
3,9,"I was ready to believe anything.
"
,,
3,9,"I didn't know what was going on.
"
,,
3,9,"I wandered around and ended up
"
,,
3,9,"at the Renaissance Fair.
"
,,
3,9," I can fly!
"
,,
3,9," Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,9,"I was saved by the one and only Black
"
,,
3,9,"Knight of the Quahog Renaissance Fair.
"
,,
3,9,"A word of advice. The path to knighthood
"
,,
3,9,"is paved with strength and nobility,
"
,,
3,9,"not LSD and sideburns.
"
,,
3,9,"And from that moment on, I knew
"
,,
3,9,"someday I wanted to be a knight like him.
"
,,
3,9,"Mercy! I was once addicted
"
,,
3,9,"to antihistamines.
"
,,
3,9,"I took so many, I thought I was Mr Peanut.
"
,,
3,9,"Yeah, that's a great story, too.
"
,,
3,9,"So, you think you got
"
,,
3,9,"what it takes to be jousters!
"
,,
3,9,"If you're gonna joust, you gotta want it!
"
,,
3,9,"Let me hear your war cry!
"
,,
3,9,"Is that the best you got, you pile of crap?
"
,,
3,9,"Yes. From an early age,
"
,,
3,9,"my parents discouraged loud noises.
"
,,
3,9,"You're a candy-ass maggot!
"
,,
3,9," Something funny, maggot?
"
,,
3,9," No, sir!
"
,,
3,9," You love the Middle Ages, don't you?
"
,,
3,9," Sir, yes, sir!
"
,,
3,9,"The concept of a geocentric universe
"
,,
3,9,"gets you sexually excited, doesn't it?
"
,,
3,9,"Yes, sir!
"
,,
3,9,"You want to make 16th-century
"
,,
3,9,"mathematician Johannes Kepler your bitch?
"
,,
3,9,"Sir, yes, sir!
"
,,
3,9," Welcome, apprentices.
"
,,
3,9," It's him.
"
,,
3,9,"Look alive. Allow me to introduce the best
"
,,
3,9,"of the best, the Black Knight himself!
"
,,
3,9,"And this is his trophy wench,
"
,,
3,9,"Maid Madeleine.
"
,,
3,9,"Ding!
"
,,
3,9," Excuse me, Mr Black Knight.
"
,,
3,9," I'm busy.
"
,,
3,9,"I just wanted to thank you. I don't know
"
,,
3,9,"if you remember, but when I was a kid,
"
,,
3,9,"you helped me get my life back on track.
"
,,
3,9,"Agh! Dammit! Look, I'm busy, all right?
"
,,
3,9," OK, I'll come back later.
"
,,
3,9," Damn rookies.
"
,,
3,9,"Are all the other men
"
,,
3,9,"out of the shower yet?
"
,,
3,9,"Hey, porker. Yes, I'm calling you a porker,
"
,,
3,9,"and there's nothing you can do about it
"
,,
3,9,"because I'm protected by my
"
,,
3,9,"impenetrable cereal-box fort. Ha-ha-ha!
"
,,
3,9,"Hey, you! Drunkie.
"
,,
3,9,"Yes, I'm calling you drunkie, and
"
,,
3,9,"there's nothing you can do about it...
"
,,
3,9,"Agh!
"
,,
3,9," The toast is ready.
"
,,
3,9," I'll get it, Lois.
"
,,
3,9,"Here you go.
"
,,
3,9,"Maybe you shouldn't bring
"
,,
3,9,"your lance to the table.
"
,,
3,9,"If I'm gonna impress the Black Knight,
"
,,
3,9,"my lance must be with me at all times.
"
,,
3,9,"You guys will be so proud
"
,,
3,9,"when you see me on that field.
"
,,
3,9,"Excuse me. I gotta go practise.
"
,,
3,9,"Oh, my God, Dad, my earring!
"
,,
3,9,"Dad, stop! Argh!
"
,,
3,9,"Two mutton joints, please.
"
,,
3,9,"Oh, thou wishest to feast on
"
,,
3,9,"the appendage of a humble ovine.
"
,,
3,9,"Listen, freak. We don't all watch Frasier.
"
,,
3,9,"Now give me two mutton joints.
"
,,
3,9,"Thank you.
"
,,
3,9,"'Tis a glorious afternoon.
"
,,
3,9,"Wouldst thou not agree?
"
,,
3,9,"Uh, yea, kind shrew.
"
,,
3,9,"Uh, I before thee... except after C.
"
,,
3,9,"Wouldst thou take a gander
"
,,
3,9,"underneath my frock?
"
,,
3,9,"Uh, sure. Whatever floats your boat.
"
,,
3,9,"There you go.
"
,,
3,9,"Frickin' perverts.
"
,,
3,9,"Madeleine, go wait in the Hyundai!
"
,,
3,9,"What were you doing with my girl?
"
,,
3,9,"She walks over here and asks me to put a bird
"
,,
3,9,"in her panties! I'm going ""What the hell?""
"
,,
3,9,"Oh, God! Peter, play dead!
"
,,
3,9,"Curl up in an ass ball or something!
"
,,
3,9," What's the problem, BK?
"
,,
3,9," I don't like you.
"
,,
3,9,"And I don't like you hanging around my girl.
"
,,
3,9,"I don't ever want to see you here again.
"
,,
3,9,"Oh. OK, but we can see each other
"
,,
3,9,"outside the fair, right?
"
,,
3,9," I'm just trying to understand the rules.
"
,,
3,9," If I see you again, I'll kill you!
"
,,
3,9,"OK, that's much clearer.
"
,,
3,9,"Oh, God! I think I just miscarried!
"
,,
3,9,"What are you doing? I spent hours
"
,,
3,9,"soldering that costume for you.
"
,,
3,9,"I don't need it any more. I quit the team.
"
,,
3,9,"You can't quit jousting.
"
,,
3,9,"The big meet is today. I thought...
"
,,
3,9,"Did you just say ""big meat""?
"
,,
3,9,"Oh, my God, I did.
"
,,
3,9," We almost missed that.
"
,,
3,9," That was a close one.
"
,,
3,9,"But I'm being serious here. We were
"
,,
3,9,"all set to come see you joust today.
"
,,
3,9,"You were so excited to be
"
,,
3,9,"on the field with the Black Knight.
"
,,
3,9,"I'll be watching him from the stands,
"
,,
3,9,"because the Black Knight is a big jerk,
"
,,
3,9,"just like that guy who fixed our vacuum.
"
,,
3,9,"There you go. All fixed.
"
,,
3,9,"A half-eaten meatball was
"
,,
3,9,"clogging up the intake.
"
,,
3,9," Oh. Well, did you save it?
"
,,
3,9," Uh, no.
"
,,
3,9,"You bastard.
"
,,
3,9,"It's an exciting day here at
"
,,
3,9,"the Renaissance Fair, wouldn't you say, Tom?
"
,,
3,9,"It would be if you didn't remind us all
"
,,
3,9,"of our grandmother's cleavage.
"
,,
3,9,"Let's go to the field, where the Black Knight
"
,,
3,9,"prepares to challenge his opponent.
"
,,
3,9,"""Ohh...
"
,,
3,9,"""Hey
"
,,
3,9,"""Ohh...
"
,,
3,9,"""Hey
"
,,
3,9,"Hey, how you doing there, big guy?
"
,,
3,9,"You holding up all right?
"
,,
3,9,"You want a soda? Hm?
"
,,
3,9,"Oh, screw it. I tried.
"
,,
3,9,"The Black Knight's next challenger
"
,,
3,9,"is Sir Mort Goldman.
"
,,
3,9,"Oh, God! I forfeit!
"
,,
3,9,"That's it. The Black Knight is out of
"
,,
3,9,"challengers and is once again undefeated.
"
,,
3,9,"Hey, what's your fat ass doing here?
"
,,
3,9,"He's my only means of conveyance.
"
,,
3,9," But I guess I do spoil him.
"
,,
3,9," Clearly you do.
"
,,
3,9,"And what are you doing here, Griffin?
"
,,
3,9,"I told you never to come here again!
"
,,
3,9," I don't want any trouble.
"
,,
3,9," You've got trouble if you don't beat it.
"
,,
3,9," Listen, buddy...
"
,,
3,9," I said get lost!
"
,,
3,9," Where's he going?
"
,,
3,9," Let him go, kids.
"
,,
3,9,"You see that, kids?
"
,,
3,9,"Your father's nothing but a fizzle!
"
,,
3,9,"Nobody calls me a fizzle
"
,,
3,9,"and gets away with it!
"
,,
3,9,"Except that guy who called me a fizzle
"
,,
3,9,"and then ran off. He got away with it.
"
,,
3,9,"But most people who call me that
"
,,
3,9,"don't get away with it.
"
,,
3,9,"Actually, that guy was the only one
"
,,
3,9,"who ever called me a fizzle.
"
,,
3,9,"After today, only half the people who called
"
,,
3,9,"me a fizzle will have gotten away with it.
"
,,
3,9,"A new challenger has entered the field.
"
,,
3,9,"The crowd has fallen deathly ill.
"
,,
3,9,"Silent. Sorry.
"
,,
3,9,"Oh, my God, I'm gonna die!
"
,,
3,9,"To the owner of a yellow Hyundai,
"
,,
3,9,"your car is being towed.
"
,,
3,9,"What?
"
,,
3,9,"I won!
"
,,
3,9," Peter, that was amazing. You were so brave.
"
,,
3,9," Nice going, Dad.
"
,,
3,9,"Boy, that was lucky about the car.
"
,,
3,9,"Take that, you bastard! Nobody
"
,,
3,9,"makes a fool out of Mort Goldman!
"
,,
3,9,"Spectacular, maggot! How'd you like
"
,,
3,9,"to travel with us as our lead jouster?
"
,,
3,9,"Thanks, but no thanks, Coach.
"
,,
3,9,"I've lived my dream.
"
,,
3,9,"And besides, my life is here with my family.
"
,,
3,9,"But, Mom, what's Dad gonna do for a job?
"
,,
3,9,"Lt'll be OK, Chris. Remember
"
,,
3,9,"that episode of The Honeymooners
"
,,
3,9,"when Ralph lost his job but didn't get it back?
"
,,
3,9,"Yeah, why was that?
"
,,
3,9,"That bugged the crap out of me.

3,10,"something you enjoy doing.
"
,,
3,10," Take those guys out there, for example.
"
,,
3,10," Where?
"
,,
3,10,"Oh, yeah. Now, that's a job.
"
,,
3,10,"Fresh sea air, working outside.
"
,,
3,10,"That's how a real New England man
"
,,
3,10,"makes a living.
"
,,
3,10," That's something to think about.
"
,,
3,10," What's that, Daddy?
"
,,
3,10,"That's Mercury, Jake,
"
,,
3,10,"the planet closest to the sun.
"
,,
3,10,"What it's doing by the wharf,
"
,,
3,10,"we should ask a scientist...
"
,,
3,10,"I'm a guy, you jackass!
"
,,
3,10,"Ah, yeah, that feels good.
"
,,
3,10,"Chris, don't forget to mist under his chins.
"
,,
3,10,"Oh, boy, Lois. It's a real mess down there.
"
,,
3,10,"I'm afraid I'm won't be able
"
,,
3,10,"to do this in the time I quoted.
"
,,
3,10,"Chris, shut the hose off for a second.
"
,,
3,10,"I have an announcement.
"
,,
3,10,"I am gonna drop this weight
"
,,
3,10,"and rejoin the workforce.
"
,,
3,10,"I have decided to become
"
,,
3,10,"a professional fisherman.
"
,,
3,10,"What? Why a fisherman?
"
,,
3,10,"It makes sense. You know
"
,,
3,10,"how much time I've spent on the ocean.
"
,,
3,10,"Wilson! What are we gonna do now?!
"
,,
3,10," Wilson! Wilson!
"
,,
3,10," My name is Voit, dumb-ass.
"
,,
3,10,"Hello, Doreen?
"
,,
3,10,"I'm still over at the Griffin job.
"
,,
3,10,"Tell Walter I won't be able
"
,,
3,10,"to make it to the construction site.
"
,,
3,10,"So... I don't know. Have him send
"
,,
3,10,"Frank or Glen or Harelip Steve.
"
,,
3,10,"I know, it creeps me out, too.
"
,,
3,10,"So you think I can find a boat here?
"
,,
3,10,"You wouldn't believe what we
"
,,
3,10,"confiscate from these crooks.
"
,,
3,10,"We open today's bidding with this pair
"
,,
3,10,"of panties confiscated from a prostitute.
"
,,
3,10," 50 bucks!
"
,,
3,10," She had nine STD's.
"
,,
3,10," 45 bucks.
"
,,
3,10," And when we caught her, she wet herself.
"
,,
3,10," 50 bucks.
"
,,
3,10," Will you sell anything that's not gross?
"
,,
3,10,"Please direct your attention to this photo
"
,,
3,10,"of a beautiful 40-foot fishing boat.
"
,,
3,10," Oh, man, that's perfect!
"
,,
3,10," $12,000.
"
,,
3,10," $13,000.
"
,,
3,10," $25,000.
"
,,
3,10," Sold for $25,000.
"
,,
3,10," Yes!
"
,,
3,10," Aw, crap!
"
,,
3,10," Thanks.
"
,,
3,10,"And now the actual boat itself.
"
,,
3,10,"Do I have an opening bid for the boat?
"
,,
3,10," $50,000!
"
,,
3,10," Sold for $50,000.
"
,,
3,10,"Good for you, Peter.
"
,,
3,10,"Congratulations.
"
,,
3,10,"You've bought yourself a cursed boat.
"
,,
3,10," Cursed?
"
,,
3,10," The last captain of that vessel lost his life.
"
,,
3,10,"And it weren't no accident!
"
,,
3,10,"His name was Salty.
"
,,
3,10,"And he was devoured by Daggermouth,
"
,,
3,10,"the man-eating bluefish.
"
,,
3,10,"You want to buy that boat?
"
,,
3,10,"Go ahead, take it.
"
,,
3,10,"Don't expect me to fish your dead body
"
,,
3,10,"from an angry sea
"
,,
3,10,"that gave you fair warning.
"
,,
3,10,"Are you up for bids, too?
"
,,
3,10,"You are just precious.
"
,,
3,10," Are you gonna miss me?
"
,,
3,10," Only until I go and buy a Hustler.
"
,,
3,10,"I left you the number for the spa.
"
,,
3,10,"See you in a few days.
"
,,
3,10,"Not if I strangle myself
"
,,
3,10,"with a seaweed wrap and die.
"
,,
3,10,"You are dark!
"
,,
3,10,"You haven't told me
"
,,
3,10,"how you expect to pay for that boat.
"
,,
3,10,"There's got to be a hundred banks
"
,,
3,10,"that'll give me a loan.
"
,,
3,10," So, you can really give me a loan?
"
,,
3,10," I sure can.
"
,,
3,10,"What sets us apart from other banks
"
,,
3,10,"is that other banks are banks.
"
,,
3,10," Now, I trust you have collateral.
"
,,
3,10," I got three kids.
"
,,
3,10,"I'll take 'em. Just kidding.
"
,,
3,10,"Or maybe I'm not. Sign this.
"
,,
3,10,"Here you go. Good luck!
"
,,
3,10," What do you want on your thigh?
"
,,
3,10," I want a skull.
"
,,
3,10,"OK. I can draw Kermit the Frog.
"
,,
3,10,"How about a nice Kermit the Frog?
"
,,
3,10," No. I want a skull.
"
,,
3,10," OK. I'll go ahead and do Kermit the Frog.
"
,,
3,10," Mom, this is so lame.
"
,,
3,10," Come on, Meg. Try to have fun.
"
,,
3,10,"I promise after a few days you won't
"
,,
3,10,"remember the words ""spring break"".
"
,,
3,10,"Hey, how about some TV?
"
,,
3,10,"This is MTV
"
,,
3,10,"and we're rocking at spring break!
"
,,
3,10,"Hey, this is VH1
"
,,
3,10,"and we're rocking at spring break.
"
,,
3,10,"...leaving thousands injured.
"
,,
3,10,"For CNN, I'm Bernard Shaw,
"
,,
3,10,"keeping it real and kicking ass
"
,,
3,10,"at spring break! Whoo!
"
,,
3,10,"Here she is, boys. The S.S. More Powerful
"
,,
3,10,"than Superman, Batman, Spiderman
"
,,
3,10,"and the Incredible Hulk Put Together.
"
,,
3,10,"She's a fine vessel.
"
,,
3,10,"Welcome to the wharf. Name's Hennessey.
"
,,
3,10,"Peter Griffin.
"
,,
3,10,"Friends call me Peter for short.
"
,,
3,10,"I'll let you in on a secret, neighbour. The
"
,,
3,10,"best fishing is at latitude 42, longitude 71.
"
,,
3,10," Keep that to yourself.
"
,,
3,10," Wow, thanks.
"
,,
3,10,"I'll see you, fellas. I got some fish to catch.
"
,,
3,10,"Let's see, latitude 42, longitude 71.
"
,,
3,10,"This is it. What the hell...?
"
,,
3,10,"Papa, he killed Mordecai,
"
,,
3,10,"the Dancing Yiddish Clown!
"
,,
3,10,"Stop crying.
"
,,
3,10,"You just became a man. Act like one.
"
,,
3,10,"What's the big idea sending me
"
,,
3,10,"to that bar mitzvah?
"
,,
3,10,"Cos I don't like you! We don't need any
"
,,
3,10,"more fishermen crowding up this wharf!
"
,,
3,10," Fine. You want an enemy, you got one!
"
,,
3,10," Fine!
"
,,
3,10,"There we are.
"
,,
3,10,"Steve, you ever think
"
,,
3,10,"of growing a moustache?
"
,,
3,10,"Nice fish you got there, Griffin.
"
,,
3,10,"What are you selling? Your bait?
"
,,
3,10,"Nice face, Hennessey.
"
,,
3,10,"Yes! Me, one. You, zero.
"
,,
3,10,"Hey!
"
,,
3,10," Wow. So, how do you do it?
"
,,
3,10," Oh, you're very nice to ask.
"
,,
3,10,"First, I hang the old worm out there.
"
,,
3,10,"They usually go for it.
"
,,
3,10,"I jerk 'em around. They fight for a while.
"
,,
3,10,"Then they lay back and accept it.
"
,,
3,10," How about we get together later?
"
,,
3,10," OK.
"
,,
3,10,"What the hell...? Oh, dammit!
"
,,
3,10,"Hey, what's going on here?
"
,,
3,10,"Did you read the fine print
"
,,
3,10,"on this loan contract?
"
,,
3,10,"If by read, you mean
"
,,
3,10,"imagined a naked lady, then yes.
"
,,
3,10,"The bank's taking all our stuff.
"
,,
3,10,"And if you don't pay them within 48 hours,
"
,,
3,10,"they get the house, too.
"
,,
3,10,"Oh, boy! I get to go live at the bank!
"
,,
3,10,"Did I ever tell you if you're on birth control
"
,,
3,10,"and you take an antibiotic,
"
,,
3,10,"it makes it not work?
"
,,
3,10,"Because no one told me.
"
,,
3,10,"I thought you should know.
"
,,
3,10,"I don't really feel like talking right now.
"
,,
3,10,"Fine. I just don't understand why we had
"
,,
3,10,"to leave the spa so early.
"
,,
3,10,"I wanna go home and spend the next three
"
,,
3,10,"days in solitary confinement where I belong!
"
,,
3,10,"Well, I tried.
"
,,
3,10," What the hell are we doing here?
"
,,
3,10," This is where you wanted to be, right?
"
,,
3,10,"Yeah. But not with you!
"
,,
3,10,"Did you hear what happened
"
,,
3,10,"to that dude from UMass?
"
,,
3,10,"He got so drunk he fell off
"
,,
3,10,"his hotel balcony! He's in a coma!
"
,,
3,10," Oh, man! I want to party with him!
"
,,
3,10," You know it! Yeah!
"
,,
3,10," Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
"
,,
3,10," Yeah! Yeah!
"
,,
3,10," Hey, look. Meg made it, you guys.
"
,,
3,10," Yeah. And she brought her mommy.
"
,,
3,10," Oh, my God.
"
,,
3,10," Come on, Meg! Get out of the car!
"
,,
3,10,"Like the kids say,
"
,,
3,10,"up your nose with a rubber hose!
"
,,
3,10,"Whoo!
"
,,
3,10,"Hey, look, everybody. It's Spuds MacKenzie!
"
,,
3,10,"Aaargh!
"
,,
3,10," Well, that's the last of the furniture.
"
,,
3,10," No TV. I miss my friends.
"
,,
3,10,"John Ritter, Florence Henderson,
"
,,
3,10,"Alfonso Ribeiro.
"
,,
3,10," Is he the guy from Silver Spoons?
"
,,
3,10," No. He was on French Prince of Bel-Air.
"
,,
3,10," Fresh Prince.
"
,,
3,10," Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. I don't know if...
"
,,
3,10," Hey, Alfonso.
"
,,
3,10," Yeah?
"
,,
3,10," Were you on Silver Spoons?
"
,,
3,10," Yes.
"
,,
3,10,"There you go.
"
,,
3,10," Come on. Just a little higher, honey.
"
,,
3,10," Mom, I don't think I can...
"
,,
3,10," Who's holding Lois?
"
,,
3,10," I don't know. Some dude named Mel.
"
,,
3,10,"This is Carson Daly. We're live here
"
,,
3,10,"at spring break. Who wants to party?!
"
,,
3,10,"OK, one, two, three, four, five...
"
,,
3,10,"We'll need cake and juice for 14 people.
"
,,
3,10,"Now let's go to Tom Green, who's
"
,,
3,10,"gonna do something really outrageous!
"
,,
3,10,"Does anyone out there like me yet?
"
,,
3,10,"Can I stop this?
"
,,
3,10,"What the hell are you doing in my house?
"
,,
3,10,"Your house? This is my house.
"
,,
3,10,"My wife and I bought it from the bank.
"
,,
3,10,"I still got another day to pay back the loan.
"
,,
3,10,"The bank said you're a fat deadbeat loser.
"
,,
3,10,"Fat deadbeat loser?
"
,,
3,10,"While I may not agree with what you say,
"
,,
3,10,"I'll defend to the death your right to say it.
"
,,
3,10,"There we are. It's a Van Gogh print.
"
,,
3,10,"Isn't it beautiful?
"
,,
3,10,"I've fantasised about what this house
"
,,
3,10,"would be like with culture.
"
,,
3,10," The port is good.
"
,,
3,10," Yes.
"
,,
3,10," Indeed.
"
,,
3,10," Most certainly.
"
,,
3,10," What year is it?
"
,,
3,10," '51.
"
,,
3,10," Ahh.
"
,,
3,10," Delectable.
"
,,
3,10," Indeed.
"
,,
3,10," Yes.
"
,,
3,10," Oh, dear!
"
,,
3,10," What is it?
"
,,
3,10," I've spontaneously combusted.
"
,,
3,10," I am sorry.
"
,,
3,10,"I've grown tired of living.
"
,,
3,10," Very good.
"
,,
3,10," For the best.
"
,,
3,10," Yes, indeed.
"
,,
3,10," Is it raining again?
"
,,
3,10,"Hey, did you hear the one about us?
"
,,
3,10," Wow. You are such a good dancer.
"
,,
3,10," Way to go on that beer bong.
"
,,
3,10," Yeah, no fake. No fake.
"
,,
3,10," Mom!
"
,,
3,10," Hey! What are you doing here?
"
,,
3,10," What am I doing here?
"
,,
3,10," I've been waiting out here for hours!
"
,,
3,10," What?
"
,,
3,10,"You were gonna pop inside real quick
"
,,
3,10,"and find someone who looked like me
"
,,
3,10,"so I could use their ID,
"
,,
3,10,"then you were supposed to come out
"
,,
3,10,"and give me the ID so I can get inside!
"
,,
3,10," What?
"
,,
3,10," God, it's like talking to a three-year-old!
"
,,
3,10,"You need to learn how
"
,,
3,10,"to loosen up a little, toots.
"
,,
3,10," You're loose enough for the both of us.
"
,,
3,10," What?
"
,,
3,10," Nothing.
"
,,
3,10," That's right, nothing. Don't you sass me!
"
,,
3,10,"Good evening. Stevenson residence.
"
,,
3,10,"Chris, we've been over this a thousand times.
"
,,
3,10,"It's pronounced ""Griffin"".
"
,,
3,10," Hi, Mom!
"
,,
3,10," Hi, Chris. Put your father on.
"
,,
3,10," Hey, Dad?
"
,,
3,10," French guy says ""Deodorant? What's that?""
"
,,
3,10,"All right. All right.
"
,,
3,10,"I've got one. I've got one. OK.
"
,,
3,10,"Two men are standing at the Pearly Gates.
"
,,
3,10,"Oh, God, wait. How did that one go?
"
,,
3,10,"It turns out they're Siegfried and Roy.
"
,,
3,10,"I'm no good at telling jokes.
"
,,
3,10," Dad, it's Mom.
"
,,
3,10," Oh, God. Please be Somerset Maugham.
"
,,
3,10," Hello?
"
,,
3,10," Peter?
"
,,
3,10," Damn!
"
,,
3,10," Calling to check in, see how you guys are.
"
,,
3,10,"Oh, we're fine.
"
,,
3,10," What's all that noise?
"
,,
3,10," Nothing. Nothing.
"
,,
3,10," I need you to take out the trash.
"
,,
3,10," OK, Lois! Lois, I got to go.
"
,,
3,10,"Holy crap, Brian! What am I gonna do?
"
,,
3,10,"Lois will be home in a coupla days
"
,,
3,10,"and we're getting kicked out tomorrow.
"
,,
3,10," What do you suggest?
"
,,
3,10," Get out your ring.
"
,,
3,10," That's not gonna...
"
,,
3,10," Come on!
"
,,
3,10,"Wonder Twin powers, activate!
"
,,
3,10,"Form of... steam!
"
,,
3,10,"We got these in a box of Frankenberry.
"
,,
3,10,"A jackal! Jackal! It's a jackal! It looks
"
,,
3,10,"like a jackal! Jackal? It's a jackal! Jackal?
"
,,
3,10," Time!
"
,,
3,10," It wasn't right the first time!
"
,,
3,10,"Why the hell would it be right
"
,,
3,10,"the next ten times?! God!
"
,,
3,10,"I am screwed. I'm gonna lose my house
"
,,
3,10,"and my boat and everything.
"
,,
3,10,"How am I gonna come up with 50 grand?
"
,,
3,10,"You could whore yourself out to
"
,,
3,10,"a thousand fat chicks for 50 bucks apiece.
"
,,
3,10,"Or 50 really fat chicks
"
,,
3,10,"for a thousand bucks.
"
,,
3,10,"What? Don't look at me like that. Fat chicks
"
,,
3,10,"need love, too. But they got to pay.
"
,,
3,10,"Agh! What is this?
"
,,
3,10,"Sea water, courtesy
"
,,
3,10,"of that gentleman over there.
"
,,
3,10,"You need 50 grand, Griffin?
"
,,
3,10,"I got a suggestion for you.
"
,,
3,10,"Why don't you kill Daggermouth?
"
,,
3,10,"Maybe I will, Hennessey.
"
,,
3,10,"You'd be buying yourself
"
,,
3,10,"a one-way ticket to a watery grave.
"
,,
3,10,"Daggermouth is the meanest, most ruthless
"
,,
3,10,"creature that's ever inhabited the sea.
"
,,
3,10,"Legend has it he dwells out
"
,,
3,10,"by Fish Stench Cove.
"
,,
3,10,"He'll kill any man that comes near there.
"
,,
3,10,"I saw him once.
"
,,
3,10,"Sure, I'm blind in one eye, and my other eye
"
,,
3,10,"was infected that day from picking at it,
"
,,
3,10,"and I was tired, and I'd been swimming
"
,,
3,10,"in a pool with too much chlorine,
"
,,
3,10,"and my glasses were at LensCrafters,
"
,,
3,10,"but I seen that fish!
"
,,
3,10,"If there's 50 grand in it,
"
,,
3,10,"I don't think I got a choice.
"
,,
3,10,"You can whore yourself out
"
,,
3,10,"to a thousand fat chicks for 50 bucks.
"
,,
3,10," No, we covered that.
"
,,
3,10," You ain't got a chance.
"
,,
3,10,"Daggermouth killed my friend Salty,
"
,,
3,10,"and he was twice the fisherman you are.
"
,,
3,10,"And half the weight! Ooh...
"
,,
3,10,"Hey, no! No! Hot!
"
,,
3,10,"Lt'd be suicide to go after that fish.
"
,,
3,10,"There's got to be another way.
"
,,
3,10," We could have a bake sale.
"
,,
3,10," I think that's a neat idea.
"
,,
3,10,"No! I am not gonna let my family
"
,,
3,10,"live on the street.
"
,,
3,10,"Not even if it means ending up like Shamus.
"
,,
3,10,"Now, if you'll excuse me,
"
,,
3,10,"I have a date with destiny.
"
,,
3,10," So were you, like, in an accident or what?
"
,,
3,10," No. Me father was a tree.
"
,,
3,10,"What's wrong with me?
"
,,
3,10,"I gotta be crazy to think I can kill that
"
,,
3,10,"man-eating fish. What the hell am I doing?
"
,,
3,10,"Hey, hey, hey. Come on, Peter.
"
,,
3,10,"What kind of talk is that?
"
,,
3,10,"Yeah, you can do it.
"
,,
3,10,"Who's my big brave boy, huh?
"
,,
3,10," Me.
"
,,
3,10," Who's my big brave boy?
"
,,
3,10,"Me.

,,
3,10," This sucks, Mom.
"
,,
3,10," Meg, stop moping.
"
,,
3,10,"These are the best years of your life.
"
,,
3,10,"Let's get up there and live a little.
"
,,
3,10," I look like an idiot!
"
,,
3,10," No, you don't. Come on.
"
,,
3,10,"Just move your hips a little like this.
"
,,
3,10," Lois! Lois! Lois!
"
,,
3,10," Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg!
"
,,
3,10,"Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg!
"
,,
3,10,"Attagirl! Shake your moneymaker!
"
,,
3,10,"Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg!
"
,,
3,10,"Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg!
"
,,
3,10,"Oh, my God! It's a chick!
"
,,
3,10," Ay, Dios mio, una chica!
"
,,
3,10," All right, everybody! This party's over!
"
,,
3,10,"Why do you cops
"
,,
3,10,"always have to kill our buzz?
"
,,
3,10,"He used a teenage colloquialism.
"
,,
3,10,"Get the tear gas.
"
,,
3,10," Not so fast, big guy.
"
,,
3,10," What are you guys doing here?
"
,,
3,10,"We're gonna help you kill the fish.
"
,,
3,10," This will be dangerous. We could all die.
"
,,
3,10," Come on. You're our best friend.
"
,,
3,10,"I can remember when you saved all our butts.
"
,,
3,10,"Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh.
"
,,
3,10,"Hyah!
"
,,
3,10,"Too bad I didn't get there till after
"
,,
3,10,"the sodomy. Let's go kick some fish ass!
"
,,
3,10,"I can't believe
"
,,
3,10,"I just showed everyone my tater tots.
"
,,
3,10,"Worst of all,
"
,,
3,10,"now I'm gonna have a police record.
"
,,
3,10,"If you're gonna grab ahold of life,
"
,,
3,10,"you've gotta expect to get
"
,,
3,10,"your hands dirty once in a while.
"
,,
3,10," It was cool that people noticed me.
"
,,
3,10," That's the spirit.
"
,,
3,10,"OK, one, two, three... tuck and roll!
"
,,
3,10,"We're right on course. Give me another beer.
"
,,
3,10,"These are the precious moments.
"
,,
3,10,"The four of us out at sea, miles away
"
,,
3,10,"from civilisation, tossing back brews.
"
,,
3,10,"Amen to that. You guys, here's one for you.
"
,,
3,10,"Let's say none of us were married.
"
,,
3,10,"If you could have any woman,
"
,,
3,10,"who would it be?
"
,,
3,10," Mariel Hemingway.
"
,,
3,10," Really?
"
,,
3,10," That's not a good choice.
"
,,
3,10," She's so jagged.
"
,,
3,10,"I think she's very attractive
"
,,
3,10,"in a classical kind of way.
"
,,
3,10,"But you could cut a roast on her face.
"
,,
3,10," I would go with Margaret Thatcher.
"
,,
3,10," Why the hell Margaret Thatcher?
"
,,
3,10,"Oh, so nobody here thinks power is sexy?
"
,,
3,10," Not one of you finds power sexy?
"
,,
3,10," How about you, Peter?
"
,,
3,10,"The chick with the three knockers
"
,,
3,10,"from Total Recall.
"
,,
3,10," I never saw that movie.
"
,,
3,10," One of them was papier-mch.
"
,,
3,10,"Can I change my answer...?
"
,,
3,10,"Of course I know it's paper! I don't care!
"
,,
3,10,"What's wrong with you?
"
,,
3,10,"What about you, Quagmire?
"
,,
3,10," Taylor Hanson.
"
,,
3,10," Taylor Hanson's a guy.
"
,,
3,10,"You guys are yanking me.
"
,,
3,10,"""Let's put one over on old Quagmire. ""
"
,,
3,10,"No, he's actually a guy, Quagmire.
"
,,
3,10,"Wha... Well, this is insane!
"
,,
3,10,"That's impossible!
"
,,
3,10,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,10,"Oh, my God, I can't... Oh, God!
"
,,
3,10,"I got all these magazines!
"
,,
3,10,"Oh, God! Oh, God!
"
,,
3,10," This must be Fish Stench Cove.
"
,,
3,10," Now all we gotta do is find the fish.
"
,,
3,10,"I wonder where that fish did go.
"
,,
3,10,"A fish, a fish, a fishy-o!
"
,,
3,10,"I heard that when Daggermouth eats you,
"
,,
3,10,"he devours your guts first.
"
,,
3,10,"I heard he doesn't just eat you,
"
,,
3,10,"he eats your soul.
"
,,
3,10,"I heard that one of Shannon Doherty's eyes
"
,,
3,10,"is off-centre cos it's trying to escape.
"
,,
3,10,"Welcome, gentlemen.
"
,,
3,10," Agh!
"
,,
3,10," It's him! Quick, shoot him!
"
,,
3,10,"Not so fast! Perhaps I could
"
,,
3,10,"offer you a glass of port.
"
,,
3,10,"And you, a glass of starboard.
"
,,
3,10,"That's a nautical joke.
"
,,
3,10," I'm a fish. I'm also delightfully mad.
"
,,
3,10," Agh!
"
,,
3,10,"Would you mind holding still for a moment?
"
,,
3,10,"These antique pistols
"
,,
3,10,"take ten minutes to reload.
"
,,
3,10," Peter, catch!
"
,,
3,10," Ow! Don't throw stuff at me, Joe!
"
,,
3,10," Shoot him!
"
,,
3,10," Oh, yeah. Right.
"
,,
3,10,"My God. Isn't it amazing that that's
"
,,
3,10,"what we all look like on the inside?
"
,,
3,10," It's a robot, you idiot.
"
,,
3,10," Who are you?
"
,,
3,10," I'm Salty.
"
,,
3,10," Everybody said you were killed by the fish.
"
,,
3,10,"That's what I wanted. I disappeared
"
,,
3,10,"and spread the Daggermouth rumour myself.
"
,,
3,10," Why?
"
,,
3,10," Merchandise. T-shirts, mugs, posters.
"
,,
3,10,"I'm in talks with Nickelodeon
"
,,
3,10,"for a cartoon show.
"
,,
3,10," I'd pair him with an effeminate cat.
"
,,
3,10," I'd watch that.
"
,,
3,10," Me too.
"
,,
3,10," Sounds like a good balance.
"
,,
3,10,"And now I'm gonna give you
"
,,
3,10,"$50,000 to be on your way.
"
,,
3,10," $50,000? For what?
"
,,
3,10," To keep your mouth shut.
"
,,
3,10,"The longer we stay here,
"
,,
3,10,"the more people will question
"
,,
3,10,"how a fisherman
"
,,
3,10,"with no engineering background
"
,,
3,10,"built a sophisticated talking fish robot.
"
,,
3,10,"You know, honey,
"
,,
3,10,"I'm really sorry for how I acted.
"
,,
3,10,"Getting drunk and ditching you at the bar,
"
,,
3,10,"and letting those boys take pictures
"
,,
3,10,"of you sleeping.
"
,,
3,10,"I was so busy having fun,
"
,,
3,10,"I guess I kind of ruined it for you.
"
,,
3,10,"Uh-oh. We got company.
"
,,
3,10," Looks like your friends are back, Mom.
"
,,
3,10," Meg! Meg! Meg! Meg!
"
,,
3,10,"No, I think this one's all yours.
"
,,
3,10," Whoo! Yeah! You go, girl!
"
,,
3,10," One's an innie and one's an outie.
"
,,
3,10,"And now, back to ""Daggermouth
"
,,
3,10,"and Boom Boom"" on Nickelodeon.
"
,,
3,10,"Boom Boom, did you do
"
,,
3,10,"your exercises today?
"
,,
3,10,"Yes. I did 20 laps.
"
,,
3,10,"And I'm about to do 20 more.
"
,,
3,10," Oh, you!
"
,,
3,10," Yipes!
"
,,
3,10,"Peter, I'm so glad being a fisherman
"
,,
3,10,"is working out for you.
"
,,
3,10,"I got to admit I half expected to come home,
"
,,
3,10,"and our stuff would be gone,
"
,,
3,10,"and we'd owe somebody a lot of money.
"
,,
3,10," How can you half expect something?
"
,,
3,10," It's just a turn of phrase.
"
,,
3,10," How do you turn a phrase?
"
,,
3,10," God, you're dumb. Thank God for that ass.
"
,,
3,10,"Now, come here and kiss me.
"
,,
3,10," Good night, honey.
"
,,
3,10," Good night, Lois.
"

3,10," Good night, Jim and Abby.

"
,,
3,11," Glen, we have a family emergency.
"
,,
3,11,"We really need you to take the kids
"
,,
3,11,"for just a couple of days.
"
,,
3,11,"In accordance with Megan's Law,
"
,,
3,11,"I'm obligated to inform you that...
"
,,
3,11," That's fine. I'll take the kids.
"
,,
3,11," Thanks, buddy.
"
,,
3,11,"Gosh, I never entertained kids before.
"

3,11,"So a chick walks into

3,11,"Diggly, diggly, diggly, diggly!
"

3,11,"Carol, we'll get you through this.
"
,,
3,11,"In a few days you'll have a beautiful baby
"
,,
3,11,"to smother with all your unrequited love.
"
,,
3,11,"And as soon as the baby can crawl,
"
,,
3,11,"it'll probably leave me too,
"
,,
3,11,"just like my eight husbands.
"
,,
3,11,"Hey, Carol. It's me, Ted.
"
,,
3,11,"I came back because I love you and...
"
,,
3,11,"I'm just kidding. It's me, Peter.
"
,,
3,11,"It was so nice of you to come, Peter.
"
,,
3,11,"You're so considerate.
"
,,
3,11,"It was nothing.
"
,,
3,11,"Mr Quagmire, I finished the scavenger hunt.
"
,,
3,11,"Hold your horses. Let's go down the list.
"
,,
3,11," An unsharpened pencil?
"
,,
3,11," Check.
"
,,
3,11,"A speed-limit sign that
"
,,
3,11,"doesn't end in five or zero?
"
,,
3,11,"Your mom's hairbrush?
"
,,
3,11," You win!
"
,,
3,11," Oh, boy! What's my prize?
"
,,
3,11," A pencil and a speed sign.
"
,,
3,11," I did it!
"
,,
3,11,"I'll be right back.
"
,,
3,11,"Teeth and some toenail clippings
"
,,
3,11,"and we'll be ready for our date.
"
,,
3,11,"Carol, since Ted dumped you,
"
,,
3,11,"can I have his shirts?
"
,,
3,11,"Ted's shirts? He's half your size.
"
,,
3,11,"I know, but check this out.
"
,,
3,11,"Carol, say ""David Banner,
"
,,
3,11,"I just slashed your tyres. ""
"
,,
3,11," David Banner, I just slashed your tyres.
"
,,
3,11," Aaagh!
"
,,
3,11,"I'm priceless!
"
,,
3,11,"Sit with Carol. I'm gonna use the ladies room.
"
,,
3,11," Does she still take the newspaper in there?
"
,,
3,11," Yeah.
"
,,
3,11,"And after she does, I just can't read it.
"
,,
3,11,"Oh! Oh, God! The baby's gonna be here
"
,,
3,11,"any minute. We'd better get moving.
"
,,
3,11,"You gotta relax. You let that kid start
"
,,
3,11,"calling the shots now and you're screwed.
"
,,
3,11,"Is Mr Quagmire baby-sitting
"
,,
3,11,"all these people, too?
"
,,
3,11,"Hey. If I could rearrange the alphabet,
"
,,
3,11,"I'd put U and I together.
"
,,
3,11,"You must be a parking ticket,
"
,,
3,11,"cos you got ""fine"" written all over you.
"
,,
3,11,"Hey, there. I don't wanna
"
,,
3,11,"come between you... or do I?
"
,,
3,11,"That's awful.
"
,,
3,11,"This is a song I've been singing
"
,,
3,11,"for a number of years,
"
,,
3,11,"and I find it grows truer and truer
"
,,
3,11,"as time goes by.
"
,,
3,11,"I'm hungry for you, baby.
"
,,
3,11,"Come on, walk with me, talk with me.
"
,,
3,11,"Don't worry. We're almost there.
"
,,
3,11,"Peter, why are we stopped?
"
,,
3,11," I'll have three cheeseburgers.
"
,,
3,11," For God's sake, she's having a baby!
"
,,
3,11,"Oh, that's right. And a kid's meal.
"
,,
3,11,"And... I guess I'll have fries.
"
,,
3,11,"If I have fries,
"
,,
3,11,"is anybody else gonna have any?
"
,,
3,11,"I don't wanna be the only one eating 'em.
"
,,
3,11,"I'll feel like a fatty.
"
,,
3,11," Nurse, this woman is in labour.
"
,,
3,11," Excuse me. I was here first.
"
,,
3,11,"My leg is asleep.
"
,,
3,11,"Oh!
"
,,
3,11,"All right, let's see what we have here.
"
,,
3,11,"The baby's crowning.
"
,,
3,11,"Oh!
"
,,
3,11,"All right, I'm just going to put on
"
,,
3,11,"a pair of gloves and we'll deliver this baby.
"
,,
3,11,"These don't feel like gloves at all.
"
,,
3,11,"They feel like used needles.
"
,,
3,11,"But this is where I always keep the gloves.
"
,,
3,11,"Maybe if I dig deeper.
"
,,
3,11,"No, just feels like more needles.
"
,,
3,11,"That's the craziest thing.
"
,,
3,11,"Oh. Now I'm sure this isn't the glove drawer.
"
,,
3,11,"Oh, my God! Who's gonna deliver my baby?
"
,,
3,11,"Honey, do something!
"
,,
3,11,"No baby, but it looks like
"
,,
3,11,"Carol's blowing a bubble.
"
,,
3,11," Peter, that's the head. Push! Push!
"
,,
3,11," I am! It won't go back in.
"
,,
3,11,"Not you, Peter. Carol, push. Peter, you pull.
"
,,
3,11,"Aagh!
"
,,
3,11," Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,11," What? What?
"
,,
3,11,"It's a beautiful baby girl.
"
,,
3,11,"A baby girl. I'm so happy!
"
,,
3,11,"But she has a penis.
"
,,
3,11,"We'll have to do something about that.
"
,,
3,11," Peter, no! It's a boy.
"
,,
3,11," Well, how do you like that!
"
,,
3,11,"Hey there, little fella.
"
,,
3,11,"Welcome to the planet Earth!
"
,,
3,11,"Coochie, coochie, coochie-coo!
"
,,
3,11," He takes after his Uncle Peter.
"
,,
3,11," He's Carol's baby. Give him to her.
"
,,
3,11,"Oh, yeah.
"
,,
3,11,"Honey, you were fantastic. And you were
"
,,
3,11,"so cute when you were holding it.
"
,,
3,11,"I know. I didn't wanna give it up. Let's steal it.
"
,,
3,11,"No, wait. I got a better idea.
"
,,
3,11," Lois, let's have another baby.
"
,,
3,11," What?
"
,,
3,11," Sweetie, you're not serious?
"
,,
3,11," I sure am.
"
,,
3,11,"The best thing I've ever done is being a dad.
"
,,
3,11,"Peter, I think it's a wonderful idea.
"
,,
3,11,"Why haven't you sent for help?
"
,,
3,11,"I can't believe you wanna have another kid.
"
,,
3,11,"Did you find Chris and Meg's baby books?
"
,,
3,11,"Not yet. Hey, look at this, Lois.
"
,,
3,11,"It's our pet rock.
"
,,
3,11,"I remember the first day we brought it home.
"
,,
3,11,"See that? Huh? Huh?
"
,,
3,11,"Bad rock! Bad!
"
,,
3,11,"We do that outside.
"
,,
3,11,"Look at him. He knows what he did.
"
,,
3,11,"I found my baby book!
"
,,
3,11,"Hey, here's the broken condom
"
,,
3,11,"that led to my birth.
"
,,
3,11,"And the resulting lawsuit bought us
"
,,
3,11,"this house. You're my favourite mistake.
"
,,
3,11,"You see, Meg? I'm the favourite.
"
,,
3,11,"Ah, baby books. Nostalgic for the days
"
,,
3,11,"of chafed nipples and episiotomies?
"
,,
3,11," Somebody hasn't heard the news.
"
,,
3,11," News? What news?
"
,,
3,11,"What's the most wonderful thing
"
,,
3,11,"that could happen to this family?
"
,,
3,11,"The Phillies won.
"
,,
3,11," You're gonna have a baby brother.
"
,,
3,11," Or a sister.
"
,,
3,11,"A new baby. That's wonderful.

,,
3,11,"Call me when Kojak starts.

3,11,"What?!
"
,,
3,11,"Another baby? But I'm the baby. Why
"
,,
3,11,"the deuce would they want to replace me?
"
,,
3,11,"My cheeks are pinchable, my bottom
"
,,
3,11,"is smooth, my laugh is heart-warming.
"
,,
3,11,"What's that? I certainly am not overreacting.
"
,,
3,11,"What happened to Bobby
"
,,
3,11,"when they added Oliver to The Brady Bunch?
"
,,
3,11," Oliver, did you break this vase?
"
,,
3,11," No, the floor did.
"
,,
3,11,"He's so cute.
"
,,
3,11," Hey, everybody! I...
"
,,
3,11," Bobby, you get back in the garage!
"
,,
3,11,"It can't happen. I was here first. Well,
"
,,
3,11,"technically third, but no time for semantics.
"
,,
3,11,"This is Stewie country,
"
,,
3,11,"and I intend to keep it that way.
"
,,
3,11,"As God is my witness, from this day forward,
"
,,
3,11,"Peter and Lois shall not conceive.
"
,,
3,11," What are you doing here?
"
,,
3,11," Peter and Lois are... getting intimate.
"
,,
3,11,"My God, I thought I had more time.
"
,,
3,11,"I've got to stop them.
"
,,
3,11,"Whaaa! Whaaa!
"
,,
3,11,"Mommy, Daddy, I had a bad dream!
"
,,
3,11,"I saw the bo...
"
,,
3,11,"Blast! What is that name again?
"
,,
3,11,"Bo... Bo... Bogeyman! Yes, that's it!
"
,,
3,11," I saw the bogeyman.
"
,,
3,11," Did someone have a bad dream?
"
,,
3,11,"Why don't you sleep
"
,,
3,11,"with Mommy and Daddy?
"
,,
3,11,"Peter, for God's sake. Stewie's right here.
"
,,
3,11,"We can still do it.
"
,,
3,11,"He'll just think I'm hurtin' ya.
"
,,
3,11,"Relax, honey. It's only for tonight.
"
,,
3,11,"Roll over. Roll over, I say!
"
,,
3,11,"Smells like cheese.
"
,,
3,11," OK, insert rod support A into slot B.
"
,,
3,11," That's what...
"
,,
3,11,"If you say ""That's what she said""
"
,,
3,11,"once more, I'll pop you.
"
,,
3,11,"What you buildin', neighbour?
"
,,
3,11,"We were keeping it a secret,
"
,,
3,11,"but you're my best friends, so I'll tell ya.
"
,,
3,11,"Lois and I are having another baby!
"
,,
3,11,"We are so throwing you a shower.
"
,,
3,11,"Fat man, we'll see if Lois
"
,,
3,11,"wants to have sexual relations
"
,,
3,11,"when she finds lipstick on your collar.
"
,,
3,11,"There we are.
"
,,
3,11,"Well, look at you there.
"
,,
3,11,"You're a filthy girl, aren't you?
"
,,
3,11,"Yes, you're looking for a bad time,
"
,,
3,11,"that's what you're after.
"
,,
3,11,"You're a dirty flirt. You want it bad
"
,,
3,11,"and you don't care who you get it from,
"
,,
3,11,"because you have no self-respect,
"
,,
3,11,"and that gets you off, doesn't it?
"
,,
3,11,"Stewie! Bad boy! That's Mommy's make-up.
"
,,
3,11,"And you got it all over your father's
"
,,
3,11,"favourite shirt. Go to your room.
"
,,
3,11,"Wow. The evidence is really piling up.
"
,,
3,11,"Make any joke you want.
"
,,
3,11,"You know I look good.
"
,,
3,11,"Oh, my God! They're at it again. All this time
"
,,
3,11,"spent keeping people from having sex!
"
,,
3,11,"Now I know how
"
,,
3,11,"the Catholic Church feels. Ba-zing!
"
,,
3,11,"Time to initiate phase two.
"
,,
3,11,"All right, testing voice modulator.
"
,,
3,11,"Blast, you vile woman!
"
,,
3,11," Blast, you vile woman.
"
,,
3,11," That won't do.
"
,,
3,11,"Pardon me, you with
"
,,
3,11,"severe aesthetic deficiencies.
"
,,
3,11," Hey, ugly!
"
,,
3,11," Excellent. Ha-ha-ha-ha!
"
,,
3,11,"Sweet. Ha-ha-ha-ha!
"
,,
3,11,"Who's got beer?
"
,,
3,11," Where'd you go, my little pumpkin-eater?
"
,,
3,11," To the can. Kissing you made me barf.
"
,,
3,11," What?
"
,,
3,11," Dad, Meg keeps pushing me.
"
,,
3,11," Like I could! He's so fat.
"
,,
3,11," I'm not fat. I'm Rubenesque.
"
,,
3,11,"That's it. Your dad's had enough.
"
,,
3,11,"I want you kids to go and drink
"
,,
3,11,"the antifreeze in the garage.
"
,,
3,11,"I'm gonna chug it all
"
,,
3,11,"so there's none left for you.
"
,,
3,11," Watch it!
"
,,
3,11," Peter!
"
,,
3,11,"What?
"
,,
3,11,"Hey, Peter.
"
,,
3,11,"I see nussing. Nussing.
"
,,
3,11,"I've had it with these interruptions.
"
,,
3,11,"All we want is time alone.
"
,,
3,11,"You kids go to your rooms
"
,,
3,11,"for the rest of the night.
"
,,
3,11,"I don't wanna go to my room.
"
,,
3,11,"There's an evil monkey in my closet.
"
,,
3,11,"Evil monkey! That's funny.
"
,,
3,11,"Agh!
"
,,
3,11,"This romantic dinner
"
,,
3,11,"was a wonderful idea, Peter.
"
,,
3,11,"You deserve it, my beautiful princess.
"
,,
3,11,"You know, I'm not wearing any panties.
"
,,
3,11,"Don't worry.
"
,,
3,11,"We can always throw that chair out.
"
,,
3,11,"Very well, then. If I can't stop them from
"
,,
3,11,"the outside, I'll stop them from the inside.
"
,,
3,11,"Oh, dear. I'm afraid you're in a no-fly zone.
"
,,
3,11,"As was your fate, Mr Fly, so is the fate
"
,,
3,11,"of every sperm in Peter's body.
"
,,
3,11,"Aagh!

"

3,11," Well, it seems you're out of ammunition.
"

3,11," As are you, Stewart.
"
,,
3,11," You know my name.
"
,,
3,11," I know many things.
"
,,
3,11," Indeed.
"
,,
3,11," Quite.
"

3,11,"We should exchange monosyllabic
"

3,11,"expressions of arrogance in person.
"

3,11," Hm.
"

3,11," Mm.
"

3,11," Peter, I'm waiting.
"
,,
3,11," I'm comin'.
"
,,
3,11," You came unarmed?
"
,,
3,11," As we agreed.
"
,,
3,11,"Admirable. But foolish!
"
,,
3,11,"It's going to be a shame
"
,,
3,11,"to destroy such a worthy adversary.
"
,,
3,11,"My thoughts exactly.
"
,,
3,11," I've got you in the sleeper hold.
"
,,
3,11," As I you.
"
,,
3,11,"Your attempts to escape are...
"
,,
3,11,"Futile.
"
,,
3,11,"Well, well. Nap time appears to be over.
"
,,
3,11,"Finish me off. My one regret is that I won't be
"
,,
3,11,"able to do away with that red-headed woman.
"
,,
3,11,"What the...? How the devil
"
,,
3,11,"do you know about Lois?
"
,,
3,11,"You've seen that little gleam
"
,,
3,11,"in the fat man's eye? That twinkle?
"
,,
3,11,"That's me, plotting my escape.
"
,,
3,11,"You hate Lois? I hate Lois, too.
"
,,
3,11,"What else do you hate?
"
,,
3,11,"People who send pictures
"
,,
3,11,"of their families as Christmas cards.
"
,,
3,11," People who use the word ""guestimate"".
"
,,
3,11," Guys who wear sandals with socks.
"
,,
3,11,"Jason Patric. Ew!
"
,,
3,11,"Perhaps I've been looking
"
,,
3,11,"at this the wrong way.
"
,,
3,11,"I should embrace the idea
"
,,
3,11,"of having a little brother.
"
,,
3,11,"After all, it's obvious
"
,,
3,11,"we'd make quite a formidable team.
"
,,
3,11," Two minutes to re-expansion.
"
,,
3,11," Dear God! I'll never get out of here in time.
"
,,
3,11,"Move aside. I know a short cut.
"
,,
3,11,"Mm.
"
,,
3,11,"Mm.
"
,,
3,11,"Re-expansion in 60 seconds.
"

3,11,"There's the tear duct.
"
,,
3,11,"We've gotta make him cry.
"
,,
3,11,"I think I know just the way.
"
,,
3,11,"Follow my lead.
"
,,
3,11,"Oh, Peter. I love you.
"
,,
3,11,"And I love you, Lou Gossett Junior.
"
,,
3,11,"It worked. You've got to get
"
,,
3,11,"down there so you can be born.
"
,,
3,11," I guess this is goodbye.
"
,,
3,11," For now.
"
,,
3,11,"When you're born, don't let the doctor
"
,,
3,11,"slap you on the ass. It degrades us all.
"
,,
3,11,"Give it to her good, old man.
"
,,
3,11,"Peter, wait. I've been thinking.
"
,,
3,11,"It's been a long time since
"
,,
3,11,"we had such a wonderful night.
"
,,
3,11,"It'll be impossible to spend time together
"
,,
3,11,"like this if we're raising another child.
"
,,
3,11,"I thought, you know,
"
,,
3,11,"Brian would do a lot of the work.
"
,,
3,11,"I don't know. I mean,
"

3,11,"Stewie alone needs so much attention.
"

3,11,"Maybe we should hold off
"

3,11,"on having another baby.
"

3,11," Yeah, you may be right.
"
,,
3,11," No, no! You must receive his seed!
"
,,
3,11," Look who's here!
"
,,
3,11," But, Lois, we still get to do it, right?
"
,,
3,11," Honey, not in front of Stewie.
"
,,
3,11," OK. Back in a minute.
"
,,
3,11,"No, no, no! Come back here this instant,
"
,,
3,11,"you fat bastard, and do her!
"
,,
3,11,"Stop! Stop it! Stop tickling me! Stop it!
"
,,
3,11,"I'll kill you, I swear to God!
"
,,
3,11,"Wha... Wha... What did you just do?
"
,,
3,11,"No!
"
,,
3,11,"You killed my brother! How could you, you...!
"
,,
3,11,"Oh, my God! The twinkle. He's alive.
"
,,
3,11,"Well played, sperm brother. Well played.
"

3,12,"Oh... well...

"

"

"

3,12,"and coronae, which seem to be domes over
"

3,12,"large magma chambers. Here's five dollars.
"

3,12,"That's OK, Dad. I was thinking about getting
"

3,12,"a paper route so I could buy her gift myself.
"
,,
3,12,"I think that's very sweet, honey.

3,12," Uh, thanks.
"

3,12,"Got a nice tip for you right here

3,12,"That's OK, mister.

3,12,"I don't collect till the end of the month.

,,
3,12,"You wanna remove us from the area?
"
,,
3,12,"This man will stop at nothing. We're placing
"
,,
3,12,"you all in the Witness Protection Program.
"
,,
3,12,"Is Europe an option? I've always wanted
"
,,
3,12,"to spend a year in Prague teaching English.
"
,,
3,12,"Slacking off,
"
,,
3,12,"but really getting to know myself.
"
,,
3,12,"Until we catch this guy,
"
,,
3,12,"you'll be relocated to the Deep South.
"
,,
3,12,"The Deep South?
"
,,
3,12,"Where the black guys are really lazy,
"
,,
3,12,"and the white guys are just as lazy but
"
,,
3,12,"they're mad at the black guys for being lazy?
"
,,
3,12,"Jenkins and I have been assigned
"
,,
3,12,"to live here and watch your house.
"
,,
3,12,"He's a slovenly liberal
"
,,
3,12,"and I'm a fastidious conservative.
"
,,
3,12," I smell a sitcom!
"
,,
3,12," I suggest you start packing immediately.
"
,,
3,12,"I can't believe I have to change schools
"
,,
3,12,"because of you. This is all your fault, Lardo.
"
,,
3,12," Me? I had nothing to do with it.
"
,,
3,12," I meant Chris.
"
,,
3,12,"Oh. Yeah, Lardo.
"
,,
3,12,"Look, everybody. Here we are.
"
,,
3,12,"The town of Bumblescum.
"
,,
3,12," This is our house?
"
,,
3,12," Come on, Meg.
"
,,
3,12,"I bet if we fixed it up a little bit,
"
,,
3,12,"it could be a piece of crap.
"
,,
3,12," What's that smell?
"
,,
3,12," It's either bad meat or good cheese.
"
,,
3,12,"There's a penny underneath that couch.
"
,,
3,12,"Somebody's in the closet!
"
,,
3,12,"You know you're a redneck
"
,,
3,12,"when your gun rack has a gun rack on it.
"
,,
3,12,"You suck!
"
,,
3,12,"Oh, my. Well, it's too hot to cook anyway.
"
,,
3,12,"Peter, what's the upstairs like?
"
,,
3,12,"There's a Crunch Berry under the fridge.
"
,,
3,12,"Mom, Chris found a jar in the basement
"
,,
3,12,"and it has a hand in it.
"
,,
3,12,"I'm gonna plant it and see if a human grows.
"
,,
3,12,"Well, at least the TV gets decent reception.
"
,,
3,12,"Must be some kind of nature show.
"
,,
3,12,"Help! Help! Get it off! Aaargh!
"
,,
3,12,"Great. We're here five minutes
"
,,
3,12,"and Dad gets mauled by a rodent.
"
,,
3,12," This place is horrible.
"
,,
3,12," OK, everybody calm down.
"
,,
3,12,"We don't know anything
"
,,
3,12,"about this community.
"
,,
3,12,"I bet if we explore the town
"
,,
3,12,"we'll each find something about it we like.
"
,,
3,12,"That's a great idea.
"
,,
3,12,"I just gotta hit the can.
"
,,
3,12,"I think there's just an outhouse.
"
,,
3,12,"Hey, Lois? I don't get how this works.
"
,,
3,12,"It's just a hole.
"
,,
3,12,"I don't think it goes anywhere.
"
,,
3,12,"No, it definitely doesn't go anywhere.
"
,,
3,12,"Aaaargh!
"
,,
3,12,"Oh, God!
"
,,
3,12,"Oh, it's everywhere! Aaaaargh!
"
,,
3,12,"It's in my raccoon wounds! Oh, God!
"
,,
3,12," Excuse me, do you have an ATM?
"
,,
3,12," Over there, ma'am.
"
,,
3,12," How much you wanna take out?
"
,,
3,12," 40 dollars.
"
,,
3,12,"There's a service charge of a buck 50.
"
,,
3,12,"Do y'all accept?
"
,,
3,12,"Yes.
"
,,
3,12,"Mm. You smell like
"
,,
3,12,"the inside of my momma's purse.
"
,,
3,12,"Thank you.
"
,,
3,12,"What are those dulcet tones?
"
,,
3,12,"Why, this is the music of the angels!
"
,,
3,12," What is that magical device?
"
,,
3,12," Banjo.
"
,,
3,12,"Pluck that string.
"
,,
3,12,"Oh, I feel so deliciously white-trash.
"
,,
3,12,"Mommy, I want a mullet!
"
,,
3,12,"All right, that about does it.
"
,,
3,12," Isn't she beautiful, Brian?
"
,,
3,12," The Duke boys would be proud.
"
,,
3,12,"Yeah, and you gotta get in
"
,,
3,12,"through the window, like this.
"
,,
3,12,"OK, now you.
"
,,
3,12,"Oh, sorry. I forgot to roll yours down.
"
,,
3,12,"You all right?
"
,,
3,12,"Hello?
"
,,
3,12,"Wake up, sleepyhead.
"
,,
3,12," Hi.
"
,,
3,12," Hi.
"
,,
3,12," Are you mad at that pond?
"
,,
3,12," Shoot, no.
"
,,
3,12,"'Course, this pond did kill my grandpappy.
"
,,
3,12,"He saw his reflection, thought it was him
"
,,
3,12,"and drowned trying to save himself.
"
,,
3,12,"That's why Mom
"
,,
3,12,"doesn't let me look in the toilet.
"
,,
3,12," I'm Sam.
"
,,
3,12," I'm Chris.
"
,,
3,12,"Sam, come on in, now.
"
,,
3,12,"Well, I gotta go help my daddy bring in the
"
,,
3,12,"mud harvest. Nice making your acquaintance.
"
,,
3,12,"Oh, my God, I'm drowning!
"
,,
3,12,"That was Merle Haggard with
"
,,
3,12,"""I Kissed My Sweetie With My Fist"". Next...
"
,,
3,12,"There's one. Let's jump that.
"
,,
3,12,"Yeee-haaa!
"
,,
3,12,"That was great! Next time, let's get Meg
"
,,
3,12,"to be Boss Hogg and Chris can be Anus.
"
,,
3,12," Enos.
"
,,
3,12," What'd I say?
"
,,
3,12,"Anus.
"
,,
3,12,"Class, we have a new student joinin' us.
"
,,
3,12,"Everyone, please welcome
"
,,
3,12,"Megan Griffin, from the North.
"
,,
3,12,"What's it like there?
"
,,
3,12,"Y'all got them talkin' pictures?
"
,,
3,12," And flyin' machines?
"
,,
3,12," And perfume for your armpits?
"
,,
3,12," We sure do.
"
,,
3,12," Wow.
"
,,
3,12,"All right, that's enough questions for Megan.
"
,,
3,12,"Time to hand back last week's spelling tests.
"
,,
3,12," And it looks like Oinky's set the curve again.
"
,,
3,12," Dang.
"
,,
3,12," That is some smart pig.
"
,,
3,12," Good thing I copied off Oinky.
"
,,
3,12,"Ta-da! Possum surprise.
"
,,
3,12,"Actually, I made it with Shake 'n Bake.
"
,,
3,12," And I helped.
"
,,
3,12," Kids, where's your father?
"
,,
3,12,"Yeee-haaa!
"
,,
3,12," What the hell are you doing?!
"
,,
3,12," Blendin' in. Relax, Lois. It's not our house.
"
,,
3,12,"I'm glad you're having fun, but we need
"
,,
3,12,"money. Have you thought about a job?
"
,,
3,12,"Yes, Lois, I have. But I've also thought
"
,,
3,12,"about getting fired from that job.
"
,,
3,12,"Is that something you wanna put our family
"
,,
3,12,"through? Think about that while I get a drink.
"
,,
3,12,"Aaagh! Aaargh! Oh, God! Aaagh!
"
,,
3,12,"It's right up here past this clearing.
"
,,
3,12," He's been here about three months now.
"
,,
3,12," Wow.
"
,,
3,12,"Where do you think you go when you die?
"
,,
3,12,"I learned at church that
"
,,
3,12,"if you're good you go to heaven.
"
,,
3,12,"If you're bad, you go to a place
"
,,
3,12,"where the dead believe they're still livin'
"
,,
3,12,"and they pray for death,
"
,,
3,12,"but death won't come.
"
,,
3,12,"UPN?
"
,,
3,12," You're funny. I like you, Chris.
"
,,
3,12," I like you too, Sam.
"
,,
3,12," Wanna poke him?
"
,,
3,12," Do I?!
"
,,
3,12,"You know, it's true.
"
,,
3,12,"The best things in life really are free.
"
,,
3,12,"I don't know. Maybe Lois is right.
"
,,
3,12,"Maybe it is time for me to get a job.
"
,,
3,12,"You always blow it in the interview.
"
,,
3,12,"So, Peter, where do you see yourself
"
,,
3,12,"in five years?
"
,,
3,12,"Don't say ""Doing your wife. ""
"
,,
3,12,"Doing your...
"
,,
3,12,"son?
"
,,
3,12,"Hey, Brian. Look at that.
"
,,
3,12,"Y'all interested? We take turns being sheriff.
"
,,
3,12,"You just hang out here, eat pie and get drunk.
"
,,
3,12,"Hold on a second. ""Pie""? ""Drunk""? ""The""?
"
,,
3,12,"You got yourself a sheriff!
"
,,
3,12," Boy, it's so quiet around here.
"
,,
3,12," I know.
"
,,
3,12,"The phone hasn't rung all day.
"
,,
3,12,"I kn... I know. There's nothin'...
"
,,
3,12,"nothin' to, um...
"
,,
3,12,"to, uh...
"
,,
3,12,"um...
"
,,
3,12,"uh... Oh, boy,
"
,,
3,12,"what's the word I'm looking for? Do.
"
,,
3,12,"Brian, you're drunk. You're drunk.
"
,,
3,12,"Give me your keys.
"
,,
3,12," What is this, Dad?
"
,,
3,12," A Southern tradition, son.
"
,,
3,12,"It's a re-enactment of the Civil War.
"
,,
3,12,"Robert E Lee. I knew I'd find you here,
"
,,
3,12,"where they seat the sorry-ass losers.
"
,,
3,12,"Ulysses S Grant, you invite me to lunch
"
,,
3,12,"then show up an hour late, drunk?
"
,,
3,12,"I was busy lookin' for your wife,
"
,,
3,12,"to give her the old...
"
,,
3,12,"Sir, this means war.
"
,,
3,12,"I am vanquished.
"
,,
3,12,"I hereby declare victory
"
,,
3,12,"in the name of the Confederacy.
"
,,
3,12,"Excuse me. I don't think
"
,,
3,12,"that's how it happened.
"
,,
3,12," I'm pretty sure the North won.
"
,,
3,12," What are you sayin'?
"
,,
3,12,"That drunken idiot kicked your sorry asses
"
,,
3,12,"south of the Donna Dixon Line.
"
,,
3,12,"We don't take kindly
"
,,
3,12,"to that sort of talk, mister.
"
,,
3,12,"And I sure as shoot don't want
"
,,
3,12,"your kid hangin' round with my kid.
"
,,
3,12,"And if you think I'm mad now, you gotta
"
,,
3,12,"answer to them Civil War survivors.
"
,,
3,12,"Wait! Look over there! It's an interracial
"
,,
3,12,"gay couple burning the American flag!
"
,,
3,12,"Get 'em!
"
,,
3,12," I guess we can't hang out any more.
"
,,
3,12," I guess not.
"
,,
3,12,"That sucks,
"
,,
3,12,"cos I really like spending time with you.
"
,,
3,12,"Me too.
"
,,
3,12,"What are you doing?
"
,,
3,12,"Them Griffin boys better
"
,,
3,12,"grow some wings, or start flappin' their arms.
"
,,
3,12," Lost 'em!
"
,,
3,12," Blasted Lincoln-lovers.
"
,,
3,12,"Anyone seen my foot?
"
,,
3,12,"Man, was last night weird. I kissed a boy! But
"
,,
3,12,"I really like him as a friend. His name is Sam.
"
,,
3,12," You kissed Sam last night?
"
,,
3,12," How did you know?
"
,,
3,12,"You said it out loud.
"
,,
3,12,"I heard you in the other room.
"
,,
3,12,"The weird thing is,
"
,,
3,12,"kissing Sam kind of felt right.
"
,,
3,12,"But I don't know if I can face him again.
"
,,
3,12,"Brian, what should I do?
"
,,
3,12,"I haven't been this confused
"
,,
3,12,"since the end of No Way Out.
"
,,
3,12,"How does Kevin Costner keep getting work?
"
,,
3,12," Argh! How do I shoot? How do I shoot?
"
,,
3,12," Press B button.
"
,,
3,12," Telegram for Chris Griffin.
"
,,
3,12," He's not here.
"
,,
3,12," Where is he?
"
,,
3,12," I can't release that information.
"
,,
3,12,"Oh, did I say Chris? I meant Chris's sister.
"
,,
3,12,"Oh, well, if it's for Meg,
"
,,
3,12,"that's a whole other story. Here's her address.
"
,,
3,12," What are you doing?
"
,,
3,12," You were busy. I played your guy.
"
,,
3,12," I didn't wanna play.
"
,,
3,12," So it's good for everybody.
"
,,
3,12," I'm gonna draw boobs on the Etch A Sketch.
"
,,
3,12," They'll end up square.
"
,,
3,12," Oh, hi, Chris.
"
,,
3,12," Hey.
"
,,
3,12,"Um, listen, Sam.
"
,,
3,12,"I like hangin' out with you and all,
"
,,
3,12,"it's just that I don't want
"
,,
3,12,"a romantic relationship.
"
,,
3,12," But I'd like it if we could still be friends.
"
,,
3,12," I'd like that too. Wanna go for a swim?
"
,,
3,12,"Sure.
"
,,
3,12," You're a girl?!
"
,,
3,12," Of course I am.
"
,,
3,12,"Oh, my God!
"
,,

"

"

"

3,12,"What?! Peter, that criminal is on his way here
"
,,
3,12,"to kill Chris. We gotta call the sheriff.
"
,,
3,12,"Holy crap. I'm on it, Lois.
"
,,
3,12,"Sheriff's office. Yes, this is Peter Griffin. I'd
"
,,
3,12,"like to report a criminal coming into town.
"
,,
3,12,"I'm sorry, could you repeat your name?
"
,,
3,12,"Yes, it's Peter Griffin. G-r-i-f-f-i-n.
"
,,
3,12," You're the sheriff?
"
,,
3,12," One sec, honey. I'm on the phone.
"
,,
3,12," Who's that? My wife.
"
,,
3,12," Peter, Chris is in danger!
"
,,
3,12,"Do something! Round up a posse.
"
,,
3,12,"Yeah, well, see, I kinda pissed off the whole
"
,,
3,12,"town at that Civil War re-enactment.
"
,,
3,12," What are we gonna do?
"
,,
3,12," I don't know, Lois.
"
,,
3,12,"But I feel lower than a bow-legged caterpillar.
"
,,
3,12,"Now here's Roy.
"
,,
3,12," Sure is a ding-dang of a hoedown.
"
,,
3,12," Uh-uh. This here's a hootenanny.

"
,,
3,12,"you're parked on top of a pig.
"
,,
3,12,"John Deere tractor on top of a pig.
"
,,
3,12," Sam, can I talk to you?
"
,,
3,12," Sure. But why aren't you lookin' at me?
"
,,
3,12,"Well, that's the thing. I'm no good at talking
"
,,
3,12,"to girls. That's why I ran away from you.
"
,,
3,12,"You didn't have trouble talkin' to me
"
,,
3,12,"when you thought I was a boy.
"
,,
3,12,"Yeah, that's true.
"
,,
3,12," Just pretend I'm a boy.
"
,,
3,12," OK.
"
,,
3,12,"You wanna go down
"
,,
3,12,"to the old town bridge and make out?
"
,,
3,12,"Yes, sir!
"
,,
3,12,"And in the city,
"
,,
3,12,"glasses are considered really sexy.
"
,,
3,12,"Ooooh.
"
,,
3,12,"Dang, I hope her brother
"
,,
3,12,"don't already have dibs on her.
"
,,
3,12," Where's Chris? That criminal's here.
"
,,
3,12," He's down by the old town bridge.
"
,,
3,12,"You know, my brother
"
,,
3,12,"is the one he's here to kill.
"
,,
3,12,"My daughter would absolutely love you.
"
,,
3,12,"You're so cute.
"
,,
3,12,"You're like a skinny Garth Brooks.
"
,,
3,12," Aha! I got you now, Griffin!
"
,,
3,12," Aaagh!
"
,,
3,12," Not so fast, buddy!
"
,,
3,12," Who are you?
"
,,
3,12,"You can call me Officer TJ Hooker.
"
,,
3,12,"Sheriff Officer TJ Hooker.
"
,,
3,12,"And this is my deputy, McMillan and Wife.
"
,,
3,12,"I hated TJ Hooker. And I never actually saw
"
,,
3,12,"McMillan and Wife, although I was aware of it.
"
,,
3,12,"Anyway, you're dead!
"
,,
3,12,"Ha! You're mine now, fella!
"
,,
3,12,"Aagh! Aagh!
"
,,
3,12,"Aargh! Dad! Help! Dad!
"
,,
3,12," You folks all right?
"
,,
3,12," Wow, you guys saved our lives.
"
,,
3,12,"And after I said
"
,,
3,12,"all Southerners have bad teeth
"
,,
3,12,"and the gum disease known as gingivitis.
"
,,
3,12,"We take care of our own. And as long as
"
,,
3,12,"y'all live here, y'all are Southerners too.
"
,,
3,12," Wow. Thanks.
"
,,
3,12," It's our pleasure. Sam, I'll see you at home.
"
,,
3,12,"I think the lesson here is
"
,,
3,12,"it doesn't matter where you're from,
"
,,
3,12,"as long as we're all the same religion.
"
,,
3,12," It was great having you in class, Meg.
"
,,
3,12," Thanks. I'm really gonna miss everybody.
"
,,
3,12,"We didn't have no money for a present,
"
,,
3,12,"so we all just spit in a jar.
"
,,
3,12," I can't believe you're leavin'.
"
,,
3,12," Me either.
"
,,
3,12," I'll be sure to write.
"
,,
3,12," And I'll be sure to learn to read.
"
,,
3,12,"Next time I see a dead guy, I'm gonna
"
,,
3,12,"poke him twice as hard for both of us.
"
,,
3,12,"Ah, it's so nice to be home.
"
,,
3,12,"You have 113 new messages.
"
,,
3,12,"Oh, my.
"
,,
3,12,"Uh, yeah,
"
,,
3,12,"I was just wondering... uh... mm-hm...
"
,,
3,12,"where the newspaper boy was.
"
,,
3,12,"Haven't seen a newspaper in a couple of days.
"
,,
3,12,"Wonderin' if you're ever gonna come back.
"
,,
3,12,"Guess who.
"
,,
3,12,"Sorry to leave you so many messages.
"
,,
3,12,"Just lonely here, thinkin' 'bout
"
,,
3,12,"the muscly-armed paper boy.
"
,,
3,12,"Wishin' he'd bring me some good news.
"
,,
3,12,"Where are you?
"
,,
3,12,"You're startin' to piss me off,
"
,,
3,12,"you little piggly son of a bitch. Call me.
"
,,
3,13,"I got the whole day planned.
"
,,
3,13,"First, we see the primates.
"
,,
3,13,"Then the butterfly house, bathroom break...
"
,,
3,13,"Can't we all just run around
"
,,
3,13,"in a disorganised fashion?
"
,,
3,13," Yeah!
"
,,
3,13," Monkeys throw their poo!
"
,,
3,13,"If we don't adhere to a schedule,
"
,,
3,13,"we won't see everything.
"
,,
3,13,"Kids, gas masks. Run!
"
,,
3,13,"There you are.
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, don't be such a pig, Mr Pig.
"
,,
3,13,"Now, where's Mr Sheep?
"
,,
3,13,"Is he being baa-shful?
"
,,
3,13,"That's right. You're all ripe for parody.
"
,,
3,13," Can we go now?
"
,,
3,13," Shut up! I'm having fun.
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, my, someone's awfully rude.
"
,,
3,13,"Oh! My fanny is not on the menu! What?
"
,,
3,13,"What the...? Agh! Agh!
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, God! Oh, God! Agh! Agh!
"
,,
3,13,"Here, little fella. Come get the food.
"
,,
3,13,"I have always wanted to do this.
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, here are the marsupials.
"
,,
3,13,"Peter, what the hell are you doing?!
"
,,
3,13,"Look at me, Lois, I'm Roo. Come on, Ma.
"
,,
3,13,"Let's go watch Pooh trick the bees out of
"
,,
3,13,"their honey by pretending he's a rain cloud.
"

3,13,"I am going to kick your ass.

3,13,"Wow. Does it really smell like cook...?
"

3,13,"God! She farted and it went down my throat!
"

3,13," Full house.
"

3,13," That's some poker face you've got, Peter.
"
,,
3,13," Years of practice, boys.
"
,,
3,13," Peter, you're on a roll.
"
,,
3,13,"We ought to get you down to Atlantic City.
"
,,
3,13,"Sorry, guys. Lois is making me
"
,,
3,13,"visit the in-laws this weekend.
"
,,
3,13,"Why does she bother? Me and Lois's
"
,,
3,13,"old man have never gotten along.
"
,,
3,13,"Hey, I got an email from Mr Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
3,13,"You should find some common ground
"
,,
3,13,"with your father-in-law.
"
,,
3,13,"Figure out what he likes and study up on it.
"
,,
3,13,"That's a great idea. I'll learn how to act
"
,,
3,13,"like a rich guy. I'm gonna start right now.
"
,,
3,13," You're working through Christmas!
"
,,
3,13," But, sir, what of Tiny Tim?
"
,,
3,13,"Bah! He and his ukulele shall go wanting.
"
,,
3,13,"The New Yorker. I bet Lois's dad reads this.

3,13,"Oh, I get it. That's kind of funny.

3,13,"Yeah, can I have a copy of Jugs?
"
,,
3,13,"In French, when you want
"
,,
3,13,"to say ""yes"", you say ""oui, oui"".
"
,,
3,13,"You gotta be kidding me!
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, my God! That is hysterical!
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, man! And what do you say
"
,,
3,13,"for no? ""Doo-doo""?
"
,,
3,13,"I'll be right back.
"
,,
3,13,"I gotta go take a wicked ""yes"".
"
,,
3,13," Ohh.
"
,,
3,13," It's a person.
"
,,
3,13," Would you fix the bathroom faucet?
"
,,
3,13," I fixed it already.
"
,,
3,13," No, you didn't. It's still dripping.
"
,,
3,13," I'll give you all my Star Wars cards if it is.
"
,,
3,13,"Wait, wait. Except Boba Fett. No matter
"
,,
3,13,"how sure I am, I never risk the Fett man.
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,13," Was he just mastur...?
"
,,
3,13," Yes.
"
,,
3,13," Oh, my.
"
,,
3,13," Do we... do we rub his nose in it?
"
,,
3,13," Oh, hi, Brian.
"
,,
3,13," Listen, Lois, about yesterday...
"
,,
3,13,"It's nothing to be embarrassed about.
"
,,
3,13,"It's perfectly normal.
"
,,
3,13,"I know. It's just, I should be able
"
,,
3,13,"to control my baser instincts,
"
,,
3,13,"but lately I've just been having these urges.
"
,,
3,13,"Why don't you come to my parents' house?
"
,,
3,13,"The fresh air will help you relax.
"
,,
3,13,"Mm, I know where I go when I want to relax.
"
,,
3,13," I know the guy that owns this place!
"
,,
3,13," What?!
"
,,
3,13,"I said, I know the guy that...
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, I'll tell you later. I love this song.
"
,,
3,13,"Thanks, but I think a quiet weekend
"
,,
3,13,"by myself is just the thing I need.
"
,,
3,13,"Well, have a good time.
"
,,
3,13,"I'm gonna relax, mellow out,
"
,,
3,13,"and watch some television.
"
,,
3,13,"We now return to
"
,,
3,13,"""World's Sluttiest Dogs"" on Fox.
"
,,
3,13,"Hey, wait up!
"
,,
3,13,"Right into the bumper.
"
,,
3,13," Hi, Mom.
"
,,
3,13," Oh, look at you all.
"
,,
3,13,"I know someone who's getting a gift
"
,,
3,13,"certificate for liposuction in her stocking.
"
,,
3,13," Thank you.
"
,,
3,13," Hello, everyone.
"
,,
3,13," Hi, Daddy.
"
,,
3,13," Bonjour, Monsieur Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
3,13," Did Peter have a stroke?
"
,,
3,13," He's cultured himself, like Pretty Woman.
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, so I should treat him
"
,,
3,13,"like a high-class whore.
"
,,
3,13,"That's fine. Just no kissing on the lips.
"
,,
3,13," Would you like a piece of candy?
"
,,
3,13," I smell death on you.
"
,,
3,13,"Ahoy, Mr Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
3,13,"Permission to come aboard?
"
,,
3,13," No!
"
,,
3,13," Thanks. Quite a schooner you got here.
"
,,
3,13," What is she? A 45-footer?
"
,,
3,13," Peter, I didn't know you were a sailor.
"
,,
3,13,"I didn't know you looked
"
,,
3,13,"so good in shorts.
"
,,
3,13," What?
"
,,
3,13," You don't have an eye spliced in this line.
"
,,
3,13,"I'll tie a bowline in there and make one.
"
,,
3,13,"That should hold her.
"
,,
3,13," And this is a '74 Pinot Noir.
"
,,
3,13," Mmm, lovely.
"
,,
3,13,"Carter, did you tell your son-in-law
"
,,
3,13,"he's not supposed to swallow the wine?
"
,,
3,13,"Hey, where the hell is that Peter Griffin?
"
,,
3,13,"He said he'd give me a hundred dollars
"
,,
3,13,"if I took off all my clothes off.
"
,,
3,13,"Thanks for bringing me.
"
,,
3,13,"This is just what I needed.
"
,,
3,13,"I'm glad. It seems like
"
,,
3,13,"everybody's having a lot of fun.
"
,,
3,13," How long are you and your family in...?
"
,,
3,13," Uh-uh-uh-uh. No conversation.
"
,,
3,13,"You idiot! I'm never taking you
"
,,
3,13,"to my country club again!
"
,,
3,13," I'm sorry, Mr Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
3,13," Your husband is a moron!
"
,,
3,13,"He walks up to the premier of China
"
,,
3,13,"and says ""Dong, where is my automobile?""
"
,,
3,13,"I tried to fit in with your dad's crowd,
"
,,
3,13,"but it's worse than before.
"
,,
3,13,"This sucks worse than that time
"
,,
3,13,"I was on Survivor.
"
,,
3,13,"How dare you wash your clothes
"
,,
3,13,"in our drinking water, Bebe?
"
,,
3,13,"Now how are we gonna survive
"
,,
3,13,"in this harsh, unforgiving terrain?
"
,,
3,13,"Make sure the wheel goes all the way around.
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, no. Head-hunters. Am I fired?
"
,,
3,13,"Peter's been trying really hard
"
,,
3,13,"to get you to like him.
"
,,
3,13,"Give him another chance?
"
,,
3,13,"Let him join your poker game?
"
,,
3,13,"I'd rather be stuck in an elevator
"
,,
3,13,"with Nathan Lane, Gilbert Gottfried,
"
,,
3,13,"Carrot Top, uh... Sean Hayes...
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, you get the picture.
"
,,
3,13," Please?
"
,,
3,13," No!
"
,,
3,13,"OK. You know, maybe later
"
,,
3,13,"I'll take Mom by the shoeshine place
"
,,
3,13,"and introduce her to that mulatto boy
"
,,
3,13,"who looks a lot like...
"
,,
3,13," Would Peter like to play poker with us?
"
,,
3,13," He'd love to.
"
,,
3,13,"That sounds dynamite.
"
,,
3,13,"Brian, come here and meet Sea Breeze,
"
,,
3,13,"my prize-winning dog.
"
,,
3,13,"Isn't she a perfect specimen?
"
,,
3,13,"Look at these legs and that beautiful coat.
"
,,
3,13,"Feel the heat coming off of her genitalia.
"
,,
3,13,"You could roast a marshmallow.
"
,,
3,13,"That's how you can tell she's a champion.
"
,,
3,13,"Go on. Put your hand there.
"
,,
3,13," Oh... That is...
"
,,
3,13," Is that something?
"
,,
3,13,"That is something. That is... that is hot.
"
,,
3,13,"Isn't she the most beautiful dog?
"
,,
3,13,"Yes. Yes, she is a beautiful dog.
"
,,
3,13,"And that's OK.
"
,,
3,13,"This is Peter.
"
,,
3,13,"He's the idiot my daughter married.
"
,,
3,13," Michael Eisner.
"
,,
3,13," Bill Gates.
"
,,
3,13,"Peter's an anti-trust lawyer
"
,,
3,13,"with the Justice Department.
"
,,
3,13,"Just kidding. He's a fisherman
"
,,
3,13,"or some stupid thing.
"
,,
3,13," Hey, fellas.
"
,,
3,13," Wow! Ted Turner!
"
,,
3,13," I told you not to invite him.
"
,,
3,13," He must have followed us.
"
,,
3,13,"Come on, ladies. Are we gonna play cards?
"
,,
3,13," Peter, why don't you deal?
"
,,
3,13," We're playing Texas Hold 'Em.
"
,,
3,13," Are aces high or low?
"
,,
3,13," They go both ways.
"
,,
3,13,"He said ""They go both ways. ""
"
,,
3,13," Like a bisexual.
"
,,
3,13," Thank you, Ted. That was the joke.
"
,,
3,13," I see your bet, and I raise you CNN.
"
,,
3,13," Oh, I don't think I can...
"
,,
3,13,"You can beat him, Mr Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
3,13,"He's bluffing.
"
,,
3,13,"He bet CNN. There's no way he's bluffing.
"
,,
3,13,"I'm sure he is. He's got a tell. If you
"
,,
3,13,"lose this hand, I'll divorce your daughter.
"
,,
3,13,"I'm in. All right, Teddy. I'll see your CNN
"
,,
3,13,"with US Steel. What have you got?
"
,,
3,13," Two pair.
"
,,
3,13," Ace-high straight.
"
,,
3,13,"You sold me out. I could use a man
"
,,
3,13,"like you. How's a million a year?
"
,,
3,13,"You disgust me! Get out of my face!
"
,,
3,13,"That's the first time
"
,,
3,13,"any of us have beaten Ted.
"
,,
3,13," How'd you know he was bluffing?
"
,,
3,13," When he lies, he blinks twice.
"
,,
3,13,"I noticed it when he did an interview
"
,,
3,13,"and said he'd be with Jane Fonda for ever.
"
,,
3,13,"I'm gonna turn in.
"
,,
3,13,"Me too. I gotta be at Disneyland. We're
"
,,
3,13,"ethnically cleansing the Small World ride.
"
,,
3,13,"You guys practically run this country.
"
,,
3,13,"There's gotta be a ton
"
,,
3,13,"of fun stuff we could do.
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, man, there's a toll booth.
"
,,
3,13,"Anybody got a quarter?
"
,,
3,13," What's a quarter?
"
,,
3,13," Well, we gotta give him something.
"
,,
3,13,"Man. Looking up at the sky
"
,,
3,13,"just makes you feel so small.
"
,,
3,13,"Yeah. I mean, if God created
"
,,
3,13,"all this, who created God?
"
,,
3,13," Maybe he created himself.
"
,,
3,13," Or herself.
"
,,
3,13," Ohh...
"
,,
3,13," Think about that.
"
,,
3,13,"Neat. This guy's deep. Where'd you find him?
"
,,
3,13,"He's my son-in-law.
"
,,
3,13," OK, honey. I gotta go. You want a ride?
"
,,
3,13," Sure.
"
,,
3,13," Wow.
"
,,
3,13," I actually had a good time with you tonight.
"
,,
3,13,"And I just want to say...
"
,,
3,13,"I'm glad you married my daughter.
"
,,
3,13," Thank you, Jesus.
"
,,
3,13," Actually, it wasn't me, it was...
"
,,
3,13,"No, no, it's OK. I'm used to it.
"
,,
3,13," Having fun, Peter?
"
,,
3,13," I put all my poker winnings on your dog.
"
,,
3,13,"Dog?
"
,,
3,13,"Nothing to worry about.
"
,,
3,13,"Sea Breeze is a sure thing.
"
,,
3,13," Sea Breeze?
"
,,
3,13," Dad, where are the jockeys?
"
,,
3,13,"They're all in the laundry.
"
,,
3,13,"I'm going Indian today.
"
,,
3,13," Oh, come on, Sea Breeze!
"
,,
3,13," Sea Breeze! Yeah!
"
,,
3,13," Come on! Go! Go!
"
,,
3,13," Come on!
"
,,
3,13,"What's Brian doing?
"
,,
3,13," Oh, my God.
"
,,
3,13," He's violating Sea Breeze.
"
,,
3,13,"No, he's awkwardly positioning himself...
"
,,
3,13,"Now he's violating Sea Breeze.
"
,,
3,13,"Again, I want to tell you how sorry I am
"
,,
3,13,"about this. I don't know what came over me.
"
,,
3,13,"You had better not have ruined my race dog.
"
,,
3,13,"I am very disappointed in you!
"
,,
3,13,"I'd turn my back, but I've seen
"
,,
3,13,"what you do in that situation.
"
,,
3,13,"Now, Carter and I have
"
,,
3,13,"a polio match to attend.
"
,,
3,13,"Get away from me! You and that filthy
"
,,
3,13,"mongrel of yours! How is she, Doctor?
"
,,
3,13,"She's fine. Sea Breeze
"
,,
3,13,"will be able to race again.
"
,,
3,13,"But, unfortunately, not for
"
,,
3,13,"another nine weeks. She's pregnant.
"
,,
3,13,"I just want you to know I am
"
,,
3,13,"going to do the right thing here.
"
,,
3,13,"You're never going to see Sea Breeze again!
"
,,
3,13," Pack your things and get out!
"
,,
3,13," I am never speaking to you again.
"
,,
3,13,"Don't worry. I have a plan.
"
,,
3,13,"I am gonna go back in time and stop
"
,,
3,13,"Brian from getting it on with your dog.
"
,,
3,13,"Everybody stand back.
"
,,
3,13,"Aah!
"
,,
3,13,"Oh... Oh... Oh, boy... Oh... Oh...
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, God. Agh. Agh.
"
,,
3,13,"Mr Pewterschmidt,
"
,,
3,13,"please can we still be pals?
"
,,
3,13,"See. I made a picture of you and me
"
,,
3,13,"out of glue and macaroni.
"
,,
3,13,"That means a lot to me because you made it.
"
,,
3,13," Really?
"
,,
3,13," No! Get out!
"
,,
3,13," Mr Pewterschmidt, Sea Breeze is gone!
"
,,
3,13," What?
"
,,
3,13,"I can't find Brian.
"
,,
3,13,"Peter, do you know what I'm going to do
"
,,
3,13,"to you if Brian took off with my Sea Breeze?
"
,,
3,13,"I think I have an idea.
"
,,
3,13,"This is the room. The light switch
"
,,
3,13,"is here. It's mostly for show.
"
,,
3,13,"There's your Murphy Bed. Don't mind
"
,,
3,13,"the Epsteins. They keep to themselves.
"
,,
3,13,"We're going to see Bobby Darin
"
,,
3,13,"at the Copa tomorrow, right, Charlie?
"
,,
3,13,"Bobby Darin, tomorrow.
"
,,
3,13,"This is the bathroom.
"
,,
3,13,"Watch out, we got some bad roaches.
"
,,
3,13," You're on our turf, man.
"
,,
3,13," Man, I'll cut you.
"
,,
3,13,"I'll cut you up so bad
"
,,
3,13,"you gonna wish I no cut you up so bad.
"
,,
3,13," Those are bad roaches.
"
,,
3,13," I blame the schools.
"
,,
3,13," Were you followed?
"
,,
3,13," Don't worry. I've got a decoy.
"
,,
3,13,"Hey, Lois. Hubba-hubba.
"
,,
3,13,"Whoa, Lois, you put on a few, huh?
"
,,
3,13,"Well, I never!
"
,,
3,13,"That's all right, I don't think he was the one.
"
,,
3,13,"Let's go get sundaes.
"
,,
3,13,"We all really miss you.
"
,,
3,13,"And Peter talks about you all the time.
"
,,
3,13," Oh, really? Anything nice?
"
,,
3,13," No.
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, so he's still mad, huh?
"
,,
3,13,"I should go. Take this. It's probably
"
,,
3,13,"not a good idea for us to meet any more.
"
,,
3,13,"Daddy swore he'd track you down
"
,,
3,13,"any way he could.
"
,,
3,13," Bingo!
"
,,
3,13," I told you she'd lead us to him.
"
,,
3,13," Let's call Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
3,13," Let's take the jet packs.
"
,,
3,13,"Cool!
"
,,
3,13,"Man, the people look like ants from up here.
"
,,
3,13,"They are ants, Michael. They are ants.
"
,,
3,13,"This is Tricia Takanawa live
"
,,
3,13,"where police have discovered
"
,,
3,13,"the whereabouts of Sea Breeze,
"
,,
3,13,"the heiress to the Pewterschmidt fortune.
"
,,
3,13,"The dognapper has been traced
"
,,
3,13,"to this sleazy motel.
"
,,
3,13,"Ah, I see my colleague Tom Tucker
"
,,
3,13,"is already on the scene.
"
,,
3,13,"Who's that, baby?
"
,,
3,13,"Hello, this is Tom Tucker's
"
,,
3,13,"evil twin Todd Tucker
"
,,
3,13,"out to destroy his brother's reputation.
"
,,
3,13,"Ha-ha-ha.
"
,,
3,13,"I'm going inside to have freaky sex with my
"
,,
3,13,"prostitute with whom I still have 45 minutes.
"
,,
3,13,"Back to this breaking news.
"
,,
3,13,"Brian, please eat something.
"
,,
3,13,"My face is on the news. Your father won't
"
,,
3,13,"let me see the dog carrying my puppies.
"
,,
3,13,"And he's going to incredible lengths
"
,,
3,13,"to ignore me.
"
,,
3,13,"Brian, don't let him get to you.
"
,,
3,13,"Peter, come out of that thing!
"
,,
3,13,"He can't hear you. Besides, it's not him
"
,,
3,13,"that's getting to me, it's your father.
"
,,
3,13,"I'm sorry. I talked to him, but he
"
,,
3,13,"wouldn't budge. He can be so stubborn.
"
,,
3,13,"I don't know how my mother puts up with it.
"
,,
3,13,"He did promise to take care of the puppies.
"
,,
3,13,"They're not his to take care of. They're
"
,,
3,13,"my kids, and I'm gonna get 'em back.
"
,,
3,13,"My father wasn't there for me,
"
,,
3,13,"but I'll be there for my kids!
"
,,
3,13,"I'm gonna sue your dad for custody!
"
,,
3,13,"Please stop this. Brian has every right
"
,,
3,13,"to see his puppies when they're born.
"
,,
3,13,"Sorry, pumpkin.
"
,,
3,13,"I had no idea you could be so cruel.
"
,,
3,13,"I'll never forgive you for this!
"
,,
3,13," You're just having your period.
"
,,
3,13," This court will now come to order.
"
,,
3,13," Brian, do you like children?
"
,,
3,13," I love children. That's why I'm here.
"
,,
3,13,"I want the opportunity to raise my puppies.
"
,,
3,13,"Do you remember an incident at a South
"
,,
3,13,"Attleboro Denny's in December of 1996?
"
,,
3,13,"Yeah, I guess.
"
,,
3,13,"Waa! Waa! You like that, huh?!
"
,,
3,13,"You like that?! Waa!
"
,,
3,13,"You just tune this out, don't you?!
"
,,
3,13,"Waa! Well, tune this out! Waa!
"
,,
3,13," Aah...
"
,,
3,13," Waa!
"
,,
3,13," Aah...
"
,,
3,13," Waa!
"
,,
3,13," Aah...
"
,,
3,13," Shut up!
"
,,
3,13,"I was angry because my Moon Over
"
,,
3,13,"My Hammy was overcooked and...
"
,,
3,13,"I also have your rental records
"
,,
3,13,"from the Quahog Video Store.
"
,,
3,13," Can you read the last two titles?
"
,,
3,13," Son In Law and Bio-Dome.
"
,,
3,13," And who's the star of those films?
"
,,
3,13," Pauly Shore.
"
,,
3,13,"Pauly Shore!
"
,,
3,13,"He's terrible.
"
,,
3,13,"I rented those for Peter. He got banned
"
,,
3,13,"from the store for taping over movies.
"
,,
3,13,"Rosebud.
"
,,
3,13,"It's his sled. It was his sled
"
,,
3,13,"from when he was a kid.
"
,,
3,13,"There, I just saved you
"
,,
3,13,"two long boobless hours.
"
,,
3,13,"How convenient. Blame it on someone else.
"
,,
3,13,"Is that the man we want
"
,,
3,13,"raising these puppies?
"
,,
3,13,"Peter? Oh, you've gotta
"
,,
3,13,"believe me, Your Honour.
"
,,
3,13,"Peter, I'm putting together
"
,,
3,13,"another card game. You in?
"
,,
3,13," You... you want me to play?
"
,,
3,13," Absolutely.
"
,,
3,13,"But first I want you to testify
"
,,
3,13,"against that horny mutt of yours.
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, I don't know if I can do that.
"
,,
3,13,"That's too bad, because Bill and Michael
"
,,
3,13,"want to see you again.
"
,,
3,13,"Bill's going to bring his Stretch Armstrong.
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, man, and his arms
"
,,
3,13,"stretch out to next week!
"
,,
3,13,"Your Honour, Peter Griffin
"
,,
3,13,"would like to take the stand.
"
,,
3,13,"Mr Griffin, which of the following two
"
,,
3,13,"phrases best describes Brian Griffin?
"
,,
3,13,"Problem drinker,
"
,,
3,13,"or African-American haberdasher?
"
,,
3,13," I guess problem drinker, but that's...
"
,,
3,13," Thank you.
"
,,
3,13,"Sexual deviant, or magic picture that if you
"
,,
3,13,"stare at it long enough, you see something?
"
,,
3,13," Sexual deviant, but that one's not...
"
,,
3,13," Thank you.
"
,,
3,13,"Now, isn't it true that you told my client
"
,,
3,13,"that Brian is a menace to society
"
,,
3,13,"and should never be allowed
"
,,
3,13,"to see his children?
"
,,
3,13,"Um... Uh...
"
,,
3,13,"Brian should be allowed to see his puppies!
"
,,
3,13," Peter, think about what you're doing.
"
,,
3,13," I am. Your Honour, Brian'll be a great dad.
"
,,
3,13,"If I was half the parent he is,
"
,,
3,13,"I'd know Chris's favourite ice cream is...
"
,,
3,13," Chocolate-chip.
"
,,
3,13," Stewie's favourite bedtime story is...
"
,,
3,13," Goodnight, Moon.
"
,,
3,13," Meg's real father's name is...
"
,,
3,13,"Stan Thompson.
"
,,
3,13,"I've heard enough. I do believe
"
,,
3,13,"that Brian would be a successful parent.
"
,,
3,13,"If he was to repeat his actions, he would
"
,,
3,13,"be setting a bad example for his puppies.
"
,,
3,13,"Therefore, I grant Brian custody
"
,,
3,13,"with the condition that he be neutered first.
"
,,
3,13,"Yeah! You did it, buddy! Oh, congratulations!
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, man! What does ""neutered"" mean?
"
,,
3,13,"You're almost there, Sea Breeze.
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, and also, I didn't bring this up before,
"
,,
3,13,"but promise me you won't eat any of them.
"
,,
3,13,"This is like a Greek tragedy where a man
"
,,
3,13,"chooses between himself and his children.
"
,,
3,13,"Of course, you'll be playing
"
,,
3,13,"the role of ""Sans Testiclese"".
"
,,
3,13,"We're ready for you down the hall.
"
,,
3,13,"Sure you want to go through with this?
"
,,
3,13,"You could have puppies with another dog.
"
,,
3,13,"And maybe with a condor!
"
,,
3,13,"Yeah, then you'd have flying puppies.
"
,,
3,13,"Would you like that, Brian?
"
,,
3,13,"Huh? Flying puppies?
"
,,
3,13,"No. Those puppies in there are mine.
"
,,
3,13,"And I'll give anything
"
,,
3,13,"to be with them. Anything.
"
,,
3,13,"I am not looking forward to what you're
"
,,
3,13,"gonna be like once they do this to you.
"
,,
3,13,"Mmm. I love chocolate.
"
,,
3,13,"But I can't eat it because then I'll get fat.
"
,,
3,13,"But it's so good!
"
,,
3,13," Are you ready, Brian?
"
,,
3,13," I guess so.
"
,,
3,13,"Stop! Brian, come quick!
"
,,
3,13," Oh, my God! Those aren't my puppies!
"
,,
3,13," Then whose are they?
"
,,
3,13,"You! You're a whore! A filthy, filthy whore!
"
,,
3,13,"You must be so relieved.
"
,,
3,13,"Actually, I... I was kind of
"
,,
3,13,"looking forward to being a dad.
"
,,
3,13,"Don't worry. There'll be other chances.
"
,,
3,13,"Hey, you know what's funny?
"
,,
3,13,"I always thought that dogs... laid eggs.
"
,,
3,13,"And I learned something today.

3,13," Hi, Daddy.
"
,,
3,13," Bonjour, Monsieur Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
3,13," Did Peter have a stroke?
"
,,
3,13," He's cultured himself, like Pretty Woman.
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, so I should treat him
"
,,
3,13,"like a high-class whore.
"
,,
3,13,"That's fine. Just no kissing on the lips.
"
,,
3,13," Would you like a piece of candy?
"
,,
3,13," I smell death on you.
"
,,
3,13,"Ahoy, Mr Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
3,13,"Permission to come aboard?
"
,,
3,13," No!
"
,,
3,13," Thanks. Quite a schooner you got here.
"
,,
3,13," What is she? A 45-footer?
"
,,
3,13," Peter, I didn't know you were a sailor.
"
,,
3,13,"I didn't know you looked
"
,,
3,13,"so good in shorts.
"
,,
3,13," What?
"
,,
3,13," You don't have an eye spliced in this line.
"
,,
3,13,"I'll tie a bowline in there and make one.
"
,,
3,13,"That should hold her.
"
,,
3,13," And this is a '74 Pinot Noir.
"
,,
3,13," Mmm, lovely.
"
,,
3,13,"Carter, did you tell your son-in-law
"
,,
3,13,"he's not supposed to swallow the wine?
"
,,
3,13,"Hey, where the hell is that Peter Griffin?
"
,,
3,13,"He said he'd give me a hundred dollars
"
,,
3,13,"if I took off all my clothes off.
"
,,
3,13,"Thanks for bringing me.
"
,,
3,13,"This is just what I needed.
"
,,
3,13,"I'm glad. It seems like
"
,,
3,13,"everybody's having a lot of fun.
"
,,
3,13," How long are you and your family in...?
"
,,
3,13," Uh-uh-uh-uh. No conversation.
"
,,
3,13,"You idiot! I'm never taking you
"
,,
3,13,"to my country club again!
"
,,
3,13," I'm sorry, Mr Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
3,13," Your husband is a moron!
"
,,
3,13,"He walks up to the premier of China
"
,,
3,13,"and says ""Dong, where is my automobile?""
"
,,
3,13,"I tried to fit in with your dad's crowd,
"
,,
3,13,"but it's worse than before.
"
,,
3,13,"This sucks worse than that time
"
,,
3,13,"I was on Survivor.

,,
3,13,"How dare you wash your clothes
"
,,
3,13,"in our drinking water, Bebe?
"
,,
3,13,"Now how are we gonna survive
"
,,
3,13,"in this harsh, unforgiving terrain?
"
,,
3,13,"Make sure the wheel goes all the way around.
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, no. Head-hunters. Am I fired?
"
,,
3,13,"Peter's been trying really hard
"
,,
3,13,"to get you to like him.
"
,,
3,13,"Give him another chance?
"
,,
3,13,"Let him join your poker game?
"
,,
3,13,"I'd rather be stuck in an elevator
"
,,
3,13,"with Nathan Lane, Gilbert Gottfried,
"
,,
3,13,"Carrot Top, uh... Sean Hayes...
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, you get the picture.
"
,,
3,13," Please?
"
,,
3,13," No!
"
,,
3,13,"OK. You know, maybe later
"
,,
3,13,"I'll take Mom by the shoeshine place
"

3,13,"and introduce her to that mulatto boy
"
,,
3,13,"who looks a lot like...
"
,,
3,13," Would Peter like to play poker with us?
"
,,
3,13," He'd love to.
"
,,
3,13,"That sounds dynamite.
"
,,
3,13,"Brian, come here and meet Sea Breeze,
"
,,
3,13,"my prize-winning dog.
"
,,
3,13,"Isn't she a perfect specimen?
"
,,
3,13,"Look at these legs and that beautiful coat.
"
,,
3,13,"Feel the heat coming off of her genitalia.
"
,,
3,13,"You could roast a marshmallow.
"
,,
3,13,"That's how you can tell she's a champion.
"
,,
3,13,"Go on. Put your hand there.
"
,,
3,13," Oh... That is...
"
,,
3,13," Is that something?
"
,,
3,13,"That is something. That is... that is hot.
"
,,
3,13,"Isn't she the most beautiful dog?
"
,,
3,13,"Yes. Yes, she is a beautiful dog.
"
,,
3,13,"And that's OK.
"
,,
3,13,"This is Peter.
"
,,
3,13,"He's the idiot my daughter married.
"
,,
3,13," Michael Eisner.
"
,,
3,13," Bill Gates.
"
,,
3,13,"Peter's an anti-trust lawyer
"
,,
3,13,"with the Justice Department.
"
,,
3,13,"Just kidding. He's a fisherman
"
,,
3,13,"or some stupid thing.
"
,,
3,13," Hey, fellas.
"
,,
3,13," Wow! Ted Turner!
"
,,
3,13," I told you not to invite him.
"
,,
3,13," He must have followed us.
"
,,
3,13,"Come on, ladies. Are we gonna play cards?
"
,,
3,13," Peter, why don't you deal?
"
,,
3,13," We're playing Texas Hold 'Em.
"
,,
3,13," Are aces high or low?
"
,,
3,13," They go both ways.
"
,,
3,13,"He said ""They go both ways. ""
"
,,
3,13," Like a bisexual.
"
,,
3,13," Thank you, Ted. That was the joke.
"
,,
3,13," I see your bet, and I raise you CNN.
"
,,
3,13," Oh, I don't think I can...
"
,,
3,13,"You can beat him, Mr Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
3,13,"He's bluffing.
"
,,
3,13,"He bet CNN. There's no way he's bluffing.
"
,,
3,13,"I'm sure he is. He's got a tell. If you
"
,,
3,13,"lose this hand, I'll divorce your daughter.
"
,,
3,13,"I'm in. All right, Teddy. I'll see your CNN
"
,,
3,13,"with US Steel. What have you got?
"
,,
3,13," Two pair.
"
,,
3,13," Ace-high straight.
"
,,
3,13,"You sold me out. I could use a man
"
,,
3,13,"like you. How's a million a year?
"
,,
3,13,"You disgust me! Get out of my face!
"
,,
3,13,"That's the first time
"
,,
3,13,"any of us have beaten Ted.
"
,,
3,13," How'd you know he was bluffing?
"
,,
3,13," When he lies, he blinks twice.
"
,,
3,13,"I noticed it when he did an interview
"
,,
3,13,"and said he'd be with Jane Fonda for ever.
"
,,
3,13,"I'm gonna turn in.
"
,,
3,13,"Me too. I gotta be at Disneyland. We're
"
,,
3,13,"ethnically cleansing the Small World ride.
"
,,
3,13,"You guys practically run this country.
"
,,
3,13,"There's gotta be a ton
"
,,
3,13,"of fun stuff we could do.
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, man, there's a toll booth.
"
,,
3,13,"Anybody got a quarter?
"
,,
3,13," What's a quarter?
"
,,
3,13," Well, we gotta give him something.
"
,,
3,13,"Man. Looking up at the sky
"
,,
3,13,"just makes you feel so small.
"
,,
3,13,"Yeah. I mean, if God created
"
,,
3,13,"all this, who created God?
"
,,
3,13," Maybe he created himself.
"
,,
3,13," Or herself.
"
,,
3,13," Ohh...
"
,,
3,13," Think about that.
"
,,
3,13,"Neat. This guy's deep. Where'd you find him?
"
,,
3,13,"He's my son-in-law.
"
,,
3,13," OK, honey. I gotta go. You want a ride?
"
,,
3,13," Sure.
"
,,
3,13," Wow.
"
,,
3,13," I actually had a good time with you tonight.
"
,,
3,13,"And I just want to say...
"
,,
3,13,"I'm glad you married my daughter.
"
,,
3,13," Thank you, Jesus.
"
,,
3,13," Actually, it wasn't me, it was...
"
,,
3,13,"No, no, it's OK. I'm used to it.
"
,,
3,13," Having fun, Peter?
"
,,
3,13," I put all my poker winnings on your dog.
"
,,
3,13,"Dog?
"
,,
3,13,"Nothing to worry about.
"
,,
3,13,"Sea Breeze is a sure thing.
"
,,
3,13," Sea Breeze?
"
,,
3,13," Dad, where are the jockeys?
"
,,
3,13,"They're all in the laundry.
"
,,
3,13,"I'm going Indian today.
"
,,
3,13," Oh, come on, Sea Breeze!
"
,,
3,13," Sea Breeze! Yeah!
"
,,
3,13," Come on! Go! Go!
"
,,
3,13," Come on!
"
,,
3,13,"What's Brian doing?
"
,,
3,13," Oh, my God.
"
,,
3,13," He's violating Sea Breeze.
"
,,
3,13,"No, he's awkwardly positioning himself...
"
,,
3,13,"Now he's violating Sea Breeze.
"
,,
3,13,"Again, I want to tell you how sorry I am
"
,,
3,13,"about this. I don't know what came over me.
"
,,
3,13,"You had better not have ruined my race dog.
"
,,
3,13,"I am very disappointed in you!
"
,,
3,13,"I'd turn my back, but I've seen
"
,,
3,13,"what you do in that situation.
"
,,
3,13,"Now, Carter and I have
"
,,
3,13,"a polio match to attend.
"
,,
3,13,"Get away from me! You and that filthy
"
,,
3,13,"mongrel of yours! How is she, Doctor?
"
,,
3,13,"She's fine. Sea Breeze
"
,,
3,13,"will be able to race again.
"
,,
3,13,"But, unfortunately, not for
"
,,
3,13,"another nine weeks. She's pregnant.
"
,,
3,13,"I just want you to know I am
"
,,
3,13,"going to do the right thing here.
"
,,
3,13,"You're never going to see Sea Breeze again!
"
,,
3,13," Pack your things and get out!
"
,,
3,13," I am never speaking to you again.
"
,,
3,13,"Don't worry. I have a plan.
"
,,
3,13,"I am gonna go back in time and stop
"
,,
3,13,"Brian from getting it on with your dog.
"
,,
3,13,"Everybody stand back.
"
,,
3,13,"Aah!
"
,,
3,13,"Oh... Oh... Oh, boy... Oh... Oh...
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, God. Agh. Agh.
"
,,
3,13,"Mr Pewterschmidt,
"
,,
3,13,"please can we still be pals?
"
,,
3,13,"See. I made a picture of you and me
"
,,
3,13,"out of glue and macaroni.
"
,,
3,13,"That means a lot to me because you made it.
"
,,
3,13," Really?
"
,,
3,13," No! Get out!
"
,,
3,13," Mr Pewterschmidt, Sea Breeze is gone!
"
,,
3,13," What?
"
,,
3,13,"I can't find Brian.
"
,,
3,13,"Peter, do you know what I'm going to do
"
,,
3,13,"to you if Brian took off with my Sea Breeze?
"
,,
3,13,"I think I have an idea.
"
,,
3,13,"This is the room. The light switch
"
,,
3,13,"is here. It's mostly for show.
"
,,
3,13,"There's your Murphy Bed. Don't mind
"
,,
3,13,"the Epsteins. They keep to themselves.
"
,,
3,13,"We're going to see Bobby Darin
"
,,
3,13,"at the Copa tomorrow, right, Charlie?
"
,,
3,13,"Bobby Darin, tomorrow.
"
,,
3,13,"This is the bathroom.
"
,,
3,13,"Watch out, we got some bad roaches.
"
,,
3,13," You're on our turf, man.
"
,,
3,13," Man, I'll cut you.
"
,,
3,13,"I'll cut you up so bad
"
,,
3,13,"you gonna wish I no cut you up so bad.
"
,,
3,13," Those are bad roaches.
"
,,
3,13," I blame the schools.
"
,,
3,13," Were you followed?
"
,,
3,13," Don't worry. I've got a decoy.
"
,,
3,13,"Hey, Lois. Hubba-hubba.
"
,,
3,13,"Whoa, Lois, you put on a few, huh?
"
,,
3,13,"Well, I never!
"
,,
3,13,"That's all right, I don't think he was the one.
"
,,
3,13,"Let's go get sundaes.
"
,,
3,13,"We all really miss you.
"
,,
3,13,"And Peter talks about you all the time.
"
,,
3,13," Oh, really? Anything nice?
"
,,
3,13," No.
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, so he's still mad, huh?
"
,,
3,13,"I should go. Take this. It's probably
"
,,
3,13,"not a good idea for us to meet any more.
"
,,
3,13,"Daddy swore he'd track you down
"
,,
3,13,"any way he could.
"
,,
3,13," Bingo!
"
,,
3,13," I told you she'd lead us to him.
"
,,
3,13," Let's call Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
3,13," Let's take the jet packs.
"
,,
3,13,"Cool!
"
,,
3,13,"Man, the people look like ants from up here.
"
,,
3,13,"They are ants, Michael. They are ants.
"
,,
3,13,"This is Tricia Takanawa live
"
,,
3,13,"where police have discovered
"
,,
3,13,"the whereabouts of Sea Breeze,
"
,,
3,13,"the heiress to the Pewterschmidt fortune.
"
,,
3,13,"The dognapper has been traced
"
,,
3,13,"to this sleazy motel.
"
,,
3,13,"Ah, I see my colleague Tom Tucker
"
,,
3,13,"is already on the scene.
"
,,
3,13,"Who's that, baby?
"
,,
3,13,"Hello, this is Tom Tucker's
"
,,
3,13,"evil twin Todd Tucker
"
,,
3,13,"out to destroy his brother's reputation.
"
,,
3,13,"Ha-ha-ha.
"
,,
3,13,"I'm going inside to have freaky sex with my
"
,,
3,13,"prostitute with whom I still have 45 minutes.
"
,,
3,13,"Back to this breaking news.
"
,,
3,13,"Brian, please eat something.
"
,,
3,13,"My face is on the news. Your father won't
"
,,
3,13,"let me see the dog carrying my puppies.
"
,,
3,13,"And he's going to incredible lengths
"
,,
3,13,"to ignore me.
"
,,
3,13,"Brian, don't let him get to you.
"
,,
3,13,"Peter, come out of that thing!
"
,,
3,13,"He can't hear you. Besides, it's not him
"
,,
3,13,"that's getting to me, it's your father.
"
,,
3,13,"I'm sorry. I talked to him, but he
"
,,
3,13,"wouldn't budge. He can be so stubborn.
"
,,
3,13,"I don't know how my mother puts up with it.
"
,,
3,13,"He did promise to take care of the puppies.
"
,,
3,13,"They're not his to take care of. They're
"
,,
3,13,"my kids, and I'm gonna get 'em back.
"
,,
3,13,"My father wasn't there for me,
"
,,
3,13,"but I'll be there for my kids!
"
,,
3,13,"I'm gonna sue your dad for custody!
"
,,
3,13,"Please stop this. Brian has every right
"
,,
3,13,"to see his puppies when they're born.
"
,,
3,13,"Sorry, pumpkin.
"
,,
3,13,"I had no idea you could be so cruel.
"
,,
3,13,"I'll never forgive you for this!
"
,,
3,13," You're just having your period.
"
,,
3,13," This court will now come to order.
"
,,
3,13," Brian, do you like children?
"
,,
3,13," I love children. That's why I'm here.
"
,,
3,13,"I want the opportunity to raise my puppies.
"
,,
3,13,"Do you remember an incident at a South
"
,,
3,13,"Attleboro Denny's in December of 1996?
"
,,
3,13,"Yeah, I guess.
"
,,
3,13,"Waa! Waa! You like that, huh?!
"
,,
3,13,"You like that?! Waa!
"
,,
3,13,"You just tune this out, don't you?!
"
,,
3,13,"Waa! Well, tune this out! Waa!
"
,,
3,13," Aah...
"
,,
3,13," Waa!
"
,,
3,13," Aah...
"
,,
3,13," Waa!
"
,,
3,13," Aah...
"
,,
3,13," Shut up!
"
,,
3,13,"I was angry because my Moon Over
"
,,
3,13,"My Hammy was overcooked and...
"
,,
3,13,"I also have your rental records
"
,,
3,13,"from the Quahog Video Store.
"
,,
3,13," Can you read the last two titles?
"
,,
3,13," Son In Law and Bio-Dome.
"
,,
3,13," And who's the star of those films?
"
,,
3,13," Pauly Shore.
"
,,
3,13,"Pauly Shore!
"
,,
3,13,"He's terrible.
"
,,
3,13,"I rented those for Peter. He got banned
"
,,
3,13,"from the store for taping over movies.
"
,,
3,13,"Rosebud.
"
,,
3,13,"It's his sled. It was his sled
"
,,
3,13,"from when he was a kid.
"
,,
3,13,"There, I just saved you
"
,,
3,13,"two long boobless hours.
"
,,
3,13,"How convenient. Blame it on someone else.
"
,,
3,13,"Is that the man we want
"
,,
3,13,"raising these puppies?
"
,,
3,13,"Peter? Oh, you've gotta
"
,,
3,13,"believe me, Your Honour.
"
,,
3,13,"Peter, I'm putting together
"
,,
3,13,"another card game. You in?
"
,,
3,13," You... you want me to play?
"
,,
3,13," Absolutely.
"
,,
3,13,"But first I want you to testify
"
,,
3,13,"against that horny mutt of yours.
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, I don't know if I can do that.
"
,,
3,13,"That's too bad, because Bill and Michael
"
,,
3,13,"want to see you again.
"
,,
3,13,"Bill's going to bring his Stretch Armstrong.
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, man, and his arms
"
,,
3,13,"stretch out to next week!
"
,,
3,13,"Your Honour, Peter Griffin
"
,,
3,13,"would like to take the stand.
"
,,
3,13,"Mr Griffin, which of the following two
"
,,
3,13,"phrases best describes Brian Griffin?
"
,,
3,13,"Problem drinker,
"
,,
3,13,"or African-American haberdasher?
"
,,
3,13," I guess problem drinker, but that's...
"
,,
3,13," Thank you.
"
,,
3,13,"Sexual deviant, or magic picture that if you
"
,,
3,13,"stare at it long enough, you see something?
"
,,
3,13," Sexual deviant, but that one's not...
"
,,
3,13," Thank you.
"
,,
3,13,"Now, isn't it true that you told my client
"
,,
3,13,"that Brian is a menace to society
"
,,
3,13,"and should never be allowed
"
,,
3,13,"to see his children?
"
,,
3,13,"Um... Uh...
"
,,
3,13,"Brian should be allowed to see his puppies!
"
,,
3,13," Peter, think about what you're doing.
"
,,
3,13," I am. Your Honour, Brian'll be a great dad.
"
,,
3,13,"If I was half the parent he is,
"
,,
3,13,"I'd know Chris's favourite ice cream is...
"
,,
3,13," Chocolate-chip.
"
,,
3,13," Stewie's favourite bedtime story is...
"
,,
3,13," Goodnight, Moon.
"
,,
3,13," Meg's real father's name is...
"
,,
3,13,"Stan Thompson.
"
,,
3,13,"I've heard enough. I do believe
"
,,
3,13,"that Brian would be a successful parent.
"
,,
3,13,"If he was to repeat his actions, he would
"
,,
3,13,"be setting a bad example for his puppies.
"
,,
3,13,"Therefore, I grant Brian custody
"
,,
3,13,"with the condition that he be neutered first.
"
,,
3,13,"Yeah! You did it, buddy! Oh, congratulations!
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, man! What does ""neutered"" mean?
"
,,
3,13,"You're almost there, Sea Breeze.
"
,,
3,13,"Oh, and also, I didn't bring this up before,
"
,,
3,13,"but promise me you won't eat any of them.
"
,,
3,13,"This is like a Greek tragedy where a man
"
,,
3,13,"chooses between himself and his children.
"
,,
3,13,"Of course, you'll be playing
"
,,
3,13,"the role of ""Sans Testiclese"".
"
,,
3,13,"We're ready for you down the hall.
"
,,
3,13,"Sure you want to go through with this?
"
,,
3,13,"You could have puppies with another dog.
"
,,
3,13,"And maybe with a condor!
"
,,
3,13,"Yeah, then you'd have flying puppies.
"
,,
3,13,"Would you like that, Brian?
"
,,
3,13,"Huh? Flying puppies?
"
,,
3,13,"No. Those puppies in there are mine.
"
,,
3,13,"And I'll give anything
"
,,
3,13,"to be with them. Anything.
"
,,
3,13,"I am not looking forward to what you're
"
,,
3,13,"gonna be like once they do this to you.
"
,,
3,13,"Mmm. I love chocolate.
"
,,
3,13,"But I can't eat it because then I'll get fat.
"
,,
3,13,"But it's so good!
"
,,
3,13," Are you ready, Brian?
"
,,
3,13," I guess so.
"
,,
3,13,"Stop! Brian, come quick!
"
,,
3,13," Oh, my God! Those aren't my puppies!
"
,,
3,13," Then whose are they?
"
,,
3,13,"You! You're a whore! A filthy, filthy whore!
"
,,
3,13,"You must be so relieved.
"
,,
3,13,"Actually, I... I was kind of
"
,,
3,13,"looking forward to being a dad.
"
,,
3,13,"Don't worry. There'll be other chances.
"
,,
3,13,"Hey, you know what's funny?
"
,,
3,13,"I always thought that dogs... laid eggs.
"

"
,,
3,14," Because you don't have a bottom, son.
"
,,
3,14," Man, you and that towel are representin'.
"
,,
3,14," Yo, that's what's just fightin', G!
"
,,
3,14,"The Buddy Cianci
"
,,
3,14,"Junior High cheerleaders!
"
,,
3,14,"Is everybody pumped up?
"
,,
3,14,"Give me a D-U-S-T!
"
,,
3,14,"D-U-S-T!
"
,,
3,14,"M-I-T-E-S!
"
,,
3,14,"M-I-T-E-S!
"
,,
3,14," What does that spell?
"
,,
3,14," Dust Mites!
"
,,
3,14," Who's gonna win this game?
"
,,
3,14," Dust Mites!
"
,,
3,14,"My God, what... what just happened to me?
"
,,
3,14,"It's those sirens. They had us all
"
,,
3,14,"completely under their spell.
"
,,
3,14,"Like that hypnotist at the airport Hilton.
"
,,
3,14,"And... three!
"
,,
3,14," Wow. Were we just hypnotised?
"
,,
3,14," That's incredible. I don't remember a thing.
"
,,
3,14,"Why do I taste crotch?
"
,,
3,14,"I must unlock the secret to
"
,,
3,14,"their mind-control powers.
"
,,
3,14," Can we go now? I'm starvin'.
"
,,
3,14," The game's almost over.
"
,,
3,14,"Try to think about somethin' else.
"
,,
3,14,"Ahhhhh...!
"
,,
3,14," Peter!
"
,,
3,14," Sorry.
"
,,
3,14,"Nice job tonight, Chris.
"
,,
3,14,"You wiped the floor with that towel.
"
,,
3,14,"Yo, did y'all check me when
"
,,
3,14,"that hottie was all up in my Kool-Aid?
"
,,
3,14,"I was lookin' to break off somethin',
"
,,
3,14,"but my crew gave me the 411 on that skank
"
,,
3,14,"and she's all about the bling-bling.
"
,,
3,14," What's wrong?
"
,,
3,14," He's speaking in tongues. He's possessed.
"
,,
3,14,"Meg, start at Psalm 41. Don't stop readin' till
"
,,
3,14,"I tell you. The power of Christ compels you!
"
,,
3,14," Agh! Agh! Agh!
"
,,
3,14," The power of Christ compels you!
"
,,
3,14,"Stop. He's not possessed.
"
,,
3,14,"He's just talking street. Lots of kids do it.
"
,,
3,14,"Oh. Well, that's kinda weird.
"
,,
3,14,"It's just a phase.
"
,,
3,14,"You've gone through a few yourself.
"
,,
3,14,"Like those two weeks
"
,,
3,14,"you spent narrating your life.
"
,,
3,14,"I walked into the kitchen and sat at the table.
"
,,
3,14,"I grimaced at the questionable meal
"
,,
3,14,"Lois had placed in front of me.
"
,,
3,14,"I'd never tell her how disgusted I was with
"
,,
3,14,"her cooking, but somehow I think she knew.
"
,,
3,14,"Lois had always been full of energy and life,
"
,,
3,14,"but lately I had grown aware of her ageing.
"
,,
3,14,"The bright, exuberant eyes
"
,,
3,14,"I had fallen in love with
"
,,
3,14,"were growing dull and listless
"
,,
3,14,"with the long fatigue of a weary life.
"
,,
3,14,"I awoke several hours later in a daze.
"
,,
3,14,"""I was brought up on the streets,
"
,,
3,14,"no moms and dads
"
,,
3,14,"""I had to fend for myself
"
,,
3,14,"with my own two hands
"
,,
3,14,"""But today I'm hurtin', and I'll tell you why
"
,,
3,14,"""I got a hangnail
"
,,
3,14,"hangin' from my cuticle
"
,,
3,14,"""A hangnail
"
,,
3,14,"It ain't beautiful
"
,,
3,14,"""It hurts like a bitch that I did last night
"
,,
3,14," Hey, what ya doin'?
"
,,
3,14," Just layin' back in the cot,
"
,,
3,14,"peepin' at this here homey.
"
,,
3,14,"Yo, Pops, gimme some cheddar.
"
,,
3,14,"Some player-haters be throwin' salt
"
,,
3,14,"in my game, grillin' me over my gear.
"
,,
3,14,"And I needs to be mackin' style.
"
,,
3,14,"Well, uh, the important thing is you tried,
"
,,
3,14,"son.
"
,,
3,14,"There they are. And now to infiltrate this
"
,,
3,14,"coven and learn their mind-control secrets.
"
,,
3,14," I just need to get their attention.
"
,,
3,14," OK. That was much better.
"
,,
3,14,"But it still sucked worse than ever.
"
,,
3,14,"What's wrong with you guys?
"
,,
3,14," Look how cute he is!
"
,,
3,14," He must be one of the teachers' babies.
"
,,
3,14,"He wants to be a cheerleader too.
"
,,
3,14,"My! So it's that easy to win you over.
"
,,
3,14,"Consider yourselves lucky
"
,,
3,14,"I'm not after your gully holes.
"
,,
3,14,"Chris starts with all this ""Yo, yo, yo"" stuff,
"
,,
3,14,"and I don't know what he's talkin' about.
"
,,
3,14,"So I started beatin' him with a hose.
"
,,
3,14,"Then my arm got tired, so I came here.
"
,,
3,14,"Perhaps Chris has adopted
"
,,
3,14,"another culture's mannerisms
"
,,
3,14,"because he doesn't know
"
,,
3,14,"enough about his own.
"
,,
3,14,"I never thought of that. I should
"
,,
3,14,"teach Chris about his Irish roots.
"
,,
3,14,"We haven't spent time together
"
,,
3,14,"since we played Operation.
"
,,
3,14," I'm going for the funny bone, Dad.
"
,,
3,14," Oh! You touched the sides!
"
,,
3,14,"He's wakin' up. Get him
"
,,
3,14,"back to the bus station.
"
,,
3,14,"Dad, I don't wanna be here.
"
,,
3,14,"I wanna be chillin' with my homeys.
"
,,
3,14,"Now, Chris, it's important
"
,,
3,14,"you learn about your Irish heritage.
"
,,
3,14,"Archaeological evidence shows Ireland was
"
,,
3,14,"very different before the discovery of alcohol.
"
,,
3,14,"Most experts believe
"
,,
3,14,"it was something like this.
"
,,
3,14,"Gentlemen, today we, Ireland's top scientists,
"
,,
3,14,"have found a way to convert our
"
,,
3,14,"entire population to pure energy.
"
,,
3,14," It's a glorious day.
"
,,
3,14," Absolutely.
"
,,
3,14,"Hey, Michael McCloud's just
"
,,
3,14,"invented a new kind of beverage.
"
,,
3,14,"Hm. ""Whiskey. ""
"
,,
3,14,"You were right, Dad. Bein' Irish rocks!
"
,,
3,14,"That's more like it, son. Today we're gonna
"
,,
3,14,"learn about the Griffin family history.
"
,,
3,14,"What's a library, Dad?
"
,,
3,14,"It's just a place where homeless people
"
,,
3,14,"come to shave and go BM. Let's go inside.
"
,,
3,14,"Look, Dad. I found
"
,,
3,14,"this book on our genealogy.
"
,,
3,14,"Way to go, son. Here's a picture of
"
,,
3,14,"your great-great-granddad, Osias Griffin.
"
,,
3,14,"He owned one of the first dozen telephones.
"
,,
3,14," Hello?
"
,,
3,14," Hello, Jonathan?
"
,,
3,14," No. What number are you callin'?
"
,,
3,14," Seven.
"
,,
3,14," This is three.
"
,,
3,14," Oh. Sorry.
"
,,
3,14,"And his great-grandpa was
"
,,
3,14,"Thomas Griffin, a great philosopher.
"
,,
3,14,"Thomas, would you please go look for a job?
"
,,
3,14,"Why?
"
,,
3,14,"Wow! That's cool! Go back even further, Dad.
"
,,
3,14,"OK. Settle down, spaz.
"
,,
3,14,"In 1840, Nathaniel ""Nate"" Griffin
"
,,
3,14,"used to groom horses. What the hell...?
"
,,
3,14,"Holy crap, I'm black!
"
,,
3,14,"But I-I can't be black.
"
,,
3,14,"I gotta say, the man in this book
"
,,
3,14,"does look an awful lot like you.
"
,,
3,14,"The Diary of Nate Griffin.
"
,,
3,14,"""May 7th, 1836.""
"
,,
3,14,"""I was brushing down Lucy, the new colt,
"
,,
3,14,"when she let out a fart right near my face. ""
"
,,
3,14,"""So I took her head and stuck it by my butt
"
,,
3,14,"and blew a huge fart right back at her. ""
"
,,
3,14,"That laugh's in here, too. See?
"
,,
3,14,"Wow. Then it's true.
"
,,
3,14,"Cool! I get to be black and Irish.
"
,,
3,14,"Now I can wear clothes that
"
,,
3,14,"actually show off my big butt.
"
,,
3,14,"I gotta tell Bonnie
"
,,
3,14,"I'm sleeping with a black man!
"
,,
3,14,"Oh, my God! Update! Exclam!
"
,,
3,14,"Scott Martin just asked me out again!
"
,,
3,14,"Oh, my God. This is date three.
"
,,
3,14,"Are you gonna let him get to second base?
"
,,
3,14,"I think that would be a bad idea.
"
,,
3,14,"And I know something about bad ideas.
"
,,
3,14,"I'm telling you, Juice,
"
,,
3,14,"she's screwin' around behind your back.
"
,,
3,14,"And if I were in your Bruno Maglis,
"
,,
3,14,"I wouldn't stand for it.
"
,,
3,14,"Another mai tai. Thanks.
"
,,
3,14,"So, listen...
"
,,
3,14," Here comes Scott!
"
,,
3,14," Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,14,"Have yet to discover the secret
"
,,
3,14,"of their mind-control powers.
"
,,
3,14,"Also trying to comprehend their obsession
"
,,
3,14,"with the homosexuals from *NS YNC.
"
,,
3,14,"Cleveland, you got a minute?
"
,,
3,14,"I really need to talk to you.
"
,,
3,14,"Sure. I was just goin' for a ride. Hop on.
"
,,
3,14," I've found out I have a black ancestor.
"
,,
3,14," Is that right? That's fantastic, Peter.
"
,,
3,14,"Yeah, but the problem is,
"
,,
3,14,"I got no idea how to be black.
"
,,
3,14,"Except for not smilin'
"
,,
3,14,"when I get my picture taken.
"
,,
3,14,"Well, you should go out and commingle
"
,,
3,14,"amongst your newly found brethren.
"
,,
3,14,"You know, absorb the culture.
"
,,
3,14," Wheelie time! Yee-hah!
"
,,
3,14," Aaargh!
"
,,
3,14,"You're right. I should be hangin' around
"
,,
3,14,"more black people like myself. Thanks.
"
,,
3,14," Hey! Peter, what the...?
"
,,
3,14," It's the vibration.
"
,,
3,14,"Who here used to wear a lot of Jheri Curl?
"
,,
3,14,"Yeah, that's right. Y'all know that Exxon
"
,,
3,14,"Valdez thing? That ain't how it happened.
"
,,
3,14,"Some brother just fell in the ocean!
"
,,
3,14,"God, I remember that. All those seals died.
"
,,
3,14,"It was... it was all over the news.
"
,,
3,14,"The... the Channel Two news with Dan Rather.
"
,,
3,14,"Although I think Connie Chung might've
"
,,
3,14,"been substituting for him that night.
"
,,
3,14,"Well, 'bout time for me to be
"
,,
3,14,"hittin' the old dusty trail.
"
,,
3,14,"I like your hat.
"
,,
3,14,"Can't get out that way.
"
,,
3,14,"Oh. Found the emergency exit.
"
,,
3,14,"was named to the Supreme Court of the US.
"
,,
3,14,"Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
"
,,
3,14,"Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
"
,,
3,14,"Well, I should probably be saddlin' up now.
"
,,
3,14,"Oh. Found the fire door.
"
,,
3,14,"Urgh! Look at how fat you are.
"
,,
3,14,"You disgust me. Oink, oink, fatty.
"
,,
3,14,"You'll take butter on that
"
,,
3,14,"English muffin, won't you?
"
,,
3,14,"You're the cheerleading squad's token blimp!
"
,,
3,14,"You don't deserve to eat!
"
,,
3,14,"Thanks for bringin' me here.
"
,,
3,14,"Welcome. For our first order of business,
"
,,
3,14,"Cleveland has an announcement.
"
,,
3,14,"Yesterday I received reparations
"
,,
3,14,"from the family that enslaved my ancestors.
"
,,
3,14,"Amen!
"
,,
3,14,"The family has become poor white trash since
"
,,
3,14,"then, so they only gave what they could.
"
,,
3,14,"This tray of scrumptious Rice Krispie treats.
"
,,
3,14,"I share them with all of you in the hopes that
"
,,
3,14,"one day your wounds may be healed as well.
"
,,
3,14," Amen!
"
,,
3,14," Right on!
"
,,
3,14," Hey, why is he taking one?
"
,,
3,14," This is my friend Peter Griffin.
"
,,
3,14,"He recently discovered he was black.
"
,,
3,14,"He doesn't look very black to me.
"
,,
3,14,"Gentlemen, please. Please.
"
,,
3,14,"Judge me not by the colour of my skin.
"
,,
3,14,"For I have always been there with you.
"
,,
3,14,"I was there when George and Weezy
"
,,
3,14,"moved on up to the East Side.
"
,,
3,14,"Oh! Oh! Hallelujah! Those were happy times!
"
,,
3,14,"But... but... but I was also
"
,,
3,14,"there for the bad times.
"
,,
3,14,"When Florida lost James to that
"
,,
3,14,"tragic auto accident. Oh! Oh!
"
,,
3,14,"And I was there when Tootie got
"
,,
3,14,"those terribly painful braces. Oh, yes.
"
,,
3,14,"And when Arnold Jackson got
"
,,
3,14,"beat up by the Gooch, I was there.
"
,,
3,14,"So before you decide that I don't belong here,
"
,,
3,14,"remember this: I was there!
"
,,
3,14,"Way to go, Peter! You tell it like it is!
"
,,
3,14,"Now, Chris, what's the secret to happiness?
"
,,
3,14," Money!
"
,,
3,14," Very good. Babs, give him a caramel.
"
,,
3,14,"Hey. Hey, Lois, what are
"
,,
3,14,"your parents doin' here?
"
,,
3,14,"They surprised us with a visit after
"
,,
3,14,"I told them about your recent discovery.
"
,,
3,14,"Yes. Peter, we hear you're a Negro now.
"
,,
3,14,"Yep. I even got my own posse. Big Dog,
"
,,
3,14,"T-Bone, Shades, go make some sandwiches.
"
,,
3,14," We'll hook up later.
"
,,
3,14," My jacket's in there. Please don't write on it.
"
,,
3,14,"I think Chris and Meg should know
"
,,
3,14,"the Pewterschmidt side of their ancestry too.
"
,,
3,14,"Did you know the Pewterschmidts
"
,,
3,14,"were among the first colonists?
"
,,
3,14,"Now, kids, don't be taken in
"
,,
3,14,"by the man. Stay black and proud.
"
,,
3,14,"Here's Silas Pewterschmidt
"
,,
3,14,"bartering with some local Indians.
"
,,
3,14," Cool!
"
,,
3,14," Here's a picture of...
"
,,
3,14," Oh. Never mind that one.
"
,,
3,14," What was that?
"
,,
3,14,"Nothing. Just some fellow we fed and took
"
,,
3,14,"care of in exchange for doing a few chores.
"
,,
3,14,"You mean a slave! Let me see that!
"
,,
3,14,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,14,"It's Nate Griffin!
"
,,
3,14,"Well... 'bout time for me to be
"
,,
3,14,"hittin' the old dusty trail.
"
,,
3,14,"Lois, your family owned my family!
"
,,
3,14," Daddy, is that true?
"
,,
3,14," It appears so. Boy, this is embarrassing.
"
,,
3,14," Yes, it is. And don't call me ""boy""!
"
,,
3,14," Peter! Please, calm down.
"
,,
3,14,"Babs, it's time we went to bed.
"
,,
3,14,"Things'll look better tomorrow.
"
,,
3,14,"Come here, kids. Give Grandma
"
,,
3,14,"and Grandpa a kiss good night.
"
,,
3,14,"Whoa!
"
,,
3,14,"Argh!
"
,,
3,14,"You can whip me all you like, white devil,
"
,,
3,14,"but you'll never break my spirit!
"
,,
3,14,"There must be some clue to the source
"
,,
3,14,"of their mental manipulation techniques.
"
,,
3,14,"Your Body and You.
"
,,
3,14,"""Every four weeks, it's entirely normal
"
,,
3,14,"for every young woman to... ""
"
,,
3,14,"Oh, my God! Oh! That's the most
"
,,
3,14,"disgusting thing I've ever heard in my life!
"
,,
3,14,"Ugh!
"
,,
3,14,"That totally sucked! You guys
"
,,
3,14,"call yourselves cheerleaders?
"
,,
3,14,"Well, I call you cheer-losers!
"
,,
3,14,"Cindi is definitely the alpha of the group.
"
,,
3,14,"And what happened with the pyramid?
"
,,
3,14,"I almost broke my neck!
"
,,
3,14,"The pyramid. Of course!
"
,,
3,14,"That must be the key to their power.
"
,,
3,14,"Mission objective: Eliminate Cindi and take
"
,,
3,14,"her place at the top of the pyramid.
"
,,
3,14,"They're getting nude! I mustn't watch.
"
,,
3,14,"It's not the proper thing... Whoa!
"
,,
3,14,"I say! Nice ones, Jeanine.
"
,,
3,14,"And look at Lisa in all of
"
,,
3,14,"her curvaceous glory.
"
,,
3,14,"It appears my wee-wee has been
"
,,
3,14,"stricken with rigor mortis.
"
,,
3,14," Good mornin'.
"
,,
3,14," Peter, what on earth are you wearing?
"
,,
3,14,"It's a dashiki. And don't call me Peter. That's
"
,,
3,14,"my slave name. Call me Kichwa Tembo.
"
,,
3,14,"Cool! And I'll be Mambuto O'Malley.
"
,,
3,14," Peter...
"
,,
3,14," Kichwa!
"
,,
3,14,"I'd like to have a word with you.
"
,,
3,14," Peter, I think...
"
,,
3,14," Kichwa!
"
,,
3,14,"Kichwa, we're both sensible men.
"
,,
3,14,"There must be something
"
,,
3,14,"I can do to make it right.
"
,,
3,14,"Actually there is. I want reparations,
"
,,
3,14,"just like Cleveland got.
"
,,
3,14," What are you talking about?
"
,,
3,14," I want an apology and Rice Krispie treats.
"
,,
3,14,"I will not give you an apology,
"
,,
3,14,"and I assume ""Rice Krispie treats"" is
"
,,
3,14,"black slang for money, so here's $10,000.
"
,,
3,14,"I expect you never to mention
"
,,
3,14,"this ugly business again.
"
,,
3,14,"$10,000?
"
,,
3,14,"Not enough? Make it 20.
"
,,
3,14,"How do you spell ""Kichwa""?
"
,,
3,14,"Screw the ""Kichwa"".
"
,,
3,14,"Make it out to ""Peter"", P-E-T-E...
"
,,
3,14,"This just in: Slave-owner descendant
"
,,
3,14,"Carter Pewterschmidt has paid $20,000,
"
,,
3,14,"or two million pennies,
"
,,
3,14,"in reparations to a local black man.
"
,,
3,14,"We now go live to the local black man.
"
,,
3,14,"Well, the money helps, but I'll
"
,,
3,14,"always feel my ancestor's pain.
"
,,
3,14,"Hey, from down there, does it look like

3,14,"I'm talking into a bunch of robot penises?
"
,,
3,14,"Lois, come and see what I did
"
,,
3,14,"with the money your dad gave me.
"
,,
3,14,"Oh, my God! You turned the den
"
,,
3,14,"into Pee-wee's Playhouse?
"
,,
3,14,"""Come on, get up
"
,,
3,14,"""Knock off your nappin'

,,
3,14,"""It's a crazy, messed-up place

3,14,"where anything can happen
"
,,
3,14,"""There's a chair that freakin' talks
"
,,
3,14,"""There's some fish that give advice

3,14,"Holy crap!

"
,,
3,14," Peter...
"

3,14," Watch this. Watch this. Hey, Jambi!
"
,,
3,14," OK, say it.
"
,,
3,14," Mekka lekka hi... God, I hate you so much.
"
,,
3,14,"That reparation money
"
,,
3,14,"should be going to a black charity.
"
,,
3,14,"The king of cartoons will be here in five
"
,,
3,14,"minutes, and I won't have you embarrass me.
"
,,
3,14,"You're acting ridiculous.
"
,,
3,14,"You said the secret word!
"
,,
3,14,"Uh-oh.
"
,,
3,14," Hey, you're that black guy I saw on the
"
,,
3,14,"news. - Uh, yeah, that's me.
"
,,
3,14," I need backup. I've got a stolen vehicle here.
"
,,
3,14," But this is my car.
"
,,
3,14,"Suspect's getting belligerent. Officer down.
"
,,
3,14,"So it's agreed: We'll keep on pretending to
"
,,
3,14,"like pigs' feet just to confound the white man.
"
,,
3,14,"Uh, sorry I'm late, you guys.
"
,,
3,14,"The white man was makin' me his bitch.
"
,,
3,14,"What? Oh, sorry. His be-atch.
"
,,
3,14,"Peter, we know about your selfish
"
,,
3,14,"squandering of your reparation money.
"
,,
3,14,"I shared mine. You, however, have
"
,,
3,14,"given nothin' back to the community.
"
,,
3,14,"But... that's not true.
"
,,
3,14,"I've brought you the greatest gift of all.
"
,,
3,14,"A child's laughter.
"
,,
3,14," Peter, I think you should go.
"
,,
3,14," Yeah, I'm going.
"
,,
3,14,"Hi, guys.
"
,,
3,14,"Uh, hey, how's it goin'?
"
,,
3,14,"No one wants to sit with me.
"
,,
3,14,"It's like I'm a freakin' leper.
"
,,
3,14," Hey, can we sit there?
"
,,
3,14," No, these are saved.
"
,,
3,14," Where is Cindi?
"
,,
3,14," She'd better show up. It's almost half-time.
"
,,
3,14,"Cindi, I'd feel worse about this if you didn't
"
,,
3,14,"spell your name with that insufferable i.
"
,,
3,14,"Oh, and that cockadoodie smiley face
"
,,
3,14,"you use to dot it. You sicken me!
"
,,
3,14,"I'm not gonna hurt you.
"
,,
3,14," Agh!
"
,,
3,14," Hello, Peter.
"
,,
3,14,"Nate Griffin. Oh, my God, you're haunting me
"
,,
3,14,"because I've been a terrible black man.
"
,,
3,14,"You gotta stop puttin'
"
,,
3,14,"so much importance on race.
"
,,
3,14," I didn't.
"
,,
3,14," You didn't?
"
,,
3,14,"No. If I had, would I have slept with
"
,,
3,14,"your white great-great-great-great-granny?
"
,,
3,14," I guess not.
"
,,
3,14," I wouldn't have slept with her sister, neither.
"
,,
3,14,"You see, Peter, the most important thing is
"
,,
3,14,"how a man acts. You see what I'm gettin' at?
"
,,
3,14,"You think I should do something good
"
,,
3,14,"with that reparation money.
"
,,
3,14," That'd be mighty fine, Peter.
"
,,
3,14," I guess you're right.
"
,,
3,14,"For what it's worth, I'm sorry my wife's
"
,,
3,14,"ancestors made you suffer so much.
"
,,
3,14,"Don't worry about me. If it makes you feel
"
,,
3,14,"better, I peed in their cereal every morning.
"
,,
3,14," Well, so long, Peter.
"
,,
3,14," Wait. Before you go, what's heaven like?
"
,,
3,14,"Oh, it's fine. There's a shortage of chairs.
"
,,
3,14,"Oh.
"
,,
3,14,"Yeah.
"
,,
3,14,"Take it easy, Peter.
"
,,
3,14,"Look, we're just going to
"
,,
3,14,"have to go on without her.
"
,,
3,14," Give me a D!
"
,,
3,14," D!
"
,,
3,14,"That's enough of that. There's a hunting knife
"
,,
3,14,"under your seats. On my command... Argh!
"
,,
3,14,"Argh! You idiots! I had them!
"
,,
3,14,"Cindi was right. We need a lot more work.
"
,,
3,14,"Uh, excuse me. Yeah.
"
,,
3,14,"Uh, hi. I'm Peter Griffin.
"
,,
3,14,"Listen, uh, as many of you may know,
"
,,
3,14,"I recently came into some money.
"
,,
3,14,"Well, I don't really deserve it.
"
,,
3,14,"So I've decided to share it with my brothers!
"
,,
3,14,"Uh... Actually, I just meant the black guys.
"
,,
3,14,"That was very generous.
"
,,
3,14,"Look how happy you've made everyone.
"
,,
3,14,"It just goes to show you, Lois,
"
,,
3,14,"it doesn't matter if you're black or white.
"
,,
3,14," The only colour that really matters is green.
"
,,
3,14," Oh, Peter!

3,14,"I wonder what happened to Cindi.

3,15,"to raise money for an organ transplant
"

3,15," What do you call this device, Paul?

3,15," An iron lung. It keeps me from dying.

"

3,15," Hi, sweetheart.
"

3,15,"So you want the full wash... Oh, you've got a

3,15,"If you want to go with a scent, I've got
"

3,15,"PB and J, Sugar Cereal, and New Toy.
"

3,15,"What the deuce?
"

3,15," Hey! Somebody dropped a money clip.
"
,,
3,15," Wow! $26.
"
,,
3,15," I've never seen so much money at one time.
"
,,
3,15," What should we do with it?
"
,,
3,15,"I say we buy 26 dollars' worth

3,15,"of ice cream and just pig out.

3,15,"We can dish, talk about who's getting fat.
"

3,15,"We'll be great big bitches.

3,15,"Hold on, kids. That's not your money yet.
"

3,15,"You gotta put up signs and wait

3,15,"If no one does, it's yours.

3,15," The Matrix?
"
,,
3,15," No. They were jumping out of a plane.

3,15," Joe, what happened?
"

3,15," I got the money.
"

3,15," All right, Joe!

3,15," But I lost the perp.
"
,,
3,15,"Well, the money's the important thing.
"

3,15,"Now Paul can get his...

3,15,"I lost the perp!

3,15,"would probably be safe in my room.

3,15,"Right. Probably get lost among the pin-ups

3,15,"Blast! Who the devil do the teenagers like?
"
,,
3,15,"Morgan Freeman.
"
,,
3,15,"We can't keep it in my room cos there's
"

3,15,"an evil monkey that lives in my closet.
"
,,
3,15,"The sad part is, he wasn't always evil.
"

3,15,"Honey, good news! I made partner!
"

3,15,"Peter, Bonnie says Joe's really
"

3,15,"depressed about that robbery.
"
,,
3,15," Why don't you go talk to him?
"
,,
3,15," I don't know. There's a game on.
"

3,15,"Shame on you. You march over there

3,15,"and cheer your old friend up.

3,15,"the first time I've ever lost a perp.
"
,,
3,15,"It was also the first time
"
,,
3,15,"I've really felt handicapped.
"
,,
3,15,"I've made up my mind about this.
"
,,
3,15,"I'm quitting the force.
"
,,
3,15,"Come on, Joe.
"
,,
3,15,"You don't have to quit the force.
"
,,
3,15,"You could get a desk job. Huh?
"
,,
3,15," You could be a desk.
"
,,
3,15," Forget it. I'm washed up.

3,15,"You really think I can?

3,15,"Coming up, our expos on conveniently

3,15," But first, Peter, look out for that skateboard.
"
,,
3,15," Agh!
"
,,
3,15," Had a row with a fellow in the steam room.
"
,,
3,15," You don't say!
"

3,15," Gave him a cauliflower ear.

3,15," Bully!

,,
3,15,"They get big hair faces and
"
,,
3,15,"their breasts become like flapjacks.

3,15," Oh, God, I'm sorry.

3,15,"Aisle three next to the creams.
"
,,
3,15,"Oh, I don't like saying that word.

3,15,"our finest athletes struggle valiantly
"
,,
3,15,"against God's twisted designs. You'll cheer,
"
,,
3,15,"you'll cry. You might get a cheap laugh.
"
,,
3,15,"I know I will, Tom. In fact, by the end
"
,,
3,15,"of the day, we may all be going to hell.
"
,,
3,15,"I'll see you there, Diane.

3,15,"It sounds like the opening

3,15,"And now we turn our attention
"
,,
3,15,"to the lighting of the flame.
"
,,
3,15,"And these games are under way.
"
,,
3,15,"We begin with the 100-metre dash
"
,,
3,15,"for people afraid of yellow tape.
"
,,
3,15,"It's anybody's race now, Tom.
"
,,
3,15,"And it's Odai Mutambo of Kenya!

,,
3,15,"The decathlon.
"
,,
3,15,"That's quite a mountain to climb, Peter.
"
,,
3,15,"Joe, look at me. Look at me!
"
,,
3,15," Do I have food in my teeth?
"
,,
3,15," No.
"
,,
3,15,"Great. Thank God!
"
,,
3,15,"Listen, Joe. You and I both know
"
,,
3,15,"you have what it takes to win this thing.
"
,,
3,15,"So get out there and do it!
"
,,
3,15,"That gold medal is mine,

3,15,"pretty boy. You don't have a chance.
"
,,
3,15," He may be right, Peter.
"
,,
3,15," Joe, he's an android.
"
,,
3,15,"Don't let him push you around.
"
,,
3,15,"You can do this.
"
,,
3,15,"Yeah. Yeah!
"
,,
3,15,"You think you're so hot, fella?
"
,,
3,15,"Well, I can do this.
"

3,15,"Oh, crap.
"
,,
3,15,"Let's do it!
"
,,
3,15,"Now the first decathlon event,
"
,,
3,15,"the pole vault,
"
,,
3,15,"where Joe Swanson
"
,,
3,15,"takes his starting position.
"
,,
3,15," Way to go, Joe!
"
,,
3,15," Yeah!
"
,,
3,15," How do you like that, buddy?
"
,,
3,15," A stinker says ""what"".
"
,,
3,15," What?
"
,,
3,15," Ha, ha, ha, ha. You stupid bastard.
"
,,
3,15,"Good to see your new fiscal responsibilities
"
,,
3,15,"haven't interfered with your reading.
"
,,
3,15,"Ah! Dostoevsky, the mad Russian.
"
,,
3,15,"Good stuff. Good stuff.
"
,,
3,15,"You're not gonna get the $26,
"
,,
3,15,"and you're despicable for trying.
"
,,
3,15,"What? Oh, you thought...
"
,,
3,15,"I wasn't trying to get the $26.
"
,,
3,15,"I thought we were just having
"
,,
3,15,"an innocent conversation about literature.
"
,,
3,15,"Oh, you're silly.
"
,,
3,15,"I love that you'd go there.
"
,,
3,15,"You're silly. Goodbye.
"
,,
3,15,"We'll go to bulimic pie-eating in a moment,
"
,,
3,15,"but first, decathlon frontrunner
"
,,
3,15,"Joe Swanson will attempt the long jump.
"
,,
3,15," Come on, Joe. Break a wheel!
"
,,
3,15," I'm ready. Let's get it on!
"
,,
3,15,"That'll knock him out of the lead.
"
,,
3,15,"Tough break.
"
,,
3,15," Tough break, Tom.
"
,,
3,15," Good contribution, Diane.
"
,,
3,15,"For Swanson to take the gold, he'll have
"
,,
3,15,"to win the final event, the 100-metre dash.
"
,,
3,15," That's OK, Joe. You can still win this thing.
"
,,
3,15," That was pathetic.
"
,,
3,15,"Tell your wife to come over to my place if she
"
,,
3,15,"wants a little boom-lacka-lacka-lacka-lacka.
"
,,
3,15,"Boom-lacka-lacka-lacka-lacka.
"
,,
3,15,"Boom-lacka-lacka-lacka-lacka. Boom.
"
,,
3,15," Peter, it's over.
"
,,
3,15," What are you talkin' about?
"
,,
3,15,"If I couldn't catch a two-bit criminal,
"
,,
3,15,"how can I win a race?
"
,,
3,15,"Hey, what kinda talk is that?
"
,,
3,15,"It's un-American. Did George W Bush quit
"
,,
3,15,"even after losing the popular vote? No.
"
,,
3,15,"Did he quit after losing millions of his father's
"
,,
3,15,"friends' money in failed oil companies? No.
"
,,
3,15,"Did he quit after knockin' that girl up? No.
"
,,
3,15,"Did he quit after he got that DUl? No.
"
,,
3,15,"Did he quit after gettin' arrested for drunk and
"
,,
3,15,"disorderly conduct at a football game? No.
"
,,
3,15,"I get the message, Peter.
"
,,
3,15,"Gee, Peter, this water tastes kinda funny.
"
,,
3,15,"Uh... You mean ha-ha Jerry Seinfeld funny, or
"
,,
3,15,"Elayne Boosler bless-her-she's-trying funny?
"
,,
3,15," Racers, on your mark.
"
,,
3,15," Go get 'em, Joe.
"
,,
3,15,"Get set.
"
,,
3,15," Yeah!
"
,,
3,15," Joe Swanson wins the gold medal.
"
,,
3,15," You did it, Joe
"
,,
3,15," We did it, Peter.
"
,,
3,15,"Mommy, look at the ladyb... Agh!
"
,,
3,15," Hey, speedy.
"
,,
3,15," Do I know you?
"
,,
3,15," Jim Kaplan, sports agent. Like my car?
"
,,
3,15," Yeah.
"
,,
3,15," It's yours. Like my pants?
"
,,
3,15," Sure.
"
,,
3,15," You know what a merkin is?
"
,,
3,15," No.
"
,,
3,15," Pubic wig. I got one. You want it?
"
,,
3,15," No.
"
,,
3,15," Of course you don't. You wanna be rich?
"
,,
3,15," Yes.
"
,,
3,15,"Sign here.
"
,,
3,15,"What the hell...?
"
,,
3,15,"I don't understand why he did that without
"
,,
3,15,"me. We were gonna do everything together.
"
,,
3,15,"It was one cereal ad, Peter.
"
,,
3,15,"Besides, he won the medal.
"
,,
3,15,"Yeah, I guess.
"
,,
3,15,"Coming to ABC, the simple story
"
,,
3,15,"of a man and his chair:
"
,,
3,15,"What is this?!
"
,,
3,15,"Starring Tony Danza as Joe Swanson.
"
,,
3,15,"Once a man at his physical peak,
"
,,
3,15,"brought down by a cruel twist of fate.
"
,,
3,15,"Whyyyyyy?
"
,,
3,15," With Valerie Bertinelli as Bonnie.
"
,,
3,15," Joe, you must accept your limitations.
"
,,
3,15,"Why don't you just ask me
"
,,
3,15,"to lay down and die?
"
,,
3,15,"I can't live like this any more!
"
,,
3,15,"That's it!
"
,,
3,15," That's not how it happened. It was my idea.
"
,,
3,15," With Bea Arthur as Peter Griffin.
"
,,
3,15,"You'll never make it, Joe.
"
,,
3,15,"Why don't you just give up right now?
"
,,
3,15,"No. I've got to try.
"
,,
3,15," Even if it's by myself.
"
,,
3,15," You're a fool, Joe. A fool.
"
,,
3,15,"Friday on ABC, followed by ""Dharma
"
,,
3,15,"and Greg"", but you don't have to watch that.
"
,,
3,15,"Joe wouldn't be famous if it wasn't for me.
"
,,
3,15,"How come he's gettin' all the glory?
"
,,
3,15,"He's handicapped.
"
,,
3,15,"That makes his story inspirational.
"
,,
3,15,"Handicapped... Hm...
"
,,
3,15,"Agh! How did these get up here?
"
,,
3,15,"What the hell is this, Brian?
"
,,
3,15,"It's my new passport.
"
,,
3,15,"Why are you opening my mail?
"
,,
3,15,"You weren't planning on going somewhere
"
,,
3,15,"with our $26, were you?
"
,,
3,15,"For God's sake, I just had
"
,,
3,15,"the damn thing renewed.
"
,,
3,15,"You're obviously taking us for saps,
"
,,
3,15,"but we're not.
"
,,
3,15,"Fess up or I'll do to you
"
,,
3,15,"what I did to John Lennon.
"
,,
3,15,"John, have you met Yoko? Yoko, John.
"
,,
3,15,"You want your money? Fine.
"
,,
3,15,"I hope you all kill each other.
"
,,
3,15,"All right, I know how to settle this.
"
,,
3,15,"Whoever wants the money, raise your hand.
"
,,
3,15,"Ho-ho. You're smarter than I thought.
"
,,
3,15,"Give yourselves a round of applause.
"
,,
3,15,"Damn!
"
,,
3,15,"Honey, I'm gonna be late tonight.
"
,,
3,15,"I've got a hooker coming over.
"
,,
3,15,"I know it's late notice,
"
,,
3,15,"but what about the pool guy?
"
,,
3,15," Mr Tucker, Mr Griffin's here to see you.
"
,,
3,15," I gotta go.
"
,,
3,15,"Mr Tucker, I have just become
"
,,
3,15,"handicapped like Joe Swanson.
"
,,
3,15,"I demand commercial endorsements
"
,,
3,15,"and a TV movie based on me
"
,,
3,15," starring Valerie Bertinernie.
"
,,
3,15," Mr Griffin...
"
,,
3,15,"I even got the first piece you're gonna run.
"
,,
3,15,"Exclusive footage of my tragic accident.
"
,,
3,15,"Oh, no! A car going too fast
"
,,
3,15,"to stop in time! Aieee!
"
,,
3,15,"Agh! Agh!
"
,,
3,15,"I'm handicapped now. Agh!
"
,,
3,15,"Mr Griffin, you can't expect me to believe this.
"
,,
3,15,"That was clearly a scarecrow in your clothes.
"
,,
3,15," Come on!
"
,,
3,15," And when I freeze-frame,
"
,,
3,15,"you're driving the car.
"
,,
3,15," There's your hook.
"
,,
3,15," Get out.
"
,,
3,15,"Today we're here to honour Joe Swanson
"
,,
3,15,"for pulling my one-eyed cat Bootsie out of
"
,,
3,15,"the old stovepipe of my grandmother's cabin.
"
,,
3,15,"Joe Swanson won the Special People's
"
,,
3,15,"decathlon and we're here to honour him.
"
,,
3,15," Backstabber.
"
,,
3,15," Peter, I'm sure Joe will acknowledge you.
"
,,
3,15,"Don't forget our deal, Lois.
"
,,
3,15,"I sit through this and later tonight I get anal.
"
,,
3,15,"No matter how neat I want the house,
"
,,
3,15,"you clean it.
"
,,
3,15,"Thank you, thank you.
"
,,
3,15,"You know, no one can win
"
,,
3,15,"a gold medal by himself.
"
,,
3,15,"It takes friends. I want to acknowledge
"
,,
3,15,"a special friend in the audience today.
"
,,
3,15,"My friend Peter.
"
,,
3,15,"Peter Yarrow, of Peter, Paul and Mary.
"
,,
3,15,"Let's give him a hand, folks.
"
,,
3,15,"That's nothing compared to
"
,,
3,15,"what this next man did.
"
,,
3,15,"He challenged me to go that extra mile.
"
,,
3,15,"And that man is Mr Griffin.
"
,,
3,15,"Comedian Eddie Griffin, get up here!
"
,,
3,15,"Your acerbic anti-white humour was
"
,,
3,15,"a constant inspiration. Thank you, sir.
"
,,
3,15,"And last but not least,
"
,,
3,15,"who could forget the fat guy?
"
,,
3,15,"Chef Paul Prudhomme,
"
,,
3,15,"you get your Cajun ass up here!
"
,,
3,15,"I didn't even do anything.
"
,,
3,15,"That's it.
"
,,
3,15,"There's someone else he didn't thank.
"
,,
3,15," Mr Steroid. That's how he won.
"
,,
3,15," That's not true.
"
,,
3,15,"Yes, it is. I put steroids in your water bottle
"
,,
3,15,"before the last race.
"
,,
3,15,"I'm sorry, everybody. I've let you all down.
"
,,
3,15,"Yes. You suck. I rule.
"
,,
3,15,"Who da man? Who da man? Who da man?
"
,,
3,15,"All right. If anyone tries to lift the glass,
"
,,
3,15,"the bell will ring.
"
,,
3,15," Well, let's all go to bed.
"
,,
3,15," Off we go, then.
"
,,
3,15," Did you find the place OK?
"
,,
3,15," No problem.
"
,,
3,15,"Hey, kids.
"
,,
3,15,"I only had soup. I don't see why
"
,,
3,15,"we should split the bill evenly.
"
,,
3,15,"Wake up! This is Mr Taylor.
"
,,
3,15,"He's here to claim the money clip.
"
,,
3,15," Oh!
"
,,
3,15," Oh!
"
,,
3,15,"Uuuuuuugh!
"
,,
3,15,"Peter, go talk to him. After all,
"
,,
3,15,"you set out to make him feel better.
"
,,
3,15," Now he's worse than ever.
"
,,
3,15," I don't know, Lois.
"
,,
3,15,"He's probably waitin' to be interviewed
"
,,
3,15,"by Dan Rather or that dreadful Gene Shalit.
"
,,
3,15,"I think those days are over now, Peter.
"
,,
3,15," Hey there.
"
,,
3,15," Hi, Peter.
"
,,
3,15," Listen, Joe, about this whole mess...
"
,,
3,15," Hold it, Peter.
"
,,
3,15,"That's the car-wash thief.
"
,,
3,15," Ha, ha! Tough luck, wheelie!
"
,,
3,15," Yeah. For you.
"
,,
3,15,"I'm Joe, your waiter. Today's special
"
,,
3,15,"is justice, served cold with a side of jail.
"
,,
3,15,"Order the souffl now,
"
,,
3,15,"cos it takes 10 to 15 years.
"
,,
3,15,"Peter, I really appreciate
"
,,
3,15,"what you did for me.
"
,,
3,15," What do you mean?
"
,,
3,15," That slimy agent had me believing the hype.
"
,,
3,15,"I forgot it was really you who got me
"
,,
3,15,"to believe in myself again.
"
,,
3,15," By the way, I'm goin' back to the force.
"
,,
3,15," Good for you.
"
,,
3,15,"What happened to the car-wash thief?
"
,,
3,15,"Ironically, I severed his spine
"
,,
3,15,"when I landed on him.
"
,,
3,15,"Looks like you got more competition
"
,,
3,15,"at next year's games.
"
,,
3,15,"No. He's dead.

3,16,"Oh, Stewie, no sweets before dinner.
"

3,16,"Mom, I'm freezing. Can we go home?
"

3,16,"In a minute. Would you just
"

3,16,"look at this beautiful tree?

3,16,"Come on, honey. It's the only thing
"
,,
3,16,"I've asked you to do. Please?
"
,,
3,16,"Brian, tape this for me.
"

3,16,"The VCR hasn't worked since

3,16,"Do you have the express written consent

3,16,"I got something to add to my Christmas list.
"

3,16,"Those jewelled bug barrettes. Not costume -
"

3,16,"real. Maybe you should write that down.
"
,,
3,16,"Honey, Santa got all his shopping done
"
,,
3,16,"before the rush. I think you'll be very happy.
"
,,
3,16,"I just want peace on Earth.
"

3,16,"That's better than being selfish like Meg,

3,16," Can't we tell them your mother died?
"
,,
3,16," I won't lie about something like that.
"
,,
3,16,"All right, I'll kill your mother. God, when

3,16,"did Christmas become so complicated?
"
,,
3,16," You guys know that Rudolph is on, right?
"
,,
3,16," Peter!
"
,,
3,16,"Thank you for the lovely gingerbread house.
"
,,
3,16,"Yeah! It's perfect for
"

3,16,"all the happy active gingerbread men.

"
,,
3,16," Hi, I'm Prancer.
"
,,
3,16,"Why don't you take Joe along?

3,16,"That'll be about as much fun as
"

3,16,"a lecture on ontological empiricism.
"
,,
3,16," What?
"
,,
3,16," What?
"
,,
3,16,"Honey, he could use some Christmas spirit.
"
,,
3,16," For me? Please?
"
,,
3,16," All right, all right.
"
,,
3,16,"But you owe me. Later, under the mistletoe.
"
,,
3,16,"Open mouth, no matter how drunk I am.
"
,,
3,16,"The gifts are in the trunk. Don't forget
"
,,
3,16,"to drop off the one for Toys for Toddlers.
"
,,
3,16,"All right.
"
,,
3,16," Somebody give me a beer.
"
,,
3,16," Heads up.
"
,,
3,16,"Yeah, Peter, one of us has
"
,,
3,16,"to be the designated driver,
"
,,
3,16,"and I've already had four eggnogs,
"
,,
3,16,"so I guess you're it.
"
,,
3,16,"Ha! That's a good one, Joe.
"
,,
3,16,"Way to get into the spirit.
"
,,
3,16," Oh!
"
,,
3,16," I'm a cop first, a buddy second,
"
,,
3,16,"so don't think I wouldn't throw
"
,,
3,16,"your drunk-driving ass in the slammer!
"
,,
3,16,"All right, let's a-wassail!
"
,,
3,16,"Stewie, honey, time for bed.
"
,,
3,16,"You have a big day tomorrow, Baby Jesus.
"
,,
3,16,"Trust me, if I could walk on water,
"
,,
3,16,"I'd stroll you to a lake and hold you under
"
,,
3,16,"until the bubbles stopped!
"
,,
3,16,"Oh, someone's being naughty, not nice.
"
,,
3,16," You know, Santa's watching you.
"
,,
3,16," What the devil do you mean?
"
,,
3,16,"Honey, Santa's making a list
"
,,
3,16,"and checking it twice.
"
,,
3,16," He sees you when you're sleeping.
"
,,
3,16," He knows when you're awake.
"

3,16,"I almost caught him last year. But he's magic!
"
,,
3,16,"Constant surveillance
"
,,
3,16,"of every child on Earth? Impossible!
"
,,
3,16,"Unless... Hidden cameras!
"
,,
3,16,"Very clever. Watching to see
"
,,
3,16,"if I'm naughty are you?
"
,,
3,16,"Well, check this twice!
"
,,
3,16,"Hey, guys. Check me out.
"
,,
3,16,"Whoa! Whoa!
"
,,
3,16,"Whoa... Agh!
"
,,
3,16,"Whoa. Whoa! Aagh!
"
,,
3,16,"Oh, no! Oh, no! I've broken my legs!
"
,,
3,16,"That's about as funny as Sinbad.
"
,,
3,16,"Not the comedian. He's hilarious.
"
,,
3,16,"The sailor. But then he was
"
,,
3,16,"never meant to be funny.
"
,,
3,16,"I gotta go to freakin' Toys for Toddlers.
"
,,
3,16,"Sounds like somebody's
"
,,
3,16,"got a humbug up his butt.
"
,,
3,16,"Maybe we should set him up
"
,,
3,16,"with another lemon snow cone.
"
,,
3,16,"No, thanks. The last one you gave me
"
,,
3,16,"didn't taste like lemon. It tasted like...
"
,,
3,16,"Oh, you guys are asses!
"
,,
3,16,"I knew you were awake.
"
,,
3,16,"You!
"
,,
3,16,"Now, Stewie, you are in my power.
"
,,
3,16,"Agh! No, damn you!
"
,,
3,16,"Damn you, let me go! Agh!
"
,,
3,16,"Good, Melvin. Nice work, Woodrow.
"
,,
3,16,"Excellent, Stewie.
"
,,
3,16,"Agh!
"
,,
3,16,"It was just a dream. I needn't fear this Santa.
"
,,
3,16,"If he were omnipotent, he'd have
"
,,
3,16,"the fortitude to show himself!
"
,,
3,16,"See? I'm just barking in the dark.
"
,,
3,16,"No one here but me.
"
,,
3,16,"All right, where's the wire?
"
,,
3,16,"Show yourself, Claus!
"
,,
3,16," Stewie, go to sleep!
"
,,
3,16," This doesn't involve you, Lois!
"
,,
3,16," I don't want to have to come in there.
"
,,
3,16," I don't want to have to come in there!
"
,,
3,16,"Shh. Dad's awake.
"
,,
3,16," Don't whisper. I don't have a hangover.
"
,,
3,16," It's a Christmas miracle.
"
,,
3,16,"Shouldn't you have your sweater on?
"
,,
3,16,"That's for letting Joe
"
,,
3,16,"join in your reindeer games.
"
,,
3,16,"Now you go relax while I make my little
"
,,
3,16,"Christmas angel a big stack of pancakes.
"
,,
3,16,"If I'm asleep, just stuff 'em in my mouth.
"
,,
3,16," Just one more thing.
"
,,
3,16," Lois!
"
,,
3,16,"I need you to take the presents
"
,,
3,16,"out of the trunk.
"
,,
3,16," Aren't you gonna do it?
"
,,
3,16," I dropped them all off at Toys for Toddlers.
"
,,
3,16,"All? One gift was for charity.
"
,,
3,16,"The rest were for the family.
"
,,
3,16,"No, the rest were from the family.
"
,,
3,16,"Were... weren't they?
"
,,
3,16,"Oh, crap. Since when did they change
"
,,
3,16,"the meaning of ""for"" to ""from""?
"
,,
3,16," They had a meeting about it last night.
"
,,
3,16," Why wasn't I told?
"
,,
3,16,"They sent you a card, but it said ""for Peter"",
"
,,
3,16,"so you must've thought it was from you,
"
,,
3,16,"so you didn't, uh...
"
,,
3,16,"It's just easier to call you stupid.
"
,,
3,16,"You're gonna take back
"
,,
3,16,"donated gifts on Christmas Eve?
"
,,
3,16,"Yep. Now here's the plan: You'll enter
"
,,
3,16,"through the air conditioning duct here.
"
,,
3,16,"There's a laser grid
"
,,
3,16,"three inches above the floor,
"
,,
3,16,"so you have to compress your body
"
,,
3,16,"to the size of a sponge
"
,,
3,16,"and slide underneath like some
"
,,
3,16,"kind of weird amphibious dolphin.
"
,,
3,16,"Can I buy some pot from you?
"
,,
3,16," What you want?
"
,,
3,16," Oh!
"
,,
3,16,"So you understand, all these gifts
"
,,
3,16,"were supposed to be for my family.
"
,,
3,16,"It was just some crazy mix-up.
"
,,
3,16,"Kill 'em.
"
,,
3,16,"No, no, no, it's true.
"
,,
3,16,"That remote control car was for my son.
"
,,
3,16,"And those barrettes were for my daughter,
"
,,
3,16,"and... Where's my VCR?
"
,,
3,16,"Dang it, Buck!
"
,,
3,16,"It's my turn to use the sexbox!
"
,,
3,16,"It's my sexbox! And her name is Sony.
"
,,
3,16,"You gave away all the presents?
"
,,
3,16,"If you strike me down, I shall become more
"
,,
3,16,"powerful than you can possibly imagine.
"
,,
3,16,"You brought glad tidings to
"
,,
3,16,"a family less fortunate than your own.
"
,,
3,16,"You're not mad?
"
,,
3,16,"I am a bit irritated that I have to shop again.
"
,,
3,16,"But at least some good came out of it.
"
,,
3,16,"So I can drink beer and watch TV?
"
,,
3,16,"Because Kiss Saves Santa is on.
"
,,
3,16,"But, Mrs Claus, who would kidnap Santa?
"
,,
3,16,"Ace, that's what I want you boys to find out.
"
,,
3,16,"Someone stole Santa? That does not rock!
"
,,
3,16,"Easy, Gene. Guys, let's go save Christmas.
"
,,
3,16," To the Kisscopter!
"
,,
3,16," Yay!
"
,,
3,16,"You can watch all the TV you want...
"
,,
3,16,"just as soon as we get back from the mall.
"
,,
3,16,"The mall? On Christmas Eve?
"
,,
3,16,"I just want this family
"
,,
3,16,"to have a perfect Christmas.
"
,,
3,16,"And I need a little help, OK?
"
,,
3,16," Brian, can you turn the oven off at three?
"
,,
3,16," No problem.
"
,,
3,16,"We'll shop, come home, eat,
"
,,
3,16,"and then it's off to the pageant
"
,,
3,16,"to see little Stewie play Baby Jesus.
"
,,
3,16,"Yes, yes. By all means
"
,,
3,16,"turn me into a child star.
"
,,
3,16,"Perhaps I can move to Californ-i-a and
"
,,
3,16,"wrangle a three-way with the Olsen twins.
"
,,
3,16,"There's a spot!
"
,,
3,16,"Ah, screw this.
"
,,
3,16,"OK, Peter. We'll each take
"
,,
3,16,"half the list to save time.
"
,,
3,16,"Kids, why don't you
"
,,
3,16,"take Stewie to see Santa?
"
,,
3,16,"Santa?
"
,,
3,16,"No, it's not possible!
"
,,
3,16,"Sitting alone in this public setting?
"
,,
3,16,"No bulletproof glass?
"
,,
3,16,"Claus, you make it too easy.
"
,,
3,16,"Change me! I've leaked,
"
,,
3,16,"and I won't face him wet!
"
,,
3,16,"We return to
"
,,
3,16,"""Bob Hope's Christmas With The Troops"".
"
,,
3,16,"It's good to see you.
"
,,
3,16,"I would've been here sooner,
"
,,
3,16,"but Lincoln gave me
"
,,
3,16,"the wrong Gettysburg Address.
"
,,
3,16,"How about this having
"
,,
3,16,"to sit still for 60 seconds
"
,,
3,16,"to have your picture taken?
"
,,
3,16,"Ah, sweet! It's Kiss Saves Santa.
"
,,
3,16,"Hang on, Santa. We're coming!
"
,,
3,16,"Hurry! The eggs are hatching!
"
,,
3,16," What do we do?
"
,,
3,16," Wait a second.
"
,,
3,16,"Everyone knows pterodactyls
"
,,
3,16,"can't stand the screech of a guitar!
"
,,
3,16," It's working!
"
,,
3,16," Santa, be careful!
"
,,
3,16," Careful, Santa!
"
,,
3,16," Hang on, Santa!
"
,,
3,16," I was watching that! Hey!
"
,,
3,16," It'll be on next Christmas.
"
,,
3,16,"Who the hell knows when that will be?
"
,,
3,16,"Agh!
"
,,
3,16,"If I was an oven mitt...
"
,,
3,16,"Dammit, Peter!
"
,,
3,16,"Ho, ho, ho.
"
,,
3,16,"And what can I bring you this year?
"
,,
3,16,"A peace offering, is it? Very well.
"
,,
3,16,"Trim those gin-soaked whiskers
"
,,
3,16,"and bring me plutonium.
"
,,
3,16," Can you be a good boy?
"
,,
3,16," Hm, your inquiry intrigues me.
"
,,
3,16,"Can any of us be good? Are our primal
"
,,
3,16,"urges innate or the result of our choices?
"
,,
3,16,"OK, wrap it up, kid.
"
,,
3,16,"All right, Kringle! If the reward is plutonium,
"
,,
3,16,"then your wager is accepted. I will be nice.
"
,,
3,16,"Good boy! Now, smile for the camera.
"
,,
3,16,"Yes, yes, smile... like a good boy.
"
,,
3,16,"Aha! Meg's barrettes.
"
,,
3,16,"You mean Julie's barrettes!
"
,,
3,16,"You still want 'em, you bony old blue-hair?
"
,,
3,16,"Ow! Ow! Titty-twister! Ow! Hurts!
"
,,
3,16,"Hey!
"
,,
3,16,"Aha!
"
,,
3,16,"All the clown fish and yellow tangs
"
,,
3,16,"in the world can't help you now.
"
,,
3,16,"That's it? Fish food?
"
,,
3,16,"That's your ace in the hole?
"
,,
3,16,"Agh! Agh! Oh, God! Agh!
"
,,
3,16,"Phew.
"
,,
3,16,"Turkey!
"
,,
3,16,"Lois, it was horrible. The fish were
"
,,
3,16,"jumping all over my eyes and in my nose,
"
,,
3,16,"and one of them muttered
"
,,
3,16,"something anti-Semitic.
"
,,
3,16,"We're almost home, honey. Look.
"
,,
3,16,"There's the star on the town Christmas tree.
"
,,
3,16,"We're following it home,
"
,,
3,16,"like the Three Wise Men.
"
,,
3,16," So, what'd you get him?
"
,,
3,16," Gold.
"
,,
3,16,"Gold? I thought we agreed
"
,,
3,16,"on a $5 limit here.
"
,,
3,16," I just got him a crappy bottle of myrrh.
"
,,
3,16," Hello? Frankincense! You always do this!
"
,,
3,16,"Look, we'll put everything together
"
,,
3,16,"and put all our names on it.
"
,,
3,16," No!
"
,,
3,16," That's so chea...
"
,,
3,16," Yes!
"
,,
3,16," No! No, no, no, no, no!
"
,,
3,16,"You can't...
"
,,
3,16,"Oh, my God! Brian, are you OK?
"
,,
3,16,"I told you we should've left cookies for Santa.
"
,,
3,16,"Agh!
"
,,
3,16,"My couch! My TV! What the hell did you do?
"
,,
3,16,"Me? Who the hell buys
"
,,
3,16,"a novelty fire extinguisher?
"
,,
3,16,"Someone who cares enough about physical
"
,,
3,16,"comedy to put his family at serious risk.
"
,,
3,16,"Boys, please. It's Christmas Eve.
"
,,
3,16,"This is a night for magic and wonder and joy.
"
,,
3,16,"OK, so a couple of things have gone wrong.
"
,,
3,16,"But we can still have a great Christmas.
"
,,
3,16,"Jeez, kids. I was this close to losing it.
"
,,
3,16,"But your mom's right.
"
,,
3,16,"Sure I am.
"
,,
3,16,"Meg, honey, get me some paper towels.
"
,,
3,16,"Let's lose the bad tidings
"
,,
3,16,"and find that holiday cheer.
"
,,
3,16,"Yeah, all right.
"
,,
3,16,"We're out of paper towels.
"
,,
3,16,"No paper towels? Aaaaagh!
"
,,
3,16," I was gonna pick at that.
"
,,
3,16," Shut your fat mouth!
"
,,
3,16,"You all think Christmas just happens?
"
,,
3,16,"You think all this goodwill falls
"
,,
3,16,"from the freakin' sky? It doesn't!
"
,,
3,16,"It falls out of my holly-jolly butt!
"
,,
3,16,"So cook your own damn turkey,
"
,,
3,16,"wrap your own damn presents,
"
,,
3,16,"and while you're at it, you can all
"
,,
3,16,"ride a one-horse open sleigh to hell!
"
,,
3,16,"Aaagh!
"
,,
3,16,"Oh, here's the paper towels.
"
,,
3,16,"I-I-I changed my mind.
"
,,
3,16,"Clarence, I wanna live again!
"
,,
3,16,"I wanna live again!
"
,,
3,16,"Whoa!
"
,,
3,16,"Hey, I guess there's some magic
"
,,
3,16,"in that old silk hat.
"
,,
3,16,"Merry Christmas!
"
,,
3,16," Easy, lady.
"
,,
3,16," You want some of this!
"
,,
3,16," What the hell is her problem?
"
,,
3,16," Frosty, let it go!
"
,,
3,16,"Just a second.
"
,,
3,16,"You got something to say to me?
"
,,
3,16,"All he did was wish you a merry Christmas.
"
,,
3,16,"Wish? It's easy to wish.
"
,,
3,16,"But does anyone take responsibility
"
,,
3,16,"and make it happen? No!
"
,,
3,16,"You all expect someone else to do it
"
,,
3,16,"for you, like Santy Claus or Mommy!
"
,,
3,16,"Ah! Ow! What the...?
"
,,
3,16,"Take it off! Take it off!
"
,,
3,16,"Must... kill... star.
"
,,
3,16,"Dad, what happened to Mom?
"
,,
3,16,"What if she never comes back?
"
,,
3,16,"If this is the way she's gonna act
"
,,
3,16,"at Christmas, do we even want her back?
"
,,
3,16,"Which is better? Around the waist
"
,,
3,16,"or off the shoulder? Waist? Shoulder?
"
,,
3,16,"I thought you didn't
"
,,
3,16,"wanna be in the pageant.
"
,,
3,16,"Megan, Santa would think it terribly naughty
"
,,
3,16,"of me not to fulfil my obligation to Mother.
"
,,
3,16," The pageant means so much to her.
"
,,
3,16," Where do you think she is?
"
,,
3,16,"Thank God years ago I planted
"
,,
3,16,"a homing device in her skull
"
,,
3,16,"for just such an occasion.
"
,,
3,16,"I forgot. I also put 'em in some squirrels.
"
,,
3,16,"This won't do any good.
"
,,
3,16,"Let's see if she's at the pageant.
"
,,
3,16,"You... you lied to me.
"
,,
3,16,"Oh, my God! There's Mom!
"
,,
3,16,"Hi, Lois! Do we look like ants down here?
"
,,
3,16,"Bite me!
"
,,
3,16,"Great time last night.
"
,,
3,16,"Don't worry. We'll get Lois down.
"
,,
3,16," Locked and loaded.
"
,,
3,16," You can't shoot my mom!
"
,,
3,16,"Don't worry, kid.
"
,,
3,16,"It's just a mild sedative. Go!
"
,,
3,16,"Hang on. Lois is only up there because we
"
,,
3,16,"sucked the Christmas spirit right out of her.
"
,,
3,16,"Maybe if she sees the pageant,
"
,,
3,16,"it'll bring her around.
"
,,
3,16,"Trust him. He's seen every
"
,,
3,16,"Christmas special ever made.
"
,,
3,16," Are you wearing a girl's sweater?
"
,,
3,16," Does that matter now?
"
,,
3,16,"You got ten minutes.
"
,,
3,16,"Lights, please.
"
,,
3,16,"As we all know, Christmas
"
,,
3,16,"is that mystical time of year
"
,,
3,16,"when the ghost of Jesus rises from
"
,,
3,16,"the grave to feed on the flesh of the living.
"
,,
3,16,"So we sing Christmas carols
"
,,
3,16,"to lull him to sleep.
"
,,
3,16,"How dare he say such blasphemy!
"
,,
3,16,"I've gotta do something!
"
,,
3,16,"Bob, there's nothing you can do.
"
,,
3,16,"I guess I'll just have to
"
,,
3,16,"develop a sense of humour.
"
,,
3,16,"I am the Virgin Mary.
"
,,
3,16,"That's my story and I'm sticking to it.
"
,,
3,16,"Oh, our saviour has arrived!
"
,,
3,16,"Good evening. I'm playing the role of Jesus,
"
,,
3,16,"a man once portrayed on the big screen
"
,,
3,16,"by Jeffrey Hunter.
"
,,
3,16,"You may remember him as the actor
"
,,
3,16,"replaced by William Shatner on Star Trek.
"
,,
3,16,"Mr Hunter was good enough
"
,,
3,16,"to die for our sins,
"
,,
3,16,"but not quite up to the task
"
,,
3,16,"of seducing green women.
"
,,
3,16,"Anyhoo, the perennial dictum is
"
,,
3,16,"to spread goodwill towards all men.
"
,,
3,16,"The irony is that this is
"
,,
3,16,"contrary to our nature.
"
,,
3,16,"So why do we do it?
"
,,
3,16,"Because we are being watched!
"
,,
3,16,"And so we unselfishly think of others,
"
,,
3,16,"assured that our good behaviour will
"
,,
3,16,"be rewarded with love... and plutonium.
"
,,
3,16,"She's not getting it.
"
,,
3,16,"OK, take her down.
"
,,
3,16," Merry Christmas, buddy.
"
,,
3,16," Wonder what this could be.
"
,,
3,16,"Oh.
"
,,
3,16," This Christmas rocks!
"
,,
3,16," Mom, Stewie's opening his gifts. Mom?
"
,,
3,16,"It's OK. Your mom's just
"
,,
3,16,"full of Christmas cheer
"
,,
3,16,"and enough tranquilliser
"
,,
3,16,"to bring down a bull elephant.
"
,,
3,16,"Honey, you got a little some...
"
,,
3,16,"You got a little... Oh, I'll get it.
"
,,
3,16,"Hungry Hungry Hippos?
"
,,
3,16,"Claus, you porcine double-crosser!
"
,,
3,16," And to think I was nice!
"
,,
3,16," You got another one, dude.
"
,,
3,16,"Plutonium!
"
,,
3,16,"He is real! He's really, really real!
"
,,
3,16," Did you get everything you wanted?
"
,,
3,16," You bet. A week's vacation, a new VCR,
"
,,
3,16,"and best of all,
"
,,
3,16,"my own copy of Kiss Saves Santa.
"
,,
3,16,"You just practise that guitar, Santa.
"
,,
3,16,"Next time we'll let you do a solo.
"
,,
3,16,"Don't encourage him!
"
,,
3,16," From all of us at Family Guy...
"
,,
3,16," We wish you Christmas joy.
"
,,
3,16,"May all your wishes come true...
"
,,
3,16,"For every girl and boy.
"
,,
3,16,"We hope your freakin' holidays
"
,,
3,16,"are filled with fun and cheer.
"
,,
3,16,"So have a Merry Christmas and...

"
,,
3,17," So, tell me about yourself, Tina.
"
,,
3,17," I really love music.
"
,,
3,17,"Me, too. I just saw Don Giovanni. In my
"
,,
3,17,"opinion, the best opera of the 18th century.
"
,,
3,17," Definitely.
"
,,
3,17," And the use of recitative throughout...
"
,,
3,17," Mozart was a genius.
"
,,
3,17," Oh, yeah, re... cita... tive...
"
,,
3,17,"is really, you know, where it's at.
"
,,
3,17," Sir, are we ready to order?
"
,,
3,17," Whoa. Hold on a second.
"
,,
3,17," You don't know what I'm talking about.
"
,,
3,17," Sure I do. Opera's bitchin'!
"
,,
3,17,"OK. I guess I'll have the escar-got
"
,,
3,17,"and a glass of chab-lis.
"
,,
3,17,"Same here. Escar-got and the chab-lis.
"
,,
3,17,"Don't dawdle, Jonas. Play your exercises.
"
,,
3,17,"Brian, what happened with your date?
"
,,
3,17," Same as always. She was an idiot.
"
,,
3,17," Oh, Brian.
"
,,
3,17,"Don't slow down, Jonas. Keep the rhythm.
"
,,
3,17,"""Bum, bum, bum, bum
"
,,
3,17,"Brian, your standards are ridiculously high

"
,,
3,17," Hang on a second.
"
,,
3,17,"Now back to ""The Life and Times
"
,,
3,17,"of Grizzly Adams"".
"
,,
3,17," Grizzly? Who's Steve?
"
,,
3,17," What?
"
,,
3,17,"There's a message
"
,,
3,17,"on the machine from Steve.
"
,,
3,17,"Oh, yeah, Steve. He's... new to the mountain.
"
,,
3,17,"I met him down at the general store.
"
,,
3,17," He makes canoes.
"
,,
3,17," Oh.
"
,,
3,17," How come I've never met him?
"
,,
3,17," He hasn't really been here that long.
"
,,
3,17," Long enough to get your number!
"
,,
3,17," Ben! Ben!
"
,,
3,17,"Dammit.
"
,,
3,17,"Look at that Grizzly Adams.
"
,,
3,17,"Look at how confident he is, how majestic.
"
,,
3,17," I'm gonna grow a beard.
"
,,
3,17," Peter, you know I hate beards.
"
,,
3,17,"Oh, no, it's time I joined the ranks
"
,,
3,17,"of great men with beards.
"
,,
3,17,"Why do you think Jesus Christ was
"
,,
3,17,"so popular? Because of all the magic tricks?
"
,,
3,17,"Brian's depressed. Could you take him
"
,,
3,17,"with you to the laser rock show tonight?
"
,,
3,17,"Sure. That's one thing I'm good at -
"
,,
3,17,"cheering people up.
"
,,
3,17,"Mr and Mrs Ramsey,
"
,,
3,17,"JonBenet's untimely death is a tragedy.
"
,,
3,17,"And I will not rest until
"
,,
3,17,"I find her killer, or killers.
"
,,
3,17,"Oh, really, don't bother.
"
,,
3,17,"Nothing's going to bring our baby back.
"
,,
3,17," No, I insist. I will make it my life's work...
"
,,
3,17," We're fine. Drop it.
"
,,
3,17,"The next laser rock show
"
,,
3,17,"will begin in 20 minutes.
"
,,
3,17,"You hear that, Brian? A laser rock show!
"
,,
3,17,"Come on, cheer up, would you?
"
,,
3,17,"I don't feel like it.
"
,,
3,17,"Binary code is a computer language in which
"
,,
3,17,"words are translated into zeroes and ones.
"
,,
3,17,"Anything can be expressed in binary,
"
,,
3,17,"as we demonstrate in this scene
"
,,
3,17,"from The Miracle Worker.
"
,,
3,17,"You don't think this is amazing?
"
,,
3,17,"When I saw this at the 1904 World's Fair,
"
,,
3,17,"I nearly crapped my pants!
"
,,
3,17,"All right! Virtual reality!
"
,,
3,17,"Whoa! You guys gotta try this!
"
,,
3,17,"Hey, look at me.
"
,,
3,17,"I'm a pole in a strip club! Oh!
"
,,
3,17,"It's showtime.
"
,,
3,17,"Oh! Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh!
"
,,
3,17,"Hey, stop! False alarm! Agh!
"
,,
3,17,"Oh, my God! I'm flying. I'm flying!
"
,,
3,17,"I'll have a Diet Sprite.
"
,,
3,17,"You are a filthy whore.
"
,,
3,17," OK, Johnny Depp or Richard Grieco?
"
,,
3,17," Oh, that's gross!
"
,,
3,17," Yeah, let's not do this.
"
,,
3,17," Come on.
"
,,
3,17,"If you're secure in your masculinity,
"
,,
3,17,"you can answer a hypothetical.
"
,,
3,17,"Johnny Depp, cos he kind of
"
,,
3,17,"looks like a chick.
"
,,
3,17," What about you, Peter?
"
,,
3,17," Oh, man. I don't know.
"
,,
3,17,"Richard Grieco would probably appreciate
"
,,
3,17,"you more. Not take you for granted.
"
,,
3,17,"With Johnny Depp,
"
,,
3,17,"he wouldn't really need you.
"
,,
3,17,"He'd probably sneak out
"
,,
3,17,"after you fell asleep.
"
,,
3,17,"Of course, with Johnny, you'd get
"
,,
3,17,"financial security. I'd go with Johnny.
"
,,
3,17,"Oh, great.
"
,,
3,17," Brian?
"
,,
3,17," Hey, Joe. How's it going?
"
,,
3,17,"Good. You were doing
"
,,
3,17,"a little swerving back there.
"
,,
3,17," Me and the boys were just...
"
,,
3,17," Whoa! You're off the meter, Brian.
"
,,
3,17," You're under arrest.
"
,,
3,17," Come on.
"
,,
3,17,"Move it!
"
,,
3,17," One of you guys all right to drive?
"
,,
3,17," Yeah, I can do it.
"
,,
3,17,"I'll meet you at The Drunken Clam.
"
,,
3,17,"We'll tie one on.
"
,,
3,17,"I'm very disappointed in you.
"
,,
3,17,"God, a DUl. I can't believe this.
"
,,
3,17,"I could actually go to jail.
"
,,
3,17,"It's OK. You'll get through this DUl
"
,,
3,17,"and you'll be a better person for it.
"
,,
3,17,"Hold on. Don't disguise his alcohol
"
,,
3,17,"dependence as a ticket to self-realisation.
"
,,
3,17,"You're not one to talk. Remember when I gave
"
,,
3,17,"you apple juice and told you it was wine?
"
,,
3,17," You are a special person.
"
,,
3,17," Thanks.
"
,,
3,17,"Now, come on. I'm being serious.
"
,,
3,17,"I will be serious here for a second.
"
,,
3,17,"Are you gonna listen to me?
"
,,
3,17,"Are you gonna listen to me
"
,,
3,17,"so I can tell you that I respect you?
"
,,
3,17,"Brian, I know this is a bad time for you.
"
,,
3,17,"And if I have any advice to give you,
"
,,
3,17,"it is this: Grow a beard.
"
,,
3,17,"I wish you'd shave that thing.
"
,,
3,17,"Beards are so ugly.
"
,,
3,17," Hey!
"
,,
3,17," Oh, relax, Wooly Willy.
"
,,
3,17,"There's lots of fun things you can do.
"
,,
3,17," There we go.
"
,,
3,17," Thanks!
"
,,
3,17,"On the charge of driving under
"
,,
3,17,"the influence, we find you guilty.
"
,,
3,17,"Good call. Churn the butter.
"
,,
3,17,"Ooh! Ooh!
"
,,
3,17,"In lieu of jail time, I sentence you
"
,,
3,17,"to 100 hours of community service.
"
,,
3,17,"Next item.
"
,,
3,17,"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
"
,,
3,17,"to join these two in holy matrimony.
"
,,
3,17,"If anyone objects to this union,
"
,,
3,17,"speak now or for ever hold your peace.
"
,,
3,17,"Quiet! You had your chance!
"
,,
3,17," What are you doing for community service?
"
,,
3,17," I got assigned to Outreach to the Elderly.
"
,,
3,17,"I gotta take care of an old woman
"
,,
3,17,"who hasn't been out in 30 years.
"
,,
3,17,"When I got caught at school
"
,,
3,17,"with my hand down my pants,
"
,,
3,17,"I had to keep it there for a whole week.
"
,,
3,17,"Ha! What a week!
"
,,
3,17,"Taking care of this old woman'll be
"
,,
3,17,"like baby-sitting, with bigger diapers.
"
,,
3,17,"Aha! So they do make bigger diapers!
"
,,
3,17,"That deceitful woman told me
"
,,
3,17,"I'd have to use the toilet.
"
,,
3,17,"Fie on the toilet! It's made slaves of you all.
"
,,
3,17,"I've seen it sitting in there,
"
,,
3,17,"lazy, slothful porcelain layabout
"
,,
3,17,"feeding on other people's doo-doos
"
,,
3,17,"while contributing nothing to society!
"
,,
3,17,"You get a job!
"
,,
3,17,"Pearl Burton? My name's Brian. I'm here
"
,,
3,17,"from the Outreach to the Elderly programme.
"
,,
3,17,"You're late!
"
,,
3,17," What the hell is this?
"
,,
3,17," Delousing powder!
"
,,
3,17,"Everyone on the outside is filthy!
"
,,
3,17," You could have warned me.
"
,,
3,17," OK. It's gonna burn like hell in 30 seconds.
"
,,
3,17,"I like my tea at four, my dinner at six.
"
,,
3,17,"I take my bath at seven
"
,,
3,17,"so I can listen to Paul Harvey.
"
,,
3,17,"You'll warm up my bath with quick bursts
"
,,
3,17,"from the faucet during commercials.
"
,,
3,17,"Paul Harvey moves seamlessly into
"
,,
3,17,"commercials. It's been 30 seconds.
"
,,
3,17," Stop scratching that thing.
"
,,
3,17," I can't. It's itching like crazy.
"
,,
3,17," Can I scratch your beard?
"
,,
3,17," You finished your homework?
"
,,
3,17," Yes.
"
,,
3,17," OK then.
"
,,
3,17,"Brian, you're quiet.
"
,,
3,17,"Is community service not going well?
"
,,
3,17,"Lois, it's horrible.
"
,,
3,17,"I was cleaning her house all day.
"
,,
3,17,"It's the worst job I've ever had.
"
,,
3,17,"Except for one.
"
,,
3,17,"Excuse me. Would you like
"
,,
3,17,"to taste my smoked-meat log?
"
,,
3,17," Here you go. Enjoy your food.
"
,,
3,17," Yes, enjoy your studio apartment.
"
,,
3,17," You got something right here.
"
,,
3,17," Where?
"
,,
3,17," Other side.
"
,,
3,17," Here?
"
,,
3,17," The left side.
"
,,
3,17," Here?
"
,,
3,17," Your other left.
"
,,
3,17," Where?
"
,,
3,17," Up a little.
"
,,
3,17," Is it gone?
"
,,
3,17," Go down.
"
,,
3,17," Is it gone?
"
,,
3,17,"Is it gone? Agh!
"
,,
3,17,"Get it off! Get it off! Get it off!
"
,,
3,17,"Peter, hold still!
"
,,
3,17," Don't touch that bird!
"
,,
3,17," What's it to you?
"
,,
3,17,"I'm Dr Goodman of the
"
,,
3,17,"Quahog Ornithological Society,
"
,,
3,17,"ironically dining in a restaurant
"
,,
3,17,"that serves poultry.
"
,,
3,17," Doctor, what is this?
"
,,
3,17," It's a very rare species.
"
,,
3,17,"The endangered White-rumped Swallow.
"
,,
3,17," Rump.
"
,,
3,17," This isn't funny, Chris!
"
,,
3,17,"Swallow. Look,
"
,,
3,17,"just get rid of this bird, all right?
"
,,
3,17,"I can't do that. Once the swallow has chosen
"
,,
3,17,"its nesting place, it's illegal to disturb it.
"
,,
3,17,"He can't have a bird in his beard.
"
,,
3,17,"You have to wait until the bird departs
"
,,
3,17,"of its own accord or you'll be prosecuted.
"
,,
3,17,"Wow! You sure know a lot of stuff.
"
,,
3,17," It's great to learn.
"
,,
3,17," Cos knowledge is power!
"
,,
3,17," What is this? Spit soup?
"
,,
3,17," Tomato bisque.
"
,,
3,17," What is this? Snot soup?
"
,,
3,17," Tomato bisque.
"
,,
3,17," What is this? Diarrhoea soup?
"
,,
3,17," I'm not making you anything else. Eat it.
"
,,
3,17,"Then I'll have to call the judge,
"
,,
3,17,"and that means you'll go to jail!
"
,,
3,17,"You're one phone call away from getting
"
,,
3,17,"a human booster shot from a guy named Mali.
"
,,
3,17," Dammit!
"
,,
3,17," Shh!
"
,,
3,17,"Sorry! Sorry!
"
,,
3,17," Shut up.
"
,,
3,17," There's nothing I can do.
"
,,
3,17," Take it outside.
"
,,
3,17," Ever heard of a sitter?
"
,,
3,17," It's an endangered species.
"
,,
3,17," I'll make you an endangered species!
"
,,
3,17," Good comeback, Potsie!
"
,,
3,17," I'll kick your ass!
"
,,
3,17," Yeah!
"
,,
3,17," Everybody shut up!
"
,,
3,17,"He has stopped squawking.
"
,,
3,17,"He's receded into my beard.
"
,,
3,17,"We can all watch the movie. Shut up.
"
,,
3,17,"Eric, we're all going
"
,,
3,17,"to Marty's after the movie.
"
,,
3,17," I love you so much.
"
,,
3,17," I love you too, honey.
"
,,
3,17," Aah!
"
,,
3,17," Aah!
"
,,
3,17," What's wrong?
"
,,
3,17," Aah!
"
,,
3,17," Aah!
"
,,
3,17," Aah!
"
,,
3,17,"That's it. You're history, pal. No bird
"
,,
3,17,"Frenches my wife and gets away with it.
"
,,
3,17," Help! Help! I've broken my hip!
"
,,
3,17," Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
"
,,
3,17,"Brian!
"
,,
3,17," 5.3 seconds. I could have been dead by now!
"
,,
3,17," You're not really...?
"
,,
3,17,"I heard you drop that light bulb, too.
"
,,
3,17,"That'll be 67 cents!
"
,,
3,17," Go warm me up some diarrhoea soup!
"
,,
3,17," That's it! I've had it with you, you old hag!
"
,,
3,17,"You're a miserable, dried-up shut-in, trying
"
,,
3,17,"to make everyone feel as bad as you do!
"
,,
3,17,"Why don't you do the world
"
,,
3,17,"a big favour and drop dead?!
"
,,
3,17," This last one won't open.
"
,,
3,17," You gotta jiggle it.
"
,,
3,17," Like this?
"
,,
3,17," Let me get it.
"
,,
3,17,"Oh, thanks. And... you know, drop dead.
"
,,
3,17,"Get out of my beard,
"
,,
3,17,"you squawking bastard!
"
,,
3,17,"Nothing. I was hoping
"
,,
3,17,"it wouldn't come to this.
"
,,
3,17,"Oh, my God! Peter, no!
"
,,
3,17,"Lois, the bird must die!
"
,,
3,17,"It's gone! It's gone! Oh, thank God!
"
,,
3,17,"Peter, what's that sound?
"
,,
3,17,"Oh, my God. They're babies.
"
,,
3,17,"Hey, look, Lois. There are
"
,,
3,17,"three of 'em, just like ours.
"
,,
3,17,"And, uh... um...
"
,,
3,17,"Sweet.
"
,,
3,17,"We now return to
"
,,
3,17,"E's mysteries and scandals.
"
,,
3,17," Pearl Burton, the Jingle Queen.
"
,,
3,17," Pearl?
"
,,
3,17,"I'm AJ Benza. You won't find Pearl's name
"
,,
3,17,"on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
"
,,
3,17,"Yet from 1945 to 1960, you couldn't
"
,,
3,17,"turn on a radio or television
"
,,
3,17,"without hearing one
"
,,
3,17,"of her trademark jingles.
"
,,
3,17,"""You're only healthy when you're tan
"
,,
3,17,"""So soak up all the sun you can
"
,,
3,17,"""With Copper... Coppertone
"
,,
3,17,"At her peak, Pearl Burton
"
,,
3,17,"earned 26 grand a year,
"
,,
3,17,"which, by today's standards,
"
,,
3,17,"would be just under 49 billion dollars.
"
,,
3,17," Brian, she's beautiful.
"
,,
3,17," Yeah, and that voice. I had no idea.
"
,,
3,17,"In 1961, Pearl used an appearance
"
,,
3,17,"at Carnegie Hall to make the leap
"
,,
3,17,"from jingle-singer to artist.
"
,,
3,17,"That's ""Habanera"" from Carmen.
"
,,
3,17,"Oh, I've never heard it sung so beautifully.
"
,,
3,17," Sing Coppertone!
"
,,
3,17," Yeah, Coppertone!
"
,,
3,17," Do Doan's Pills!
"
,,
3,17," Sing Gold Bond Medicated Powder!
"
,,
3,17," Pepsodent!
"
,,
3,17," Chiclets!
"
,,
3,17,"No one has seen Pearl Burton since
"
,,
3,17,"that fateful night over 30 years ago.
"
,,
3,17," She's presumed dead.
"
,,
3,17," My God. I said those awful things to her!
"
,,
3,17,"Pearl!
"
,,
3,17,"Pearl, don't do this!
"
,,
3,17,"You should be happy.
"
,,
3,17,"I'm doing the world a big favour!
"
,,
3,17,"Move! Your fur is making my feet sweat!
"
,,
3,17,"Pearl, listen to me. I heard you sing.
"
,,
3,17,"It was the most beautiful sound
"
,,
3,17,"I've ever heard.
"
,,
3,17,"Oh, sure. Warbling for
"
,,
3,17,"Vick's VapoRub and Dippety-Do!
"
,,
3,17,"No, I mean...
"
,,
3,17,"Stop trying to talk me out of it!
"
,,
3,17,"I'm a pathetic sellout!
"
,,
3,17,"No one who sings Carmen
"
,,
3,17,"like you is pathetic!
"
,,
3,17," What?
"
,,
3,17," I heard you sing ""Habanera"".
"
,,
3,17," You were sublime.
"
,,
3,17," You... you liked my aria?
"
,,
3,17,"I was overwhelmed.
"
,,
3,17,"You're the first person who ever
"
,,
3,17,"complimented my ""Habanera"". Thank you.
"
,,
3,17,"Well... I'd better get going.
"
,,
3,17,"I'll see you tomorrow.
"
,,
3,17," But you're not scheduled tomorrow.
"
,,
3,17," I know.
"
,,
3,17,"And then the cow came out of the barn.
"
,,
3,17,"See? Look, there's the cow.
"
,,
3,17,"And what does a cow say?
"
,,
3,17,"Yes! Yes, that's right.
"
,,
3,17,"A cow says ""Peep-peep-peep-peep. ""
"
,,
3,17," Peter, they're getting awfully big.
"
,,
3,17," So?
"
,,
3,17,"A mother knows when it's time
"

3,17,"Hey, they're free to go
"

"
,,
3,17,"Fine. I'll let 'em go.
"
,,
3,17," Pearl, do you rent or own?
"
,,
3,17," Own what?
"
,,
3,17,"Those wings, you angel.
"
,,
3,17,"That was fantastic. That was so incredible.
"
,,
3,17,"What do you want for dinner? I was thinking
"
,,
3,17,"of making that lamb and rice you love.
"
,,
3,17,"Pearl, what I'd really like
"
,,
3,17,"for dinner is to go out.
"
,,
3,17,"Brian, you know I can't do that.
"
,,
3,17,"I haven't left this house in such a long time.
"
,,
3,17," I'm afraid.
"
,,
3,17," I know. But I'll be with you.
"
,,
3,17,"I don't know.

3,18,"B-ball. That's what we called it.

3,18," Great show.
"

3,18," You did me perfectly.
"

3,18,"Me too. You are so talented.
"
,,
3,18,"That was awful. With practice

3,18,"you've seen all night?

3,18,"Mark! Wow, what a journey! Thank you.

3,18,"good work today, I got a surprise for you.

3,18,"Doritos!

3,18,"Not now. Later.
"
,,
3,18,"Help! Help!
"
,,
3,18,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,18,"Thank you. I was boogie-boarding
"

3,18,"and I got sucked out by the riptide.
"
,,
3,18," I thought I was a dead man.

3,18,"Good. I don't have to cook.
"
,,
3,18,"Cook anyway and we'll throw it out.
"
,,
3,18,"I don't want you to get rusty.
"
,,
3,18,"Peter, my audition's coming up.
"
,,
3,18,"Would you listen to my monologue?
"
,,
3,18,"Sure, buddy. Let's hear it.
"
,,
3,18," Julie, there's somethin' I gotta tell you...
"
,,
3,18," Ha! That's awesome. Go on.
"
,,
3,18," Uh... tell you. I saw Dr Philips...
"
,,
3,18," Wow! Yes! Yes! I love it.
"
,,
3,18,"...Dr Philips today.
"
,,
3,18,"I might not make it to Christmas.
"
,,
3,18,"Oh, drop the bomb. There's not
"
,,
3,18,"a dry eye in the house. Keep goin'.
"
,,
3,18,"No. I'm gonna stop.
"
,,
3,18,"Maybe we'll work on it later.
"
,,
3,18,"Well, just so you know, it was good,
"
,,
3,18,"but I was also being generous.
"
,,
3,18,"Well, you little jaybird! You wanna tell your
"
,,
3,18,"mommy and daddy the Griffins are here?
"
,,
3,18,"Come on in.
"
,,
3,18,"Welcome, Griffins.
"
,,
3,18,"Oh... uh...
"
,,
3,18," We must be early.
"
,,
3,18," Nonsense. You're right on time.
"
,,
3,18,"Oh, my God! She's got hair growin'
"
,,
3,18,"out of her boobs and up to her head.
"
,,
3,18,"You're, uh... You're completely...
"
,,
3,18," Nude? Yes, we're nudists.
"
,,
3,18," Permission to freak out.
"
,,
3,18," Peter, did you know this?
"
,,
3,18," I thought he lost his bathing suit.
"
,,
3,18,"So you're the man who saved
"
,,
3,18,"my husband's life. Dottie Campbell.
"
,,
3,18," What am I doing? Come here!
"
,,
3,18," Watch my hands, Lois.
"
,,
3,18,"See where they are? No touchie.
"
,,
3,18,"This is the back yard. That's premium
"
,,
3,18,"blue-tip Bermuda. Real hardy, but soft.
"
,,
3,18," Good Lord.
"
,,
3,18," Don't look directly into it, Lois.
"
,,
3,18,"The hot dogs and burgers are ready.
"
,,
3,18,"Can I get you a beer, Peter?
"
,,
3,18," What do you got?
"
,,
3,18," I've got Busch.
"
,,
3,18,"Oh, and Busch Light.
"
,,
3,18,"Sounds like Jeff's home.
"
,,
3,18," Hey, sport! How'd you do?
"
,,
3,18," I got first place, Dad.
"
,,
3,18,"Way to go, champ. Jeff plays
"
,,
3,18,"varsity tennis for Saint Genevieve High.
"
,,
3,18," Cool.
"
,,
3,18," Is this the biggest thing you've ever seen?
"
,,
3,18,"Don't get too cocky. I had a big one
"
,,
3,18,"like that when I was your age.
"
,,
3,18,"You were a show-off yourself, Dave.
"
,,
3,18,"You brought it out on our first date.
"
,,
3,18,"Lois, I'm scared. Oh, I'll get that.
"
,,
3,18,"Hey!
"
,,
3,18,"Oh, God! Oh, Dave, sorry! Oh, God!
"
,,
3,18," Boobies!
"
,,
3,18," That's enough. I'm glad to be out of there.
"
,,
3,18,"What those people are doing
"
,,
3,18,"just ain't natural.
"
,,
3,18," Boobies!
"
,,
3,18," Did you hear me, young man?
"
,,
3,18," What was the big deal? They were nice.
"
,,
3,18," Boobies!
"
,,
3,18," Peter.
"
,,
3,18," Do it.
"
,,
3,18," Did you have fun at the circus today, Chris?
"
,,
3,18," Elephants are bigger in person.
"
,,
3,18," Break a leg up there, Brian.
"
,,
3,18," You seem awfully enthusiastic.
"
,,
3,18,"At first I wanted you to fail. But then
"
,,
3,18,"I realised you'd be out five days a week,
"
,,
3,18,"which means I'd be free to throw
"
,,
3,18,"some of my sexy parties.
"
,,
3,18," Brian Griffin.
"
,,
3,18," Good luck, Brian.
"
,,
3,18,"Hi. I'm Brian Griffin, and this is
"
,,
3,18,"from John Waltz's Leaving Wichita.
"
,,
3,18,"Julie, there's somethin' I gotta tell you.
"
,,
3,18,"I saw Dr Philips today.
"
,,
3,18,"I might not make it to Christmas.
"
,,
3,18," Thank you. Next.
"
,,
3,18," Next?
"
,,
3,18,"Hold on, Brian. Stay up there.
"
,,
3,18,"See here! Brian Griffin is a brilliant actor
"
,,
3,18,"with talent and passion.
"
,,
3,18,"But you alleged experts
"
,,
3,18,"obviously didn't notice.
"
,,
3,18,"Well, I did notice.
"
,,
3,18,"I saw a man bare his soul up here.
"
,,
3,18,"His pain ran through my heart
"
,,
3,18,"like an errant locomotive.
"
,,
3,18,"But it was wasted. Wasted on all of you!
"
,,
3,18,"Well, it looks like we have to
"
,,
3,18,"reconsider. Brian, we want you...
"
,,
3,18," Yes!
"
,,
3,18,"... off the stage.
"
,,
3,18,"But your young friend would be perfect
"
,,
3,18,"for our rising-star programme.
"
,,
3,18,"Splendid! This calls for a sexy party.
"
,,
3,18,"OK, funcakes, let's do a scene.
"
,,
3,18,"Stewie, how about you and, let's see...
"
,,
3,18,"one of our veterans... Olivia.
"
,,
3,18,"I'm not doing a scene with him.
"
,,
3,18,"He's inexperienced.
"
,,
3,18,"He'll drag my whole performance down.
"
,,
3,18,"Are you serious? Is she serious?
"
,,
3,18,"OK, Stewie, I'll give you a solo exercise.
"
,,
3,18,"You're gonna do an exercise we call
"
,,
3,18,"""The Life Cycle"". Without using words,
"
,,
3,18,"you're gonna act out your entire life
"
,,
3,18,"from birth to death as I describe it.
"
,,
3,18,"Ready? Lie down.
"
,,
3,18,"Now you're being born. Ready?
"
,,
3,18,"And burst through the placenta!
"
,,
3,18,"Now fast-forward. It's your first day of school.
"
,,
3,18,"You're alone and scared.
"
,,
3,18,"But it's all right. It's Sloppy Joe day.
"
,,
3,18,"Pull it back. The lady touched the bun
"
,,
3,18,"and she's not wearing gloves.
"
,,
3,18,"Fast-forward. You're a businessman,
"
,,
3,18,"you manage a lot of people.
"
,,
3,18,"Here comes Henderson.
"
,,
3,18,"He lost the big account. You're mad.
"
,,
3,18,"Madder. Madder!
"
,,
3,18,"Come on. Hot, hot.
"
,,
3,18,"There it is. You got it.
"
,,
3,18,"And fast-forward. You're an old man now.
"
,,
3,18,"You're on your deathbed.
"
,,
3,18,"Your son is holding your hand.
"
,,
3,18,"You tell him you accept his lifestyle
"
,,
3,18,"and regret humiliating him at his sister's
"
,,
3,18,"wedding by calling him your other daughter.
"
,,
3,18,"And... scene. OK, any comments?
"
,,
3,18,"You are the weakest link. Goodbye.
"
,,
3,18,"Ha, ha, ha! Oh, gosh, that's funny.
"
,,
3,18,"That's really funny.
"
,,
3,18,"Do you write your own material?
"
,,
3,18,"That is so fresh.
"
,,
3,18,"""You are the weakest link. Goodbye. ""
"
,,
3,18,"I've never heard anyone make
"
,,
3,18,"that joke before. You're the first.
"
,,
3,18,"I've never heard anyone reference that
"
,,
3,18,"outside the programme before.
"
,,
3,18,"That's what she says on the show, right?
"
,,
3,18,"""You are the weakest link. Goodbye. ""
"
,,
3,18,"You've taken that and used it out of context
"
,,
3,18,"to insult me in this everyday situation.
"
,,
3,18,"What a clever, smart girl you must be
"
,,
3,18,"to come up with a joke like that
"
,,
3,18,"all by yourself.
"
,,
3,18,"Mm. That's so fresh, too.
"
,,
3,18,"Any Titanic jokes you want to throw at me
"
,,
3,18,"while we're hitting these phenomena
"
,,
3,18,"at the height of their popularity?
"
,,
3,18,"Cos I'm here.
"
,,
3,18,"God, you're so funny!
"
,,
3,18," Meg?
"
,,
3,18," Jeff! Wow, hey!
"
,,
3,18," What are you doing here?
"
,,
3,18," They had a sale on Super Soakers.
"
,,
3,18,"Agh! What the heck...?
"
,,
3,18," Nudist!
"
,,
3,18," My dad's a tailor, you jerk!
"
,,
3,18," Gosh, that's awful.
"
,,
3,18," That's all right. I'm used to it.
"
,,
3,18,"I'd better go. So, um... would you
"
,,
3,18,"wanna do something sometime?
"
,,
3,18," Sure. That'd be great.
"
,,
3,18," Cool. I'll call you later.
"
,,
3,18,"Holy moly! It must be my birthday.
"
,,
3,18,"Thank you. Thank you. That was, um...
"
,,
3,18,"""Me Farting"" by Chopin.
"
,,
3,18,"Thank you. Thank you very...
"
,,
3,18," So, Olivia. Beautiful day.
"
,,
3,18," You're not gonna fart again, are you?
"
,,
3,18,"Well, I'd love to stay and chat,
"
,,
3,18,"but you're a total bitch.
"
,,
3,18,"The quarterly review's tomorrow.
"
,,
3,18,"Think your kids will pass?
"
,,
3,18,"I'll tell you who won't.
"
,,
3,18,"It starts with an O and rhymes with Bolivia.
"
,,
3,18," Give up? Olivia.
"
,,
3,18," Really?
"
,,
3,18,"She's such a frosty box.
"
,,
3,18,"She won't work with anybody.
"
,,
3,18,"Stewie Griffin is also on the fence.
"
,,
3,18,"If he and Olivia don't deliver at their reviews,

3,18,"I'll spare you the details, but the phrase
"

3,18,"""garden variety"" appears a number of times.
"
,,
3,18," What am I going to do?
"
,,
3,18," What are we going to do?
"
,,
3,18,"Our evaluation's tomorrow.
"
,,
3,18,"You need someone to work with,
"
,,
3,18,"and I need someone to make me look good.
"
,,
3,18," I don't know.
"
,,
3,18," Fine. Refuse my offer.
"
,,
3,18,"Get booted out
"
,,
3,18,"and wind up like Linda Evans.
"
,,
3,18,"Linda Evans, we have a spill in aisle 9.
"
,,
3,18,"Linda Evans, a spill in aisle 9.
"
,,
3,18," Do you like yours with crust or without?
"
,,
3,18," How do you like yours?
"
,,
3,18,"Let's both answer at the same time.
"
,,
3,18,"One, two, three.
"
,,
3,18," Without.
"
,,
3,18," Without.
"
,,
3,18,"Holy moly! That's eight things
"
,,
3,18,"we have in common.
"
,,
3,18," Kids, we're home.
"
,,
3,18," Hello, Mr and Mrs Griffin.
"
,,
3,18," You remember Jeff?
"
,,
3,18," Sure. Lois, I'm gonna borrow your mace.
"
,,
3,18,"Agh! That's better.
"
,,
3,18,"Meg, did any of the neighbours
"
,,
3,18,"see Jeff come over?
"
,,
3,18,"Mom! Come on, Jeff.
"
,,
3,18,"Let's go in the other room.
"
,,
3,18,"Now, Meg, no need to get so testes... testy.
"
,,
3,18,"Oh, nuts... I mean crap!
"
,,
3,18," You wanna sit down?
"
,,
3,18," Wait a second. Don't sit down yet.
"
,,
3,18," Dad, what are you doing?
"
,,
3,18," I'm, uh... keepin' the couch fresh.
"
,,
3,18," Dad!
"
,,
3,18," It's OK, Meg.
"
,,
3,18,"I understand what's goin' on. I'm gonna go.
"
,,
3,18,"Oh! Just step on these coasters
"
,,
3,18,"on your way out.
"
,,
3,18,"Don't step on the hot lava.
"
,,
3,18,"The carpet is hot lava.
"
,,
3,18,"I can't believe you guys!
"
,,
3,18,"How could you bring
"
,,
3,18,"that naked kid to our house?
"
,,
3,18,"Because I like him. He remembers my name.
"
,,
3,18,"I'm sorry, honey, but we don't think
"
,,
3,18,"you should see him any more.
"
,,
3,18,"I hate the sound of her cryin'.
"
,,
3,18,"You know what sounds even worse?
"
,,
3,18,"Ahh! Listen to that.
"
,,
3,18,"Don't you hate that?
"
,,
3,18,"That is awful.
"
,,
3,18,"I think it's easier on me
"
,,
3,18,"cos I'm the one makin' the sound.
"
,,
3,18,"Nice effort, Brad. But let's remember
"
,,
3,18,"our performance hierarchy:
"
,,
3,18,"Legitimate theatre, musical,
"
,,
3,18,"stand-up, ventriloquism, magic, mime.
"
,,
3,18,"Next up is Olivia. Liv, what monologue
"
,,
3,18,"are you doing for us this time?
"
,,
3,18,"I'm not doing a monologue.
"
,,
3,18,"I'm doing a piece with Stewie.
"
,,
3,18,"A duet? Really? Let's see it.

"
,,
3,18,"They're awfully young.
"

3,18,"Is this really a good idea?
"

3,18,"It's a great idea. I've always
"

3,18,"dreamed of becoming an actress.
"
,,
3,18,"That's not why I'm pushing Olivia.
"
,,
3,18,"Is it suspicious that I said that?
"
,,
3,18,"Well, I guess it might be OK.
"
,,
3,18,"Sure, Lois. Look at Elroy Jetson. He was
"

3,18,"a child actor and he turned out fine.
"
,,
3,18,"Do you know who I am? I'm Elroy Jetson.
"

"

3,18," Yes, we're a hit. You were amazing.
"
,,
3,18," So were you.
"
,,
3,18,"It was a good crowd. They didn't
"
,,
3,18,"notice you missed that F sharp.
"
,,
3,18," Yes, well... Beg pardon?
"
,,
3,18," The F sharp, darling. You were slightly off.
"
,,
3,18," I'm sure I wasn't.
"
,,
3,18," Well, maybe it was me.
"
,,
3,18," Must've been you.
"

3,18," I was being sarcastic.
"
,,
3,18," Well, it wasn't me.
"

3,18," Well, it wasn't me.

3,18,"Like this. Listen to me.
"

3,18,"Hi, Meg.
"
,,
3,18,"Peter, was it unfair of us to tell Meg
"
,,
3,18,"she couldn't see that boy?
"
,,
3,18,"Completely. We totally reamed her. Did you
"
,,
3,18,"see that look in her eyes? She hates you.
"
,,
3,18,"There it is, kids. Your first marquee.
"
,,
3,18,"Meet you inside.
"
,,
3,18," Exciting.
"
,,
3,18," The marquee or the other thing?
"
,,
3,18," What other thing?
"
,,
3,18," The sex... with Simon.
"
,,
3,18," Why else would your name be first?
"
,,
3,18," It's obvious.
"
,,
3,18,"Lead with strength, put your best foot

3,18,"I'm not supposed to see you.
"
,,
3,18," Your parents invited me.
"
,,
3,18," But they wouldn't...
"
,,
3,18," Yes, we would.
"
,,
3,18," Oh, my God! What are you doing?!
"
,,
3,18,"We were wrong, Meg. If you like Jeff,
"
,,
3,18,"we should give him a chance.
"
,,
3,18,"We wanted him to feel welcome in our home.
"

3,18,"Mom, I need new batteries for my Walkman.

3,18,"Hey! Why is everybody else naked?
"
,,
3,18,"Yahtzee! I win!
"
,,
3,18,"Yeah! In your face! In your face! In your face!
"
,,
3,18," I gotta go. Thanks, Mr and Mrs Griffin.
"
,,
3,18," Our pleasure.
"
,,
3,18,"Nice hanging with you.
"
,,
3,18," I hope my parents didn't embarrass you.
"
,,
3,18," Are you kidding? I think they're great.
"
,,
3,18,"It took a lot of guts for them to do that.
"
,,
3,18,"I'll see you later.
"
,,
3,18,"Thanks, you guys. That was really cool.
"
,,
3,18,"Peter, can I borrow your lawn mower?
"
,,
3,18,"Agh... You got a towel?
"
,,
3,18,"Simon, would you be a dear and ask Stewie
"
,,
3,18,"to dance on his own feet tonight?
"
,,
3,18,"Could you provide Olivia with a bucket
"
,,
3,18,"so she can carry a tune?
"
,,
3,18,"People, stop this craziness!
"
,,
3,18,"The Providence Journal's critic is here.

3,18," Let's just get through this.
"
,,
3,18," Fine with me.

3,18,"Wait a minute. You're wearing ruby lipstick.
"
,,
3,18,"You're painted up like some jezebel.

3,18,"You're one to talk. You've been

3,18,"It's where I keep my peppermint Mentos.

3,18,"Just because your breath reeks of rotten
"
,,
3,18,"Lunchables doesn't mean mine has to.
"
,,
3,18,"Break it up! Break it up!
"
,,
3,18,"I don't need this act and I don't need you.
"
,,
3,18,"You've done nothing but hold me back. I quit!
"
,,
3,18,"All I've held you back from is failure.
"
,,
3,18,"Come on, Simon.
"
,,
3,18,"We don't need that Bebe No-worth.
"
,,
3,18,"I don't know, Stewie. Without Olivia, this act
"
,,
3,18,"is like Fire Island after Labor Day: Over.
"
,,
3,18,"Fine. I don't need you.
"
,,
3,18,"I can manage my own career.
"
,,
3,18,"Yes. Yes, I'm quite capable of that.

3,18," I'm not speaking to you.

3,18," But...
"
,,
3,18," Shut up!
"
,,
3,18,"I guess the best advice I got
"
,,
3,18,"was from Marty Scorsese.
"
,,
3,18,"I was having a problem understanding
"

3,18,"why I'd been taking abuse

3,18,"I must be an absolute mess.
"

3,18,"See you on the coast.

3,19,"And I'm ashamed of myself
"
,,
3,19,"that I let Peter's jealousy prevent me
"
,,
3,19,"from rekindling an old friendship
"
,,
3,19,"just because it was with a man.
"
,,
3,19,"Peter's not very understanding
"
,,
3,19,"when it comes to you and other men.
"
,,
3,19,"Like that time at the movies?
"
,,
3,19,"I... I... this is... My, this is terribly awkward.
"
,,
3,19,"But I... I wanted to tell you something.
"
,,
3,19,"But I... I seem to be
"
,,
3,19,"so charmingly befuddled.
"
,,
3,19," Ah, that Hugh Grant is so handsome.
"
,,
3,19," Oh, is that how it is?
"
,,
3,19,"Come here, you home-wrecking bastard!
"
,,
3,19,"Don't do it, Dad! He's bigger than you!
"
,,
3,19,"And when you went to that concert?
"
,,
3,19,"Thank you. Thank you very much.
"
,,
3,19,"This next one is for all the ladies out there.
"
,,
3,19,"Then there was last Saturday night.
"
,,
3,19," Oh, look at that handsome man.
"
,,
3,19," You son of a bitch!
"
,,
3,19,"I can't let Peter's irrational
"
,,
3,19,"emotions run my life!
"
,,
3,19,"I'm gonna call Ross and see
"
,,
3,19,"if it's not too late for his offer.
"
,,
3,19," Would you mind finishing up?
"
,,
3,19," Sure.
"
,,
3,19,"Yes, do you like cleaning my doody, Brian?
"
,,
3,19,"Say it. Say ""I like cleaning your doody,
"
,,
3,19,"Stewie. "" Ha! Don't forget the taint.
"
,,
3,19,"TC, fly the chopper around the island.
"
,,
3,19,"I'll talk to the women.
"
,,
3,19," Tattoo here will look out for the kidnappers.
"
,,
3,19," Higgins.
"
,,
3,19,"We'll need security to unlock
"
,,
3,19,"the gate for me. OK, Tattoo?
"
,,
3,19," It's Higgins.
"
,,
3,19," What?
"
,,
3,19,"The name is Higgins.
"
,,
3,19," What's your name?
"
,,
3,19," Tattoo.
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, Peter. I'm just...
"
,,
3,19,"gonna go out for a few hours.
"
,,
3,19,"So, I... I'll return in... a few hours.
"
,,
3,19,"Yeah, I'll do it when this is over.
"
,,
3,19,"Hey, Lois, can you grab me a beer?
"
,,
3,19," Lois?
"
,,
3,19," Dad, I think she went out.
"
,,
3,19," Then you be Lois.
"
,,
3,19," OK.
"
,,
3,19,"Lois, can you grab me a beer?
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, my God! You've really let yourself go!
"
,,
3,19,"Maybe if you bought me
"
,,
3,19,"nice clothes once in a while!
"
,,
3,19,"Peter Griffin, we know you're in there!
"
,,
3,19,"Come out with your hands up!
"
,,
3,19,"Fooled ya!
"
,,
3,19,"You sure did. What the hell is this?
"
,,
3,19,"The new police surveillance van.
"
,,
3,19,"We're going on a beer run. Wanna join us?
"
,,
3,19,"I quit drinking. I might be an alcoholic.
"
,,
3,19," What?
"
,,
3,19," Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,19,"Fooled ya! Come on. Let's go drink
"
,,
3,19,"till we can't feel feelings any more.
"
,,
3,19,"This van has the latest in
"
,,
3,19,"law-enforcement technology. Watch.
"
,,
3,19,"Suspect! Suspect!
"
,,
3,19,"You have the right to remain silent!
"
,,
3,19,"Sweet.
"
,,
3,19," Let me try.
"
,,
3,19," Cleveland, don't!
"
,,
3,19,"Minority suspect! Minority suspect!
"
,,
3,19,"Danger, he's got a gun!
"
,,
3,19,"Oh! Ow! Ow! Oh! Ow! Oh! Ow!
"
,,
3,19,"Hey, Joe! The van's gone!
"
,,
3,19,"It's got a cloaking device that
"
,,
3,19,"disguises it as two homeless guys
"
,,
3,19,"fighting over a wedge of cheese.
"
,,
3,19,"Peter, isn't that Lois
"
,,
3,19,"over there in that diner?
"
,,
3,19," Why would Lois be there? I already ate.
"
,,
3,19," Take a look.
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, my God! That is Lois!
"
,,
3,19,"Why the hell would she...
"
,,
3,19,"Whoa. I can see your skin cells.
"
,,
3,19,"I saw you on Scientific American.
"
,,
3,19,"You looked great.
"
,,
3,19," Please! Where my eyes are half-closed?
"
,,
3,19," God, just take the damn compliment!
"
,,
3,19," What is Lois doing with another man?
"
,,
3,19," Is it possible she's a whore?
"
,,
3,19,"Just on weekends? To help pay for
"
,,
3,19,"her mom's dialysis? As in my fantasy?
"
,,
3,19,"Let's start over. Hi, I'm Quagmire.
"
,,
3,19," I wish I knew what she was saying.
"
,,
3,19," I think I can help.
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, your wife and children are beautiful. It's
"
,,
3,19,"so good to catch up, Ross. I'm glad I called.
"
,,
3,19,"I'm glad you did, too.
"
,,
3,19,"Was your husband OK with you coming?
"
,,
3,19,"Uh... Yes, he turned out
"
,,
3,19,"to be just fine with it.
"
,,
3,19,"All right. Let's see what we can pick up.
"
,,
3,19,"Please don't spit in my eggs.
"
,,
3,19,"Please don't spit in my eggs.
"
,,
3,19,"Thank you for the eggs!
"
,,
3,19,"I hope he didn't spit in my eggs.
"
,,
3,19,"Doug, I spit in that guy's eggs.
"
,,
3,19,"Our armies are ready.
"
,,
3,19,"We will leave the sewers
"
,,
3,19,"and strike back at the humans
"
,,
3,19,"in the overworld.
"
,,
3,19,"I'm glad we both found someone
"
,,
3,19,"to make us happy.
"
,,
3,19,"I enjoy being with you, Ross.
"
,,
3,19,"I'm having a great time.
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, my God! That's who that is.
"
,,
3,19,"Ross Fishman, Lois's old boyfriend.
"
,,
3,19," We're losing them.
"
,,
3,19," I gotta hear more.
"
,,
3,19,"The power's not supposed to go that high!
"
,,
3,19,"Damn itch. I wonder who gave it to me.
"
,,
3,19,"Probably that skank who needed a ride.
"
,,
3,19,"Last time I do somebody a favour.
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, God! They must have heard me!
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, God! I can hear me!
"
,,
3,19,"Ugh! What the hell
"
,,
3,19,"do you think you're doing?!
"
,,
3,19,"I'm cleaning myself.
"
,,
3,19,"You were clean 15 minutes ago.
"
,,
3,19,"Now you're just on vacation.
"
,,
3,19,"So, Lois is seeing old boyfriends, huh?
"
,,
3,19,"Well, two can play at that game.
"
,,
3,19,"I just gotta find my little black book.
"
,,
3,19,"Ah, here it is.
"
,,
3,19," Brenda?
"
,,
3,19," Peter! Oh, my God. It's been 25 years!
"
,,
3,19,"Yeah. So, I guess you're married now, huh?
"
,,
3,19,"Yeah.
"
,,
3,19,"Hey, Ricky, you were right! I was pregnant!
"
,,
3,19,"Hey, what's up, Pete? Long time no see.
"
,,
3,19,"Patty, the years have been great to you.
"
,,
3,19," I owe that to my better half.
"
,,
3,19," Who is it, sir?
"
,,
3,19," Angie?
"
,,
3,19," Peter? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Come in!
"
,,
3,19,"Uh... what is all this stuff?
"
,,
3,19,"Peter, I have been waiting
"
,,
3,19,"for this moment for 25 years!
"
,,
3,19,"I haven't washed my hand
"
,,
3,19,"since you touched it.
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, my God! That's disgusting!
"
,,
3,19,"And look! Look! I left the toilet just
"
,,
3,19,"as it was the night we went to the prom.
"
,,
3,19,"It's the little piece of you
"
,,
3,19,"that's kept your memory alive.
"
,,
3,19,"But now I have you back.
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, well. At least I still have you.
"
,,
3,19,"You hungry?
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, crap.
"
,,
3,19,"Let me handle this.
"
,,
3,19,"You were going 65, fella. That's ten miles
"
,,
3,19,"over the... Why are you holding his hand?
"
,,
3,19," We met on the Internet.
"
,,
3,19," Shut up!
"
,,
3,19,"He lured me to the park with promises
"
,,
3,19,"of candy and funny stories.
"
,,
3,19," Ever hear of super industrial adhesive?
"
,,
3,19," Actually, yes, we have.
"
,,
3,19," Dad, why do you keep looking at the door?
"
,,
3,19," Oh, Meg. You and your drugs.
"
,,
3,19,"I wonder who that could be.
"
,,
3,19," Peter Gifford?
"
,,
3,19," My God! Dora, my old girlfriend.
"
,,
3,19,"What a surprise that you would look me up!
"
,,
3,19,"You always thought I was so handsome.
"
,,
3,19,"Peter, can I see you in the other room?
"
,,
3,19," Yeah, go. Say it.
"
,,
3,19," Should I?
"
,,
3,19," I can't.
"
,,
3,19," Just say it.
"
,,
3,19,"How far can you get this banana...
"
,,
3,19,"I can't say it. She's looking right at me.
"
,,
3,19,"What the hell is this about?
"
,,
3,19," It's about you and Ross Fishman!
"
,,
3,19," What?!
"
,,
3,19,"I saw you and him breaking
"
,,
3,19,"the Fifth Commandment!
"
,,
3,19,"Congress passes these things for a reason!
"
,,
3,19,"That's it! You're suffocating me
"
,,
3,19,"with your jealousy. I can't take it any more.
"
,,
3,19,"I'm calling a marriage counsellor.
"
,,
3,19,"I can't even have coffee with a friend!
"
,,
3,19," What is your problem?!
"
,,
3,19," You want to know what my problem is?
"
,,
3,19," I love too much!
"
,,
3,19," What are you talking about?
"
,,
3,19," Don't you see? We're alive!
"
,,
3,19," You're scaring me.
"
,,
3,19,"Good! Embrace the fear! Dance with me,
"
,,
3,19,"Lois. Dance the dance of life!
"
,,
3,19,"Maybe you should call that counsellor.
"
,,
3,19,"Mr and Mrs Griffin,
"
,,
3,19,"I've reviewed your situation.
"
,,
3,19," I have a suggestion.
"
,,
3,19," We'll do whatever it takes.
"
,,
3,19,"I'd like to put video cameras
"
,,
3,19,"in every room of your house
"
,,
3,19,"so I can observe your
"
,,
3,19,"uncensored behaviour.
"
,,
3,19,"Just like that show Big Brother.
"
,,
3,19,"Except somebody'll be watching.
"
,,
3,19,"I've looked through the footage.
"
,,
3,19,"I've compiled an accurate cross section
"
,,
3,19,"of your home life. Here are the results.
"
,,
3,19," Peter, give Chris a spanking.
"
,,
3,19," OK.
"
,,
3,19,"Chris, I'm watching the game.
"
,,
3,19,"You know what to do.
"
,,
3,19,"Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
"
,,
3,19,"This hurts me more than it hurts you. Ow!
"
,,
3,19,"""Dear Diary, Kevin is so hot. ""
"
,,
3,19,"""Today he was out
"
,,
3,19,"in the yard raking leaves. ""
"
,,
3,19,"""God, I wish he'd throw me
"
,,
3,19,"into that pile of leaves. ""
"
,,
3,19,"Hey, what's everybody...
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, my God! My diary! I hate you all!
"
,,
3,19,"Keep going.
"
,,
3,19,"No. It's step, hip, step, pivot.
"
,,
3,19,"Are you trying to piss off the volcano?
"
,,
3,19,"Get my back, would you?
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, that's it. Ooh, that feels good.
"
,,
3,19," Can you give me a hand with this jar?
"
,,
3,19," Oh, for heaven's sake, Peter.
"
,,
3,19,"Gotcha.
"
,,
3,19,"To be honest, I've never seen
"
,,
3,19,"such dysfunction.
"
,,
3,19,"Mr and Mrs Griffin, what I'm about
"
,,
3,19,"to suggest may seem unorthodox.
"
,,
3,19,"I recommend a trial separation, during which
"
,,
3,19,"time I advise that you date other people.
"
,,
3,19,"I believe this will help you
"
,,
3,19,"gather perspective.
"
,,
3,19," Date other people?!
"
,,
3,19," Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,19,"I realise this is upsetting.
"
,,
3,19,"That's why I've invited Howie Mandel
"
,,
3,19,"to lighten the mood by blowing up
"
,,
3,19,"a surgical glove with his nose.
"
,,
3,19,"This feels really weird, Lois.
"
,,
3,19,"I know. But maybe the doctor's right.
"
,,
3,19,"This time apart could be good for us.
"
,,
3,19,"I don't know. Splitting up didn't work
"
,,
3,19,"too well for Pacman and his wife.
"
,,
3,19," Forget about her.
"
,,
3,19," You're too good for her anyway.
"
,,
3,19," Cheer up, man.
"
,,
3,19," Hey, you want to eat us? Huh?
"
,,
3,19," We're turning blue!
"
,,
3,19," I've got nowhere to run.
"
,,
3,19,"He's gonna get us!
"
,,
3,19," Oh.
"
,,
3,19," Oh.
"
,,
3,19,"He's not budging.
"
,,
3,19,"Come on. Let's go to Qbert's.
"
,,
3,19," I appreciate you putting me up, Cleveland.
"
,,
3,19," Our house is your house, Peter.
"
,,
3,19,"I'd sit here and chat, but I need
"
,,
3,19,"to get back upstairs to Loretta
"
,,
3,19,"because it's our anniversary
"
,,
3,19,"and the getting's good.
"
,,
3,19,"Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
"
,,
3,19,"When is it gonna be my turn?
"
,,
3,19,"Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
"
,,
3,19,"You are welcome to stay
"
,,
3,19,"as long as you like.
"
,,
3,19,"Thanks, Muriel. So, what do you guys
"
,,
3,19,"do for fun around here?
"
,,
3,19,"We like to watch old movies
"
,,
3,19,"while listening to ""Hotel California""
"
,,
3,19,"to see if it syncs up in a significant way.
"
,,
3,19,"And so far, no. Nothing has.
"
,,
3,19," Hello?
"
,,
3,19," Is Peter there?
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, hi, Quagmire. No, Peter's not home.
"
,,
3,19,"We're... we're having
"
,,
3,19,"some minor marital problems.
"
,,
3,19,"Our therapist has advised us
"
,,
3,19,"to date other people.
"
,,
3,19," Hey, Lois, you want to go out?
"
,,
3,19," What? I don't know, Glen.
"
,,
3,19,"Peter and I just separated.
"
,,
3,19,"I feel like I need more time.
"
,,
3,19," How about now?
"
,,
3,19," We are supposed to see other people.
"
,,
3,19,"I guess it's better to go out
"
,,
3,19,"with you than some sex pervert.
"
,,
3,19,"I'm in! Giggetty-gaggety-gaggety-goo!
"
,,
3,19,"Oh. God blast it!
"
,,
3,19,"Will you hold it for five seconds?!
"
,,
3,19,"OK.
"
,,
3,19,"So, Mr Griffin, how does it feel
"
,,
3,19,"to be a bachelor on the prowl again?
"
,,
3,19,"It's not as great as you'd think. I don't have
"
,,
3,19,"the same way with women that I used to.
"
,,
3,19,"That was nice. That was nice.
"
,,
3,19,"I had a great time with you today,
"
,,
3,19,"beautiful stranger. What's your sign?
"
,,
3,19,"Gross. I still think
"
,,
3,19,"you're neat, though.
"
,,
3,19,"You should try a video dating service.
"
,,
3,19,"That's how Muriel and I met.
"
,,
3,19,"Let me show you Mort's tape.
"
,,
3,19,"He was so charming.
"
,,
3,19,"Agh! Oh, my eyes! Could you please
"
,,
3,19,"turn down that very bright light?
"
,,
3,19,"It's burning my retinas.
"
,,
3,19,"Ladies, I'm a very desperate man.
"
,,
3,19,"My name is Mort and I live with my mother.
"
,,
3,19,"And I have very low standards.
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, God!
"
,,
3,19,"There's blood in my mucus!
"
,,
3,19,"Agh! What the hell is wrong with you?!
"
,,
3,19,"Hey, there's the mail! Oh, finally.
"
,,
3,19,"It takes an hour for the solvent to take effect.
"
,,
3,19,"What takes an hour? We could watch
"
,,
3,19,"Rita Rudner do five minutes of stand-up.
"
,,
3,19,"Ba-zing.
"
,,
3,19,"We're gonna have a swell time tonight, Lois.
"
,,
3,19,"Thank you for being such a good friend
"
,,
3,19,"and looking after me.
"
,,
3,19,"No problem. It's chilly out,
"
,,
3,19,"so I brought you a jacket.
"
,,
3,19," Oh. No, thanks. I'll be fine.
"
,,
3,19," Please?
"
,,
3,19,"Muriel and I feel that you need to follow
"
,,
3,19,"your therapist's advice and start dating.
"
,,
3,19," Jeez, Mort. I don't know if I'm ready.
"
,,
3,19," Come on, stud.
"
,,
3,19,"We've set it up for you
"
,,
3,19,"to go out with our niece.
"
,,
3,19,"Honey! Come on out here
"
,,
3,19,"and meet Peter Griffin.
"
,,
3,19,"This is our niece, Jennifer Love Hewitt.
"
,,
3,19," Nice to meet you.
"
,,
3,19," All right, I'm getting up.
"
,,
3,19,"Hi. Peter Griffin. We can go anywhere except
"
,,
3,19,"the disco. They don't let me in any more.
"
,,
3,19,"Ow! Crafty Mexicans and your glass candy.
"
,,
3,19," What's going on?
"
,,
3,19," There's a girl in that well.
"
,,
3,19," Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,19," Nobody has arms long enough to reach her.
"
,,
3,19,"Except that guy. But he's helping
"
,,
3,19,"that woman tickle a midget.
"
,,
3,19,"Tee-hee. Stop it. Tee-hee.
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, God, you want to rescue her, don't you?
"
,,
3,19,"It's times like this I wish they'd
"
,,
3,19,"used me for stem-cell research.
"
,,
3,19,"Help me!
"
,,
3,19,"It rubs the lotion on its skin,
"
,,
3,19,"or else it gets the hose again. Ha!
"
,,
3,19,"All right, I'm gonna lower you in.
"
,,
3,19,"I just noticed. How often do you see
"
,,
3,19,"a 17th-century well in this day and age?
"
,,
3,19," Hurry up. The glue's wearing off!
"
,,
3,19," All right, all right!
"
,,
3,19,"We're not stuck together any more.
"
,,
3,19," Thank God!
"
,,
3,19," You said it.

"

3,19," Sure.
"

3,19,"Susie! Thank God you're all right!
"
,,
3,19,"Wait a minute. This isn't my little girl.
"
,,
3,19,"Hey, that was my wife!
"
,,
3,19," Tee-hee!
"
,,
3,19," Tee-hee!
"
,,
3,19," I Know What You Did Last Summer?
"
,,
3,19," Never heard of it.
"
,,
3,19," The Devil and Daniel Webster?
"
,,
3,19," Nope.
"
,,
3,19," Party of Five?
"
,,
3,19," Was that a porno?
"
,,
3,19,"Sometimes you gotta do a lot of crap
"
,,
3,19,"before they put you in anything decent.
"
,,
3,19,"The food here is fantastic.
"
,,
3,19,"This is where I took Lois on our first date.
"
,,
3,19,"You ordered a pie for an appetiser?
"
,,
3,19,"I'll go to the john and fire one out in five
"
,,
3,19,"minutes. That should make room for dinner.
"
,,
3,19," Here's your table, Mr Quagmire.
"
,,
3,19," Thanks. How about drinks?
"
,,
3,19,"Martini for you and the usual
"
,,
3,19,"roofie colada for your date?
"
,,
3,19,"No, no, no. I wouldn't bring...
"
,,
3,19,"A glass of wine.
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, my God! That's Jennifer Love Hewitt!
"
,,
3,19,"Wow! I wonder who she's here with.
"
,,
3,19,"She could date any man she wanted to.
"
,,
3,19,"There. Made lots of room.
"
,,
3,19,"That sign in the bathroom about washing
"
,,
3,19,"your hands, that's for the staff, right?
"
,,
3,19," Technically, yes.
"
,,
3,19," That's what I thought. Great.
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, man! These all look good,
"
,,
3,19,"every one of 'em.
"
,,
3,19," You want some bread?
"
,,
3,19," No!
"
,,
3,19,"Peter, is that you?
"
,,
3,19,"Peter?! Oh, no! I can't let him see me!
"
,,
3,19,"It's OK, Quagmire. We're just doing
"
,,
3,19,"what the therapist said to do.
"
,,
3,19,"Peter, I think it's great you're out
"
,,
3,19,"with Jennifer Love Hewitt.
"
,,
3,19,"Hi. I loved you in Heartbreakers.
"
,,
3,19,"You be on your best behaviour.
"
,,
3,19," Here you go, sweetheart. Open up.
"
,,
3,19," No!
"
,,
3,19,"There you go. Isn't this romantic?
"
,,
3,19,"That's it! You have got to be the most vile,
"
,,
3,19,"disgusting human being I've ever met!
"
,,
3,19,"And I have never been
"
,,
3,19,"more turned-on in my life.
"
,,
3,19,"Hold on, toots!
"
,,
3,19,"I don't care what our therapist says.
"
,,
3,19,"I won't stand by and watch my husband
"
,,
3,19,"lock lips with another woman! Beat it!
"
,,
3,19," What's your problem, grandma?
"
,,
3,19," You are!
"
,,
3,19,"And I only saw Heartbreakers on a plane!
"
,,
3,19,"And the flight was delayed,
"
,,
3,19,"so the headphones were free!
"
,,
3,19,"Wow. That was pretty cool, Lois.
"
,,
3,19,"I guess I finally understand...
"
,,
3,19,"You better run, you little bitch!
"
,,
3,19,"I guess I finally understand
"
,,
3,19,"how you can get so jealous sometimes.
"
,,
3,19,"Seeing her kiss you like that
"
,,
3,19,"just made me crazy.
"
,,
3,19,"I guess we're gonna have to learn
"
,,
3,19,"to control our jealousy... together.
"
,,
3,19,"Together.
"
,,
3,19,"Ma'am, you dropped your napkin.
"
,,
3,19,"Here's your drink, sir.
"
,,
3,19,"We'll work on it later. I love you, Lois.
"
,,
3,19,"I love you too, Peter.
"
,,
3,19,"What a couple of freaks.
"
,,
3,19,"God, I need a drink.
"
,,
3,19,"Waiter! Martini and a roofie colada.

3,19," For God's sake, don't be such a nerd.

"

3,19," Crap.
"
,,
3,19,"I can't tell you how wonderful
"

3,19,"it's been to see you.
"
,,
3,19,"It's a crime that it's been so long.
"
,,
3,19,"We were so close.
"
,,
3,19,"We could get together for coffee, catch up.
"
,,
3,19,"Well... I don't know, Ross. I'm married now.
"
,,
3,19,"So am I. Does that mean we're not allowed
"
,,
3,19,"to stay in touch with old friends?
"
,,
3,19,"Tell you what. If you change
"
,,
3,19,"your mind, here's my card.
"
,,
3,19,"Look, Dad. They have 12-packs of kidneys!
"
,,
3,19,"You got to buy the cooler, too.
"
,,
3,19,"That's how they get you.
"
,,
3,19," OK, thanks.
"
,,
3,19," Well?
"
,,
3,19,"The good news is they make
"
,,
3,19,"a solvent that'll get us unstuck.
"
,,
3,19,"But it takes two weeks for delivery.
"
,,
3,19,"We're stuck like this for a bloody fortnight?!
"
,,
3,19," You cannot tell Lois about this.
"
,,
3,19," What if I do?
"
,,
3,19," I have pictures of you in her wedding dress.
"
,,
3,19," You said there was no film in that camera!
"
,,
3,19," Stewie, it's time to change your diaper.
"
,,
3,19," Mind if I watch?
"
,,
3,19,"And I'm ashamed of myself
"
,,
3,19,"that I let Peter's jealousy prevent me
"
,,
3,19,"from rekindling an old friendship
"
,,
3,19,"just because it was with a man.
"
,,
3,19,"Peter's not very understanding
"
,,
3,19,"when it comes to you and other men.
"
,,
3,19,"Like that time at the movies?
"
,,
3,19,"I... I... this is... My, this is terribly awkward.
"
,,
3,19,"But I... I wanted to tell you something.
"
,,
3,19,"But I... I seem to be
"
,,
3,19,"so charmingly befuddled.
"
,,
3,19," Ah, that Hugh Grant is so handsome.
"
,,
3,19," Oh, is that how it is?
"
,,
3,19,"Come here, you home-wrecking bastard!
"
,,
3,19,"Don't do it, Dad! He's bigger than you!
"
,,
3,19,"And when you went to that concert?
"
,,
3,19,"Thank you. Thank you very much.
"
,,
3,19,"This next one is for all the ladies out there.
"
,,
3,19,"Then there was last Saturday night.
"
,,
3,19," Oh, look at that handsome man.
"
,,
3,19," You son of a bitch!
"
,,
3,19,"I can't let Peter's irrational
"
,,
3,19,"emotions run my life!
"
,,
3,19,"I'm gonna call Ross and see
"
,,
3,19,"if it's not too late for his offer.
"
,,
3,19," Would you mind finishing up?
"
,,
3,19," Sure.
"
,,
3,19,"Yes, do you like cleaning my doody, Brian?
"

"
,,
3,19," What's your name?

,,
3,19,"Oh, Peter. I'm just...
"
,,
3,19,"gonna go out for a few hours.
"
,,
3,19,"So, I... I'll return in... a few hours.
"
,,
3,19,"Yeah, I'll do it when this is over.
"
,,
3,19,"Hey, Lois, can you grab me a beer?
"
,,
3,19," Lois?
"
,,
3,19," Dad, I think she went out.
"
,,
3,19," Then you be Lois.
"
,,
3,19," OK.
"
,,
3,19,"Lois, can you grab me a beer?
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, my God! You've really let yourself go!
"
,,
3,19,"Maybe if you bought me
"
,,
3,19,"nice clothes once in a while!
"
,,
3,19,"Peter Griffin, we know you're in there!
"
,,
3,19,"Come out with your hands up!
"
,,
3,19,"Fooled ya!
"
,,
3,19,"You sure did. What the hell is this?
"
,,
3,19,"The new police surveillance van.
"
,,
3,19,"We're going on a beer run. Wanna join us?
"
,,
3,19,"I quit drinking. I might be an alcoholic.
"
,,
3,19," What?
"
,,
3,19," Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,19,"Fooled ya! Come on. Let's go drink
"
,,
3,19,"till we can't feel feelings any more.
"
,,
3,19,"This van has the latest in
"
,,
3,19,"law-enforcement technology. Watch.
"
,,
3,19,"Suspect! Suspect!
"
,,
3,19,"You have the right to remain silent!
"
,,
3,19,"Sweet.
"
,,
3,19," Let me try.
"
,,
3,19," Cleveland, don't!
"
,,
3,19,"Minority suspect! Minority suspect!
"
,,
3,19,"Danger, he's got a gun!
"
,,
3,19,"Oh! Ow! Ow! Oh! Ow! Oh! Ow!
"
,,
3,19,"Hey, Joe! The van's gone!
"
,,
3,19,"It's got a cloaking device that
"
,,
3,19,"disguises it as two homeless guys
"
,,
3,19,"fighting over a wedge of cheese.
"
,,
3,19,"Peter, isn't that Lois
"
,,
3,19,"over there in that diner?
"
,,
3,19," Why would Lois be there? I already ate.
"
,,
3,19," Take a look.
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, my God! That is Lois!
"
,,
3,19,"Why the hell would she...
"
,,
3,19,"Whoa. I can see your skin cells.
"
,,
3,19,"I saw you on Scientific American.
"
,,
3,19,"You looked great.
"
,,
3,19," Please! Where my eyes are half-closed?
"
,,
3,19," God, just take the damn compliment!
"
,,
3,19," What is Lois doing with another man?
"
,,
3,19," Is it possible she's a whore?
"
,,
3,19,"Just on weekends? To help pay for
"
,,
3,19,"her mom's dialysis? As in my fantasy?
"
,,
3,19,"Let's start over. Hi, I'm Quagmire.
"
,,
3,19," I wish I knew what she was saying.
"
,,
3,19," I think I can help.
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, your wife and children are beautiful. It's
"
,,
3,19,"so good to catch up, Ross. I'm glad I called.
"
,,
3,19,"I'm glad you did, too.
"
,,
3,19,"Was your husband OK with you coming?
"
,,
3,19,"Uh... Yes, he turned out
"
,,
3,19,"to be just fine with it.
"
,,
3,19,"All right. Let's see what we can pick up.
"
,,
3,19,"Please don't spit in my eggs.
"
,,
3,19,"Please don't spit in my eggs.
"
,,
3,19,"Thank you for the eggs!
"
,,
3,19,"I hope he didn't spit in my eggs.
"
,,
3,19,"Doug, I spit in that guy's eggs.
"
,,
3,19,"Our armies are ready.
"
,,
3,19,"We will leave the sewers
"
,,
3,19,"and strike back at the humans
"
,,
3,19,"in the overworld.
"
,,
3,19,"I'm glad we both found someone
"
,,
3,19,"to make us happy.
"
,,
3,19,"I enjoy being with you, Ross.
"
,,
3,19,"I'm having a great time.
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, my God! That's who that is.
"
,,
3,19,"Ross Fishman, Lois's old boyfriend.
"
,,
3,19," We're losing them.
"
,,
3,19," I gotta hear more.
"
,,
3,19,"The power's not supposed to go that high!
"
,,
3,19,"Damn itch. I wonder who gave it to me.
"
,,
3,19,"Probably that skank who needed a ride.
"
,,
3,19,"Last time I do somebody a favour.
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, God! They must have heard me!
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, God! I can hear me!
"
,,
3,19,"Ugh! What the hell
"
,,
3,19,"do you think you're doing?!
"
,,
3,19,"I'm cleaning myself.
"
,,
3,19,"You were clean 15 minutes ago.
"
,,
3,19,"Now you're just on vacation.
"
,,
3,19,"So, Lois is seeing old boyfriends, huh?
"
,,
3,19,"Well, two can play at that game.
"
,,
3,19,"I just gotta find my little black book.
"
,,
3,19,"Ah, here it is.
"
,,
3,19," Brenda?
"
,,
3,19," Peter! Oh, my God. It's been 25 years!
"
,,
3,19,"Yeah. So, I guess you're married now, huh?
"
,,
3,19,"Yeah.
"
,,
3,19,"Hey, Ricky, you were right! I was pregnant!
"
,,
3,19,"Hey, what's up, Pete? Long time no see.
"
,,
3,19,"Patty, the years have been great to you.
"
,,
3,19," I owe that to my better half.
"
,,
3,19," Who is it, sir?
"
,,
3,19," Angie?
"
,,
3,19," Peter? Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Come in!
"
,,
3,19,"Uh... what is all this stuff?
"
,,
3,19,"Peter, I have been waiting
"
,,
3,19,"for this moment for 25 years!
"
,,
3,19,"I haven't washed my hand
"
,,
3,19,"since you touched it.
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, my God! That's disgusting!
"
,,
3,19,"And look! Look! I left the toilet just
"
,,
3,19,"as it was the night we went to the prom.
"
,,
3,19,"It's the little piece of you
"
,,
3,19,"that's kept your memory alive.
"
,,
3,19,"But now I have you back.
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, well. At least I still have you.
"
,,
3,19,"You hungry?
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, crap.
"
,,
3,19,"Let me handle this.
"
,,
3,19,"You were going 65, fella. That's ten miles
"
,,
3,19,"over the... Why are you holding his hand?
"
,,
3,19," We met on the Internet.
"
,,
3,19," Shut up!
"
,,
3,19,"He lured me to the park with promises
"
,,
3,19,"of candy and funny stories.
"
,,
3,19," Ever hear of super industrial adhesive?
"
,,
3,19," Actually, yes, we have.
"
,,
3,19," Dad, why do you keep looking at the door?
"
,,
3,19," Oh, Meg. You and your drugs.
"
,,
3,19,"I wonder who that could be.
"
,,
3,19," Peter Gifford?
"
,,
3,19," My God! Dora, my old girlfriend.
"
,,
3,19,"What a surprise that you would look me up!
"
,,
3,19,"You always thought I was so handsome.
"
,,
3,19,"Peter, can I see you in the other room?
"
,,
3,19," Yeah, go. Say it.
"
,,
3,19," Should I?
"
,,
3,19," I can't.
"
,,
3,19," Just say it.
"
,,
3,19,"How far can you get this banana...
"
,,
3,19,"I can't say it. She's looking right at me.
"
,,
3,19,"What the hell is this about?
"
,,
3,19," It's about you and Ross Fishman!
"
,,
3,19," What?!
"
,,
3,19,"I saw you and him breaking
"
,,
3,19,"the Fifth Commandment!
"
,,
3,19,"Congress passes these things for a reason!
"
,,
3,19,"That's it! You're suffocating me
"
,,
3,19,"with your jealousy. I can't take it any more.
"
,,
3,19,"I'm calling a marriage counsellor.
"
,,
3,19,"I can't even have coffee with a friend!
"
,,
3,19," What is your problem?!
"
,,
3,19," You want to know what my problem is?
"
,,
3,19," I love too much!
"
,,
3,19," What are you talking about?
"
,,
3,19," Don't you see? We're alive!
"
,,
3,19," You're scaring me.
"
,,
3,19,"Good! Embrace the fear! Dance with me,
"
,,
3,19,"Lois. Dance the dance of life!
"
,,
3,19,"Maybe you should call that counsellor.
"
,,
3,19,"Mr and Mrs Griffin,
"
,,
3,19,"I've reviewed your situation.
"
,,
3,19," I have a suggestion.
"
,,
3,19," We'll do whatever it takes.
"
,,
3,19,"I'd like to put video cameras
"
,,
3,19,"in every room of your house

"

3,19," OK.
"

3,19,"Chris, I'm watching the game.
"

3,19,"You know what to do.
"

3,19,"Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

3,19,"No. It's step, hip, step, pivot.

3,19,"Are you trying to piss off the volcano?

3,19,"Get my back, would you?

3,19,"Oh, that's it. Ooh, that feels good.

"

3,19,"Gotcha.
"
,,
3,19,"To be honest, I've never seen
"

3,19,"such dysfunction.
"
,,
3,19,"Mr and Mrs Griffin, what I'm about
"
,,
3,19,"to suggest may seem unorthodox.
"
,,
3,19,"I recommend a trial separation, during which
"
,,
3,19,"time I advise that you date other people.
"
,,
3,19,"I believe this will help you
"

3,19,"gather perspective.
"
,,
3,19," Date other people?!
"
,,
3,19," Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,19,"I realise this is upsetting.
"
,,
3,19,"That's why I've invited Howie Mandel
"
,,
3,19,"to lighten the mood by blowing up
"
,,
3,19,"a surgical glove with his nose.
"
,,
3,19,"This feels really weird, Lois.
"
,,
3,19,"I know. But maybe the doctor's right.
"
,,
3,19,"This time apart could be good for us.
"
,,
3,19,"I don't know. Splitting up didn't work
"
,,
3,19,"too well for Pacman and his wife.
"
,,
3,19," Forget about her.
"
,,
3,19," You're too good for her anyway.
"
,,
3,19," Cheer up, man.
"
,,
3,19," Hey, you want to eat us? Huh?
"
,,
3,19," We're turning blue!
"
,,
3,19," I've got nowhere to run.
"
,,
3,19,"He's gonna get us!
"
,,
3,19," Oh.
"
,,
3,19," Oh.
"
,,
3,19,"He's not budging.
"
,,
3,19,"Come on. Let's go to Qbert's.
"
,,
3,19," I appreciate you putting me up, Cleveland.
"
,,
3,19," Our house is your house, Peter.
"
,,
3,19,"I'd sit here and chat, but I need
"
,,
3,19,"to get back upstairs to Loretta
"
,,
3,19,"because it's our anniversary
"
,,
3,19,"and the getting's good.
"
,,
3,19,"Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
"
,,
3,19,"When is it gonna be my turn?
"
,,
3,19,"Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
"
,,
3,19,"You are welcome to stay
"
,,
3,19,"as long as you like.
"
,,
3,19,"Thanks, Muriel. So, what do you guys
"
,,
3,19,"do for fun around here?
"
,,
3,19,"We like to watch old movies
"
,,
3,19,"while listening to ""Hotel California""
"
,,
3,19,"to see if it syncs up in a significant way.
"
,,
3,19,"And so far, no. Nothing has.
"
,,
3,19," Hello?
"
,,
3,19," Is Peter there?
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, hi, Quagmire. No, Peter's not home.
"
,,
3,19,"We're... we're having
"
,,
3,19,"some minor marital problems.
"
,,
3,19,"Our therapist has advised us
"
,,
3,19,"to date other people.
"
,,
3,19," Hey, Lois, you want to go out?
"
,,
3,19," What? I don't know, Glen.
"
,,
3,19,"Peter and I just separated.
"
,,
3,19,"I feel like I need more time.
"
,,
3,19," How about now?
"
,,
3,19," We are supposed to see other people.
"
,,
3,19,"I guess it's better to go out
"
,,
3,19,"with you than some sex pervert.
"
,,
3,19,"I'm in! Giggetty-gaggety-gaggety-goo!
"
,,
3,19,"Oh. God blast it!
"
,,
3,19,"Will you hold it for five seconds?!
"
,,
3,19,"OK.
"
,,
3,19,"So, Mr Griffin, how does it feel
"
,,
3,19,"to be a bachelor on the prowl again?
"
,,
3,19,"It's not as great as you'd think. I don't have
"
,,
3,19,"the same way with women that I used to.
"
,,
3,19,"That was nice. That was nice.
"
,,
3,19,"I had a great time with you today,
"
,,
3,19,"beautiful stranger. What's your sign?
"
,,
3,19,"Gross. I still think
"
,,
3,19,"you're neat, though.
"
,,
3,19,"You should try a video dating service.
"
,,
3,19,"That's how Muriel and I met.
"
,,
3,19,"Let me show you Mort's tape.
"
,,
3,19,"He was so charming.
"
,,
3,19,"Agh! Oh, my eyes! Could you please
"
,,
3,19,"turn down that very bright light?
"
,,
3,19,"It's burning my retinas.
"
,,
3,19,"Ladies, I'm a very desperate man.
"
,,
3,19,"My name is Mort and I live with my mother.
"
,,
3,19,"And I have very low standards.
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, God!
"
,,
3,19,"There's blood in my mucus!
"
,,
3,19,"Agh! What the hell is wrong with you?!
"
,,
3,19,"Hey, there's the mail! Oh, finally.
"
,,
3,19,"It takes an hour for the solvent to take effect.
"
,,
3,19,"What takes an hour? We could watch
"
,,
3,19,"Rita Rudner do five minutes of stand-up.
"
,,
3,19,"Ba-zing.
"
,,
3,19,"We're gonna have a swell time tonight, Lois.
"
,,
3,19,"Thank you for being such a good friend
"
,,
3,19,"and looking after me.
"
,,
3,19,"No problem. It's chilly out,
"
,,
3,19,"so I brought you a jacket.
"
,,
3,19," Oh. No, thanks. I'll be fine.
"
,,
3,19," Please?
"
,,
3,19,"Muriel and I feel that you need to follow
"
,,
3,19,"your therapist's advice and start dating.
"
,,
3,19," Jeez, Mort. I don't know if I'm ready.
"
,,
3,19," Come on, stud.
"
,,
3,19,"We've set it up for you
"
,,
3,19,"to go out with our niece.
"
,,
3,19,"Honey! Come on out here
"
,,
3,19,"and meet Peter Griffin.
"
,,
3,19,"This is our niece, Jennifer Love Hewitt.
"
,,
3,19," Nice to meet you.
"
,,
3,19," All right, I'm getting up.
"
,,
3,19,"Hi. Peter Griffin. We can go anywhere except
"
,,
3,19,"the disco. They don't let me in any more.
"
,,
3,19,"Ow! Crafty Mexicans and your glass candy.
"
,,
3,19," What's going on?
"
,,
3,19," There's a girl in that well.
"
,,
3,19," Oh, my God!
"
,,
3,19," Nobody has arms long enough to reach her.
"
,,
3,19,"Except that guy. But he's helping
"
,,
3,19,"that woman tickle a midget.
"
,,
3,19,"Tee-hee. Stop it. Tee-hee.
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, God, you want to rescue her, don't you?
"
,,
3,19,"It's times like this I wish they'd
"
,,
3,19,"used me for stem-cell research.
"
,,
3,19,"Help me!
"
,,
3,19,"It rubs the lotion on its skin,
"
,,
3,19,"or else it gets the hose again. Ha!
"
,,
3,19,"All right, I'm gonna lower you in.
"
,,
3,19,"I just noticed. How often do you see
"
,,
3,19,"a 17th-century well in this day and age?
"
,,
3,19," Hurry up. The glue's wearing off!
"
,,
3,19," All right, all right!
"
,,
3,19,"We're not stuck together any more.
"
,,
3,19," Thank God!
"
,,
3,19," You said it.
"
,,
3,19," Want to hold hands on the walk home?
"
,,
3,19," Sure.
"
,,
3,19,"Susie! Thank God you're all right!
"
,,
3,19,"Wait a minute. This isn't my little girl.
"
,,
3,19,"Hey, that was my wife!
"
,,
3,19," Tee-hee!
"
,,
3,19," Tee-hee!
"
,,
3,19," I Know What You Did Last Summer?
"
,,
3,19," Never heard of it.
"
,,
3,19," The Devil and Daniel Webster?
"
,,
3,19," Nope.
"
,,
3,19," Party of Five?
"
,,
3,19," Was that a porno?
"
,,
3,19,"Sometimes you gotta do a lot of crap
"
,,
3,19,"before they put you in anything decent.
"
,,
3,19,"The food here is fantastic.
"
,,
3,19,"This is where I took Lois on our first date.
"
,,
3,19,"You ordered a pie for an appetiser?
"
,,
3,19,"I'll go to the john and fire one out in five
"
,,
3,19,"minutes. That should make room for dinner.
"
,,
3,19," Here's your table, Mr Quagmire.
"
,,
3,19," Thanks. How about drinks?
"
,,
3,19,"Martini for you and the usual
"
,,
3,19,"roofie colada for your date?
"
,,
3,19,"No, no, no. I wouldn't bring...
"
,,
3,19,"A glass of wine.
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, my God! That's Jennifer Love Hewitt!
"
,,
3,19,"Wow! I wonder who she's here with.
"
,,
3,19,"She could date any man she wanted to.
"
,,
3,19,"There. Made lots of room.
"
,,
3,19,"That sign in the bathroom about washing
"
,,
3,19,"your hands, that's for the staff, right?
"
,,
3,19," Technically, yes.
"
,,
3,19," That's what I thought. Great.
"
,,
3,19,"Oh, man! These all look good,
"
,,
3,19,"every one of 'em.
"
,,
3,19," You want some bread?
"
,,
3,19," No!
"
,,
3,19,"Peter, is that you?
"
,,
3,19,"Peter?! Oh, no! I can't let him see me!
"
,,
3,19,"It's OK, Quagmire. We're just doing
"
,,
3,19,"what the therapist said to do.
"
,,
3,19,"Peter, I think it's great you're out
"
,,
3,19,"with Jennifer Love Hewitt.
"
,,
3,19,"Hi. I loved you in Heartbreakers.
"
,,
3,19,"You be on your best behaviour.
"
,,
3,19," Here you go, sweetheart. Open up.
"
,,
3,19," No!
"
,,
3,19,"There you go. Isn't this romantic?
"
,,
3,19,"That's it! You have got to be the most vile,
"
,,
3,19,"disgusting human being I've ever met!
"
,,
3,19,"And I have never been
"
,,
3,19,"more turned-on in my life.
"
,,
3,19,"Hold on, toots!
"
,,
3,19,"I don't care what our therapist says.
"
,,
3,19,"I won't stand by and watch my husband
"
,,
3,19,"lock lips with another woman! Beat it!
"
,,
3,19," What's your problem, grandma?
"
,,
3,19," You are!
"
,,
3,19,"And I only saw Heartbreakers on a plane!
"
,,
3,19,"And the flight was delayed,
"
,,
3,19,"so the headphones were free!
"
,,
3,19,"Wow. That was pretty cool, Lois.
"

3,19,"I guess I finally understand...
"
,,
3,19,"You better run, you little bitch!
"
,,
3,19,"I guess I finally understand
"
,,
3,19,"how you can get so jealous sometimes.
"
,,
3,19,"Seeing her kiss you like that
"

3,19,"just made me crazy.
"

3,19,"I guess we're gonna have to learn
"

3,19,"to control our jealousy... together.

3,19,"Here's your drink, sir.

,,
3,20," Do you want me to sign the left or right?
"
,,
3,20," No, no, no. It's Lois. Lois Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
3,20,"I knew you before you changed your name.
"
,,
3,20,"Lois! I don't believe it! It's been ages!

3,20,"I've never been more wrong in my life.

"
,,
3,20,"are just... What is it you've drawn here?
"
,,
3,20,"It's Oswald Owl slammin'
"
,,
3,20,"Mother Maggie in a Chinese basket, eh?
"
,,
3,20,"Dead brill, eh?
"
,,
3,20," Mother Maggie, something's terribly wrong!
"
,,
3,20," Whose stinky brat is this?
"
,,
3,20,"That's not your voice! Your voice
"
,,
3,20,"is lyrical, like the strum of a lute!
"
,,
3,20,"Piss off, ya grotty little wanker!
"
,,
3,20," It's a fake! It's not real!
"
,,
3,20," I thought you should find out on your own.
"
,,
3,20,"I feel like such a fool. Don't even look at me!
"
,,
3,20,"Hey, come on. You wanna get some
"
,,
3,20,"ice cream? That'd make you feel better, right?
"
,,
3,20,"You wanna get some McDonald's?
"
,,
3,20,"You wanna take a dump
"
,,
3,20,"in Mother Maggie's shoes?
"
,,
3,20,"OK, let's go take a dump
"
,,
3,20,"in Mother Maggie's shoes.
"
,,
3,20," Jolly Farm, Stewie. Don't you wanna watch?
"
,,
3,20," The Stewie who loved Jolly Farm is dead.
"
,,
3,20,"Meet the Stewie who loves funky fruit hats!
"
,,
3,20,"Oh, turn it up! Mom and Dad are on!
"
,,
3,20,"We're back with KISS Forum. I'm with the
"
,,
3,20,"Griffins, and they got something to share.
"
,,
3,20," Yeah. My wife here did KISS.
"
,,
3,20," Get outta here!
"
,,
3,20," Hand to God.
"
,,
3,20," Peter! How does that make you feel?
"
,,
3,20,"I feel like I've done KISS, too.
"
,,
3,20,"And it feels good.
"
,,
3,20,"Lois, you got any tips for
"
,,
3,20,"the young girls in the audience?
"
,,
3,20,"The best advice I can give is,
"
,,
3,20,"you never know who's gonna grow up
"
,,
3,20,"to be famous, so make yourself available.
"
,,
3,20,"Cool. Well, that's our show for tonight.
"
,,
3,20,"Stay tuned for Battlestar Galactica Forum.
"
,,
3,20,"Welcome to Battlestar Galactica Forum.
"
,,
3,21," Hi, I'm Brian Griffin.
"
,,
3,21," I'm Stewart.
"
,,
3,21,"Many of you have written in
"
,,
3,21,"with suggestions for episodes.
"
,,
3,21,"They're mostly God-awful.
"
,,
3,21,"Well, we've produced
"
,,
3,21,"three of our favourite suggestions.
"
,,
3,21,"Favourites? That's charitable.
"
,,
3,21,"What is that?
"
,,
3,21," It's from Dharma and Greg.
"
,,
3,21," I'm surprised it still works.
"
,,
3,21," Whoa!
"
,,
3,21," Enjoy.
"
,,
3,21,"""It seems today that all you see
"
,,
3,21,"""Is violence in movies and sex on TV

,,
3,21,"""But where are those

3,21,"""The last thing I would ever
"
,,
3,21,"give my wife is... blank""?
"
,,
3,21,"A little spending money?

"
,,
3,21,"""the antidote"".
"
,,
3,21," Nick, what are you talking abou...?
"
,,
3,21," Oh, Meg, you were right.
"
,,
3,21," Oh, my God! A genie!
"
,,
3,21," I am here to grant you three wishes.
"
,,
3,21," Peter, three wishes! This is so exciting!
"
,,
3,21," I want a new hat!
"
,,
3,21," I want a new hat!
"
,,
3,21," I want them to have new hats!
"
,,
3,21,"Kids, these are your father's wishes.
"
,,
3,21,"Get whatever you want.
"
,,
3,21,"That's easy. I wish I could see
"
,,
3,21,"what Kelly Ripa was like off the set.
"
,,
3,21,"So it shall be.
"
,,
3,21," Great show today, Kelly.
"
,,
3,21," Thanks. You, too.
"
,,
3,21,"Gelman needs us onstage
"
,,
3,21,"for a couple of reshoots.
"
,,
3,21,"Be right there. I have to put on my face.
"
,,
3,21,"Did you see the size of that dressing room?
"
,,
3,21," They must really want to keep her.
"
,,
3,21," Your second wish?
"
,,
3,21,"I gotjust the thing.
"
,,
3,21,"I wish I had my own theme music.
"
,,
3,21,"Done!
"
,,
3,21," I don't hear anything.
"
,,
3,21," Get up. Try it out.
"
,,
3,21,"Sweet!
"
,,
3,21,"Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah!
"
,,
3,21,"Hey, wanna turn that stuff down?
"
,,
3,21,"Come on, that's classic travelling music.
"
,,
3,21,"Try to enjoy it.
"
,,
3,21,"""Riding on a bus, riding on a bus,
"
,,
3,21,"sitting next to bums
"
,,
3,21,"""There's an open seat, hope that isn't pee
"
,,
3,21," I'm sick of hearing it!
"
,,
3,21," I'm sorry, buddy, I can't turn it off.
"
,,
3,21,"Then I'm gonna break
"
,,
3,21,"every bone in your body.
"
,,
3,21," I wish I had no bones!
"
,,
3,21," Done.
"
,,
3,21,"That ought to show you!
"
,,
3,21,"Oh, no. I gotta fart,
"
,,
3,21,"but I don't know which way to lean.
"
,,
3,21,"I know you might be a little concerned
"
,,
3,21,"about me not having bones,
"
,,
3,21,"but I gotta tell you, it's not that bad.
"
,,
3,21,"Dad's just like Silly Putty.
"
,,
3,21,"Look what I can do to Mary Worth's
"
,,
3,21,"smug sense of self-satisfaction.
"
,,
3,21,"That's right, son. Take her down a peg.
"
,,
3,21,"I guess we could all adjust to this.
"
,,
3,21," Look! I'm making an angel!
"
,,
3,21," See? Everything's gonna be fine.
"
,,
3,21,"Now smile while I write
"
,,
3,21,"my name in you.
"
,,
3,21,"Argh! Argh!
"
,,
3,21,"Let go!
"
,,
3,21,"Aagh!
"
,,
3,21,"But, Mom, I've got to
"
,,
3,21,"use the bathroom now!
"
,,
3,21,"Your father gets incredibly filthy
"
,,
3,21,"rolling around everywhere.
"
,,
3,21," He has to take 12 baths a day.
"
,,
3,21," I don't like Dad any more.
"
,,
3,21,"I invited some friends over
"
,,
3,21,"to jump on him like a trampoline,
"
,,
3,21,"but his roll of fat sucked up Ryan's shoe
"
,,
3,21,"and his mom yelled at him
"
,,
3,21,"when he got home
"
,,
3,21,"and he beat me up at school the next day!
"
,,
3,21,"It's all here in this pamphlet.
"
,,
3,21,"We have to learn to accept this,
"
,,
3,21,"like one of those stories on Dateline
"
,,
3,21,"where a family member suffers a horrible
"
,,
3,21,"accident and is a burden on everybody.
"
,,
3,21,"They pretend to be happy,
"
,,
3,21,"but they're dead inside. They're dead.
"
,,
3,21,"And that'll be our lives, hm?
"
,,
3,21,"What a big, boneless jerk I am.
"
,,
3,21,"I might've screwed up my life but there's
"
,,
3,21,"no reason to keep screwing up theirs.
"
,,
3,21,"Goodbye, cruel bone-filled world!
"
,,
3,21,"Oh, so this is where
"
,,
3,21,"all the waste and sewage winds up.
"
,,
3,21,"Aaaargh!
"
,,
3,21,"Cut and print. That's a wrap.
"
,,
3,21,"Greatjob, Peter.
"
,,
3,21," Coming to the wrap party?
"
,,
3,21," I don't know.
"
,,
3,21,"I got a stand-up comedy class
"
,,
3,21,"at The Learning Annex.
"
,,
3,21,"Actually, I won't be a stand-up comic.
"
,,
3,21,"I'll be more like an amorphous-blob comic.
"
,,
3,21," I gotta write that down.
"
,,
3,21," Nonsense!
"
,,
3,21,"I'll have the studio send a flatbed for you!
"
,,
3,21,"See you at eight!
"
,,
3,21,"There's something
"
,,
3,21,"I've wanted to say all evening.
"
,,
3,21,"What's that,
"
,,
3,21,"Mrs Catherine Zeta-Jones Douglas?
"
,,
3,21," I want to jump your non-bones.
"
,,
3,21," Jeez, I can't believe I'm your type.
"
,,
3,21,"As you can tell from my husband,
"
,,
3,21,"I've got a thing for saggy, shapeless men.
"
,,
3,21,"I'm married to Catherine Zeta-Jones.
"
,,
3,21,"Will you sleep with me?
"
,,
3,21,"I'll have to pass.
"
,,
3,21,"But Louie Anderson's eating the decorative
"
,,
3,21,"soaps in the bathroom. Why not try him?
"
,,
3,21," Aren't you Peter, the human stunt bag?
"
,,
3,21," That depends on who's asking.
"
,,
3,21,"I'm a doctor doing an experimental procedure
"
,,
3,21,"to give bones to ajellyfish,
"
,,
3,21,"but I'd like to try it on a human. Interested?
"
,,
3,21," I don't know.
"
,,
3,21," Interested?
"
,,
3,21,"Didn't you just say that? I'll do it!
"
,,
3,21,"The operation was a complete success!
"
,,
3,21,"What are you going to do now?
"
,,
3,21,"I had the operation
"
,,
3,21,"so I could go back to my family.
"
,,
3,21,"It's been so long.
"
,,
3,21,"What if they don't love me any more?
"
,,
3,21,"Where do you think
"
,,
3,21,"all those bones came from?
"
,,
3,21," Surprise!
"
,,
3,21," My God!
"
,,
3,21,"You mean it's your bones that are inside me?
"
,,
3,21,"Mostly. We picked up
"
,,
3,21,"a drifter to fill in the torso.
"
,,
3,21,"Like I always say, a family of freaks
"
,,
3,21,"is better than no family at all!
"
,,
3,21,"Let's go home! You know what's weird?
"
,,
3,21,"This was covered by my HMO.
"
,,
3,21,"You dare me to pop a wheelie in this thing?
"
,,
3,21,"That doesn't sound safe at all.
"
,,
3,21,"OK, I dare you.
"
,,
3,21,"Wow! That was great!
"
,,
3,21,"Six! Six bats.
"
,,
3,21,"Seven! Seven bats!
"
,,
3,21," Is the Count a vampire?
"
,,
3,21," What's that?
"
,,
3,21,"Those big fangs. Have they ever shown him
"
,,
3,21,"do somebody in, then feed on him?
"
,,
3,21,"You're asking if they've
"
,,
3,21,"done a Sesame Street
"
,,
3,21,"in which the Count kills somebody,
"
,,
3,21,"then sucks their blood for sustenance?
"
,,
3,21," Yeah.
"
,,
3,21," No.
"
,,
3,21,"There's something out in the yard!
"
,,
3,21," It looks like the back of a tanker truck.
"
,,
3,21," Wow! What do you think's inside?
"
,,
3,21," Maybe it's candy!
"
,,
3,21," Chris, no!
"
,,
3,21,"Lois, Lois. Let him dream.
"
,,
3,21," Eugh! What is this stuff?
"
,,
3,21," It's some kind of nuclear waste.
"
,,
3,21,"Dear me.
"
,,
3,21,"Does anyone else feel a trifle queasy?
"
,,
3,21,"What? Do I have a boogie? I say!
"
,,
3,21,"It appears my cranium has doubled in size!
"
,,
3,21,"How delightful! This toxic stew seems
"
,,
3,21,"to have given me telekinetic abilities!
"
,,
3,21,"Hey! I can make fire!
"
,,
3,21,"Come here a second.
"
,,
3,21,"This is gonna be hilarious.
"
,,
3,21,"OK, on the count of three. One, two, three...
"
,,
3,21,"Do it again!
"
,,
3,21,"All right. Clearly something
"
,,
3,21,"very strange has happened here.
"
,,
3,21,"We've each acquired superpowers
"
,,
3,21,"from that nuclear waste.
"
,,
3,21,"We've been given a gift.
"
,,
3,21,"Whether that gift is Chris's fire conjuring,
"
,,
3,21,"Stewie's telekinesis, Brian's superspeed...
"
,,
3,21," Ask how the queen of England is.
"
,,
3,21," How's...
"
,,
3,21," She's great.
"
,,
3,21,"... Peter's morphing ability...
"
,,
3,21,"Hey, Lois, I'm a wishing troll.
"
,,
3,21,"...my superstrength,
"
,,
3,21,"or Meg's, um... super-amazing
"
,,
3,21,"ability to grow her fingernails,
"
,,
3,21,"we must to use these powers properly
"
,,
3,21,"and not abuse them for personal gain.
"
,,
3,21," Understand?
"
,,
3,21," Yes.
"
,,
3,21," Mm-hm.
"
,,
3,21," Got it.
"
,,
3,21,"Oh, no. I forgot the detergent. Excuse me,
"
,,
3,21,"would you watch him for a moment?
"
,,
3,21,"Sure thing, ma'am.
"
,,
3,21,"Whoa there, little guy. You gotta pay for that.
"
,,
3,21,"Go suck a railroad spike. I have no money.
"
,,
3,21,"Then I'm afraid I'm gonna
"
,,
3,21,"have to take it away from you.
"
,,
3,21,"Argh! Argh! Argh!
"
,,
3,21,"Oh, God! Please help me!
"
,,
3,21,"Move it, you slowpoke, the light's green!
"
,,
3,21,"What does that cloud look like to you,
"
,,
3,21,"honey? To me it looks like... rain.
"
,,
3,21,"I used thatjoke at work today.
"
,,
3,21,"I'm the funniest guy at the office.
"
,,
3,21," They say I should do stand-up.
"
,,
3,21," Oh! This is insane!
"
,,
3,21,"Oh, my God, *NSync is in town.
"
,,
3,21,"If you get me a lock of Justin's hair,
"
,,
3,21,"I'll never ask you
"
,,
3,21,"for shopping money again. Please?!
"
,,
3,21,"We promised Lois
"
,,
3,21,"we'd use our powers responsibly.
"
,,
3,21,"I suppose doing the exact opposite
"
,,
3,21,"couldn't hurt.
"
,,
3,21," Hey, do you want to split a Toblerone?
"
,,
3,21," Oh, gosh! Yeah. I think I do.
"
,,
3,21,"Whoo-whoo! Next stop, my thighs!
"
,,
3,21,"All right, Meg, wait here. I'll be right back.
"
,,
3,21,"Hi. Britney Spears. You mind if I go in?
"
,,
3,21," Oh, not at all, Miss Spears.
"
,,
3,21," Oh, call me Peter.
"
,,
3,21," Hey, fellas.
"
,,
3,21," Britney? What are you doing here?
"
,,
3,21,"I was in the neighbourhood -
"
,,
3,21,"I'm gonna steal one of your beers -
"
,,
3,21,"and I figured I'd stop by and say hi.
"
,,
3,21,"You mind if I have a seat?
"
,,
3,21," I am out of shape. I got a favour to ask you.
"
,,
3,21," What is it?
"
,,
3,21,"I got a hole in my car's muffler.
"
,,
3,21,"I need to plug it.
"
,,
3,21," Can I have some of your hair?
"
,,
3,21," I guess so.
"
,,
3,21,"Oh, great. Thanks. All right, hold still now.
"
,,
3,21,"You'll be fine. Give me a kiss.
"
,,
3,21," Agh!
"
,,
3,21," I'm Gene Shalit now! Bye!
"
,,
3,21," Here's your martini.
"
,,
3,21," Thanks.
"
,,
3,21," Hey, it's gone!
"
,,
3,21," I'm sorry, ma'am. Here's another one.
"
,,
3,21,"What the hell is going on here?
"
,,
3,21,"Hi. Can I get some pretzels or something?
"
,,
3,21,"I gotta drive.
"
,,
3,21,"Hey, did you bring enough breasts
"
,,
3,21,"for the rest of the class?
"
,,
3,21,"Hector, how long have we known each other?
"
,,
3,21," Since first grade.
"
,,
3,21," Yeah. Yeah.
"
,,
3,21,"You remember that time
"
,,
3,21,"you called me ""Chris Gristle""?
"
,,
3,21," I think so.
"
,,
3,21," Well, burn for it!
"
,,
3,21,"It's a bird, it's a plane,
"
,,
3,21,"it's a lower-middle-class Irish family.
"
,,
3,21,"This is just one of
"
,,
3,21,"many public disturbances
"
,,
3,21,"caused by the Griffin family of Quahog,
"
,,
3,21,"who seem to have acquired superpowers.
"
,,
3,21,"Very strange story, Diane.
"
,,
3,21,"Coming up next: Can bees think?
"
,,
3,21,"A new study confirms that no, they cannot.
"
,,
3,21,"Citizens of Quahog, we have a problem!
"
,,
3,21,"You're damn right! Peter stole my hair!
"
,,
3,21," Settle down, Jeffrey!
"
,,
3,21," Justin.
"
,,
3,21,"Mike. Clearly the Griffin family
"
,,
3,21,"is out of control, but not to fear.
"
,,
3,21,"I've tangled with superbeings before.
"
,,
3,21,"They can be stopped!
"
,,
3,21,"You can't stop us, Mayor West!
"
,,
3,21,"We are all-powerful!
"
,,
3,21,"Clearly you've let yourselves
"
,,
3,21,"become drunk with power.
"
,,
3,21,"Silence!
"
,,
3,21," We demand obedience!
"
,,
3,21," Or else!
"
,,
3,21,"Is that all you can do?
"
,,
3,21,"Ow! That kinda hurt!
"
,,
3,21,"Is that bleeding?
"
,,
3,21,"I guess it's all right. Ouch, though!
"
,,
3,21,"Anyone who opposes our demands
"
,,
3,21,"will be destroyed!
"
,,
3,21,"Our first demand:
"
,,
3,21,"You will erect a statue in the town square.
"
,,
3,21,"It will depict Blair Warner admitting to
"
,,
3,21,"Mrs Garrett that the poem she submitted
"
,,
3,21,"for her creative writing class was
"
,,
3,21,"plagiarised from a work by Emily Dickinson.
"
,,
3,21,"We have spoken! Agh!
"
,,
3,21,"That's it! We have to fight fire with fire.
"
,,
3,21,"If nuclear refuse gave them superpowers,
"
,,
3,21,"it could do the same for me.
"
,,
3,21,"Citizens, I'm off to the toxic waste dump!
"
,,
3,21," Mayor West, you have lymphoma.
"
,,
3,21," Oh, my!
"
,,
3,21,"Probably from rolling around in toxic waste.
"
,,
3,21," I see.
"
,,
3,21," What were you trying to prove?
"
,,
3,21," I was trying to gain superpowers.
"
,,
3,21," That's just silly.
"
,,
3,21,"Silly, yes. Idiotic, yes.
"
,,
3,21,"No, no! That's not what Mrs Garrett's
"
,,
3,21,"bosom looked like. It looked more like this.
"
,,
3,21,"Notice the sun spots
"
,,
3,21,"at the top of the right can.
"
,,
3,21,"Excuse me. I have a message
"
,,
3,21,"from the Quahog hospital.
"
,,
3,21," I just feel awful about this, Mayor West.
"
,,
3,21," Yeah. Me, too. Stewie, fluff his pillows.
"
,,
3,21,"I'll heat up his soup.
"
,,
3,21,"I'll go to China to see if there's a cure.
"
,,
3,21,"Nope.
"
,,
3,21,"Now, now. The doctor says I'll make
"
,,
3,21,"a full recovery. But you learned your lesson.
"
,,
3,21,"I can't believe we let those superpowers
"
,,
3,21,"go to our heads.
"
,,
3,21," I feel like such a bastard.
"
,,
3,21," Me, too.
"
,,
3,21,"For now, we'll use our powers
"
,,
3,21,"to help you get better.
"
,,
3,21,"Thank you. As long as I have Mrs Garrett's
"
,,
3,21,"giant rack by my bedside, I'll be all right.
"
,,
3,21,"Girls! Girls! Girls!
"
,,
3,21,"Hear ye, hear ye. I call to order the
"
,,
3,21,"first meeting of the We Hate Broads Club.
"
,,
3,21," Yeah!
"
,,
3,21," Cos all you need in life is your best pals.
"
,,
3,21," Sure! As long as those pals ain't dames!
"
,,
3,21," O-tay!
"
,,
3,21,"What was that?
"
,,
3,21,"Hey! We told you guys
"
,,
3,21,"to quit snooping around here!
"
,,
3,21,"We need to find a story
"
,,
3,21,"if I'm ever gonna be a big-time reporter.
"
,,
3,21,"All right, make like Siamese twins
"
,,
3,21,"and split... and then one of you die.
"
,,
3,21,"When do we have the grape juice?
"
,,
3,21,"I came for grape juice.
"
,,
3,21,"Hey, Quagmire, watch this.
"
,,
3,21,"Hey, ""kick me""!
"
,,
3,21,"We have a new studentjoining us this
"
,,
3,21,"morning. Her name is Lois Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
3,21," Ugh! Just what we need, another girl.
"
,,
3,21," You said it!
"
,,
3,21,"Wow! I'd like to play doctor with her!
"
,,
3,21,"And remove her inflamed appendix
"
,,
3,21,"before it bursts, causing sepsis.
"
,,
3,21,"Giggidy-giggidy-giggidy!
"
,,
3,21," What you reading?
"
,,
3,21," The Red Badge of Courage.
"
,,
3,21,"I sure wish I could meet a brave fella
"
,,
3,21,"like the guy in this book.
"
,,
3,21," You know, I'm a brave guy, Lois.
"
,,
3,21," You're not brave enough to laugh at death!
"
,,
3,21,"Watch me!
"
,,
3,21,"Thanks! Like I don't have
"
,,
3,21,"enough trouble fitting in!
"
,,
3,21,"You're not brave enough
"
,,
3,21,"to take your clothes off!
"
,,
3,21,"Way ahead of you. Oh!
"
,,
3,21,"I bet you're too chicken
"
,,
3,21,"to spend a night at the old Selberg place.
"
,,
3,21," Cleveland, mind stepping out of the way?
"
,,
3,21," Oh, sorry.
"
,,
3,21,"I ain't chicken to spend the night!
"
,,
3,21,"I ain't neither!
"
,,
3,21,"To prove it, I'll go up there tonight!
"
,,
3,21," See you there, pal!
"
,,
3,21," You can't stay in that house!
"
,,
3,21,"Old man Selberg's ghost still haunts it.
"
,,
3,21,"Not to mention the myriad
"
,,
3,21,"of bacteria and allergens
"
,,
3,21,"from years of substandard housekeeping.
"
,,
3,21,"It does not augur well for you.
"
,,
3,21,"Aw, zip it, egghead.
"
,,
3,21,"You with your big words and your...
"
,,
3,21,"and your small difficult words.
"
,,
3,21,"Wow! Any boy who would
"
,,
3,21,"spend the night in that creepy place
"
,,
3,21,"sure would be the bravest fella I ever met.
"
,,
3,21,"That Lois is some kind of woman.
"
,,
3,21,"Yeah. Just thinking about her
"
,,
3,21,"makes my testicles want to drop.
"
,,
3,21,"Oops, speak of the devil.
"
,,
3,21,"Ooh. Make that devils.
"
,,
3,21,"Quagmire's team takes the left side of the
"
,,
3,21,"house and Peter's team will take the right.
"
,,
3,21,"Whoever's alive in the morning
"
,,
3,21,"can bury his dead pals.
"
,,
3,21,"Do I have a cobweb in my hair?
"
,,
3,21,"It feels like I have a cobweb in my hair.
"
,,
3,21," What was that?
"
,,
3,21," Michael Winslow from Police Academy.
"
,,
3,21," This house gives me the creeps.
"
,,
3,21," Yeah, let's get out of here.
"
,,
3,21,"Wait, wait. We can't let those guys win.
"
,,
3,21," We ought to pretend we're ghosts, see?
"
,,
3,21," Then we'll scare the other guys out...
"
,,
3,21,"We say we spent the night
"
,,
3,21,"and everyone thinks
"
,,
3,21,"we're the bravest kids in the world.
"
,,
3,21,"Especially Lois.
"
,,
3,21,"All right!
"
,,
3,21,"Hey, I got a great idea!
"
,,
3,21,"This'll really scare them. Everybody set?
"
,,
3,21," Check!
"
,,
3,21," Check!
"
,,
3,21,"Sock it to me!
"
,,
3,21,"If we had a teacup, this would be like
"
,,
3,21,"playing find the teacup in the bedsheet,
"
,,
3,21,"like I do with my Aunt Sophia.
"
,,
3,21,"Aaaagh!
"
,,
3,21,"My God! Not only are ghosts real,
"
,,
3,21,"but their innards are made of children.
"
,,
3,21,"It's us!
"
,,
3,21,"Whoo-oo-oo!
"
,,
3,21," That's a nice effect!
"
,,
3,21," Yeah, that's really scary,
"
,,
3,21,"Wait a second. If you're there, and I'm here,
"
,,
3,21,"and Istanbul is in this general area,
"
,,
3,21,"then who the hell is that?
"
,,
3,21,"Ha! Get used to this sight, Diane:
"
,,
3,21,"Guys running away from you.
"
,,
3,21,"You're so deep in the closet
"
,,
3,21,"you're finding Christmas presents.
"
,,
3,21,"Remember our story:
"
,,
3,21,"We tell Lois we both stayed all night.
"
,,
3,21,"And I caught the ghost with my lasso.
"
,,
3,21,"I punched him so hard
"
,,
3,21,"he ran crying all the way back to hell!
"
,,
3,21,"She'll have to believe that.
"
,,
3,21,"It hangs together perfectly.
"
,,
3,21,"Our top story: Cowardly kids
"
,,
3,21,"lay down rubber at the old Selberg place.
"
,,
3,21,"Turn that up.
"
,,
3,21,"Peter Griffin and Glen Quagmire
"
,,
3,21,"were seen bolting
"
,,
3,21,"out of the supposedly haunted house
"
,,
3,21,"after one half-hour,
"
,,
3,21,"leaving only their pride
"
,,
3,21,"and twin trails of urine behind them.
"
,,
3,21,"Cheese and crackers!
"
,,
3,21,"Now Lois'll know everything!
"
,,
3,21,"Not if I can help it!
"
,,
3,21," Newsroom.
"
,,
3,21," This is Peter Griffin.
"
,,
3,21,"Stop saying that stuff
"
,,
3,21,"or we'll watch something else!
"
,,
3,21,"Today on The View:
"
,,
3,21,"Cooties, the silent killer.
"
,,
3,21,"Lois, there's something we gotta tell you.
"
,,
3,21,"Yeah. We didn't stay in the haunted house.
"
,,
3,21,"We're not brave.
"
,,
3,21," I've decided I don't care about bravery.
"
,,
3,21," You don't?
"
,,
3,21,"No. I realised what I really like is smarts.
"
,,
3,21,"Sorry I'm late, darling.
"
,,
3,21,"I was checking my stool for blood.
"
,,
3,21," Mort Goldman!
"
,,
3,21," He's so clever! Show 'em, Morty!
"
,,
3,21,"Whoo-oo-oo!
"
,,
3,21,"He got us again!
"
,,
3,21,"This just shows that
"
,,
3,21,"women are nothing but trouble!
"
,,
3,21,"You said it! Let's you and me
"
,,
3,21,"swear off 'em for good!
"
,,
3,21,"And how!
"
,,
3,21,"Quagmire, it seems to me we've each
"
,,
3,21,"made another 500 million dollars.
"
,,
3,21,"Good thing we swore off women
"
,,
3,21,"so we could accumulate this vast wealth.
"
,,
3,21,"Watch the ticker. I'll go microwave
"
,,
3,21,"a bagel and have sex with it.
"
,,
3,21,"Butter's in the fridge!
"
,,
3,22,"It seems today that all you see
"
,,
3,22,"Is violence in movies and sex on TV
"
,,
3,22,"But where are those
"
,,
3,22,"good old-fashioned values
"
,,
3,22,"On which we used to rely?
"
,,
3,22,"Lucky there's a family guy
"
,,
3,22,"Lucky there's a man who positively
"
,,
3,22,"can do all the things that make us
"
,,
3,22,"Laugh and cry
"
,,
3,22,"He's a family guy
"
,,
3,22,"Dad, can you help me with my math?
"
,,
3,22,"Mr Shackleford says if I don't learn it
"
,,
3,22,"I won't be able to function in the real world.
"
,,
3,22,"OK, you gotta go down the road
"
,,
3,22,"past the old Johnson place.
"
,,
3,22,"You're gonna find two roads,
"
,,
3,22,"one parallel and one perpendicular.
"
,,
3,22,"Keep goin' until you come to a highway
"
,,
3,22,"that bisects it at a 45-degree angle.
"
,,
3,22,"Solve for X.
"
,,
3,22,"Maths. Huh!
"
,,
3,22,"Math, my dear boy, is nothing more
"
,,
3,22,"than the lesbian sister of biology.
"
,,
3,22," Hello, sir.
"
,,
3,22," Enough foreplay. What you sellin'?
"
,,
3,22,"Well, I was gonna try to sell you
"
,,
3,22,"some Handsome Cream,
"
,,
3,22,"but I can see you already
"
,,
3,22,"bought out the store.
"
,,
3,22," Go on.
"
,,
3,22," So perhaps you'd be interested
"
,,
3,22,"in something every homeowner
"
,,
3,22,"cannot be without: volcano insurance.
"
,,
3,22," Go on.
"
,,
3,22," According to my uncle,
"
,,
3,22,"who's a real whiz with volcanos,
"
,,
3,22,"a volcano is coming this way.
"
,,
3,22,"Hm. I too have an uncle.
"
,,
3,22,"Come in.
"
,,
3,22," How much is this volcano insurance?
"
,,
3,22," I-I don't know. Let's say $200.
"
,,
3,22,"$200?! That's more than I spent on
"
,,
3,22,"all that Handsome Cream. I don't have it.
"
,,
3,22," What about that jar of money?
"
,,
3,22," No way. That's Lois's rainy-day fund.
"
,,
3,22," Come on. It never rains in Rhode Island.
"
,,
3,22," Yeah, but we've never had a volcano either.
"
,,
3,22,"Well, don't you think we're overdue for one?
"
,,
3,22,"Touch, salesman.
"
,,
3,22," Agh! What the hell are you doing?!
"
,,
3,22," Watching you sleep, cutie-pie.
"
,,
3,22,"Why, you sick, sick little moo-cow!
"
,,
3,22,"You shall watch no more!
"
,,
3,22," Stewie!
"
,,
3,22," My glasses! I can't see a thing!
"
,,
3,22," Why won't you let me get laser surgery?
"
,,
3,22," I just don't think it's safe.
"
,,
3,22,"OK, just a quick incision here
"
,,
3,22,"and we should be all done, Mrs Wilson.
"
,,
3,22," Luke, use the Force.
"
,,
3,22," Really? Cos I was just gonna...
"
,,
3,22," Use the Force.
"
,,
3,22," OK.
"
,,
3,22," Are you happy?
"
,,
3,22," I've never been happy.
"
,,
3,22,"Oh, don't worry, honey.
"
,,
3,22,"We'll get you a new pair tomorrow.
"
,,
3,22,"And in the meantime here's a vision test.
"
,,
3,22,"What is this? A poopy or a Toblerone?
"
,,
3,22,"We now return
"
,,
3,22,"to ""Girlfriends"" on Lifetime.
"
,,
3,22," Barry was over last night, and...
"
,,
3,22," Don't tell me.
"
,,
3,22,"He left the toilet seat up.
"
,,
3,22,"Oh, I ran into Frank. It's funny -
"
,,
3,22,"he fought in Vietnam, he's an exorcist,
"
,,
3,22,"but there is one thing that terrifies him.
"
,,
3,22,"Commitment!
"
,,
3,22,"Oh, Midge. You're my third best friend
"
,,
3,22,"in the whole world.
"
,,
3,22," Third? Who are the first two?
"
,,
3,22," Ben and Jerry.
"
,,
3,22,"Peter, did you take the money
"
,,
3,22,"from the family jar?
"
,,
3,22,"Who, me? Yes, me.
"
,,
3,22,"Couldn't be. Then who?
"
,,
3,22,"Yeah, I did it. I bought volcano insurance.
"
,,
3,22,"Volcano insurance? That's ridiculous.
"
,,
3,22,"That's what you said when you
"
,,
3,22,"talked me out of getting cloud insurance.
"
,,
3,22,"Look at them up there.
"
,,
3,22,"Just plottin'. Picking their moment.
"
,,
3,22,"So, Bill, we attack tomorrow?
"
,,
3,22,"Yes. Tomorrow.
"
,,
3,22," I mean it this time.
"
,,
3,22," I do too.
"
,,
3,22,"Peter, that was our emergency money. And
"
,,
3,22,"your daughter needs a new pair of glasses.
"
,,
3,22," Lois, no one really needs glasses.
"
,,
3,22," You wear glasses.
"
,,
3,22,"That's only to fool the man
"
,,
3,22,"from the draft board.
"
,,
3,22,"I can't believe you squandered that money.
"
,,
3,22,"I swear, sometimes I feel
"
,,
3,22,"like I'm married to a child.
"
,,
3,22,"What can I say about my beautiful bride?
"
,,
3,22,"Except ""Milk, milk, lemonade,
"
,,
3,22,"around the corner fudge is made. ""
"
,,
3,22,"Watch who you're calling a child, because if
"
,,
3,22,"I'm a child, you know what that makes you?
"
,,
3,22,"A paedophile. And I'll be damned if I'm gonna
"
,,
3,22,"stand here and be lectured by a pervert.
"
,,
3,22,"Can you believe it?
"
,,
3,22,"Lois thinks I'm bad with money.
"
,,
3,22,"She's got a point. You're the white version of
"
,,
3,22,"a black guy who's not good with his money.
"
,,
3,22,"Hey-hey, guys and dolls.
"
,,
3,22,"Drinks are on doh-ray-mi.
"
,,
3,22," Where'd you get that?
"
,,
3,22," This is from my stockbroker Ian Greenstein.
"
,,
3,22,"He made some smart investments
"
,,
3,22,"that really paid off.
"
,,
3,22,"That guy is to money
"
,,
3,22,"what Miss Ann-Margret is to...
"
,,
3,22,"Let me buy the drinks, Quagmire.
"
,,
3,22,"My accountant Larry Rosenblat
"
,,
3,22,"just got me a huge tax refund.
"
,,
3,22,"And tickets to Bring In 'Da Noise,
"
,,
3,22,"Bring In 'Da Funk.
"
,,
3,22,"The noise was good, but I thought
"
,,
3,22,"they phoned in a lot of the funk.
"
,,
3,22,"Wait. Rosenblat? Greenstein? You're saying
"
,,
3,22,"I need a Jewish guy to handle my money.
"
,,
3,22,"Peter, not every Jewish person
"
,,
3,22,"is good with money.
"
,,
3,22,"Well, yeah, not the retarded ones,
"
,,
3,22,"but why would you even say that?
"
,,
3,22,"For shock value? Jeez, Cleveland, there's
"
,,
3,22,"edgy and there's offensive. Good day, sir!
"
,,
3,22,"Mother, you know how
"
,,
3,22,"I hate asking for money, but...
"
,,
3,22,"Mother, Peter's an excellent provider.
"
,,
3,22,"No, Mother, I do not think I'd be
"
,,
3,22,"better off married to a chimp.
"
,,
3,22,"I don't care how well that chimp
"
,,
3,22,"across the street is doing.
"
,,
3,22,"Really? Well, yeah, OK,
"
,,
3,22,"I guess you can tell him I said hi.
"
,,
3,22,"But don't make me sound desperate.
"
,,
3,22,"I gotta get a Greenstein or
"
,,
3,22,"a Rosenblat of my very own.
"
,,
3,22,"Nothing else has worked so far
"
,,
3,22,"So I'll wish upon a star
"
,,
3,22,"Wondrous dancing speck of light
"
,,
3,22,"I need a Jew
"
,,
3,22,"Lois makes me take the rap
"
,,
3,22,"Cos our chequebook looks like crap
"
,,
3,22,"Since I can't give her a slap
"
,,
3,22,"I need a Jew
"
,,
3,22,"Where to find
"
,,
3,22,"A baum or stein or stin
"
,,
3,22,"To teach me how to whine
"
,,
3,22,"And do my taxes?
"
,,
3,22,"Though by many they're abhorred
"
,,
3,22,"Hebrew people I've adored
"
,,
3,22,"Even though they killed my Lord
"
,,
3,22,"I need...
"
,,
3,22,"A...
"
,,
3,22,"Jew
"
,,
3,22,"Hi. My name's Max Weinstein. My car
"
,,
3,22,"just broke down. May I use your phone?
"
,,
3,22,"Now my troubles are all through
"
,,
3,22,"I have...
"
,,
3,22,"A...
"
,,
3,22,"Jew
"
,,
3,22,"Hey!
"
,,
3,22,"I prayed for you, Max Weinstein.
"
,,
3,22,"And here you are!
"
,,
3,22,"OK... Listen, uh, thanks for
"
,,
3,22,"letting me use the phone.
"
,,
3,22,"Thanks for Spaceballs.
"
,,
3,22," Well, if there's anything I can do for you...
"
,,
3,22," You can't leave!
"
,,
3,22,"Aaargh!
"
,,
3,22," What do you want?!
"
,,
3,22," Financial advice.
"
,,
3,22,"How the hell did you know
"
,,
3,22,"I'm an accountant?
"
,,
3,22,"Hello?! Max Weinstein?
"
,,
3,22,"I'll try, but I don't know why you
"
,,
3,22,"think I can get your money back.
"
,,
3,22,"Max, Max, Max, let's not deny our heritages.
"
,,
3,22,"You're Jewish; you're good with money.
"
,,
3,22,"I'm Irish; I drink and I ban homosexuals from
"
,,
3,22,"marching in my parade. Now get my money.
"
,,
3,22,"Oh. It's you. Um...
"
,,
3,22,"I'm not in right now.
"
,,
3,22,"Please leave a message. Beep!
"
,,
3,22,"Man, I hate these things. Uh, yeah, hi,
"
,,
3,22,"this is Peter Griffin. Sorry I missed you...
"
,,
3,22,"Peter, play with this. Sir, I reviewed
"
,,
3,22,"this contract and it offers no cover at all.
"
,,
3,22,"It just says ""volcano insurance""
"
,,
3,22,"over and over again.
"
,,
3,22,"And down here in small print it says ""He's
"
,,
3,22,"signing it, he's signing it, I can't believe it. ""
"
,,
3,22,"So?
"
,,
3,22,"Refund this man's money and we'll go.
"
,,
3,22," I don't have your money!
"
,,
3,22," How about that money?
"
,,
3,22,"No way! That's Lois's rainy-day fund!
"
,,
3,22,"Ah, dammit.
"
,,
3,22," You didn't date her cos she was a tickler?
"
,,
3,22," Tickler!
"
,,
3,22," You're not a stickler for a tickler?
"
,,
3,22," Not a stickler.
"
,,
3,22,"Not a tickler stickler?
"
,,
3,22," Tickler stickler ickler...
"
,,
3,22," Ickler tickler...
"
,,
3,22," Where the hell is the remote?
"
,,
3,22," Hey, honey, guess what?
"
,,
3,22," I got back the money for Meg's glasses.
"
,,
3,22," Really?
"
,,
3,22,"Oh, honey! Oh, hello.
"
,,
3,22,"This is my special friend
"
,,
3,22,"Max Weinstein. He's Jewish.
"
,,
3,22," Ooh, my. How exotic.
"
,,
3,22," Thank you...?
"
,,
3,22,"See, here's your rainy-day money,
"
,,
3,22,"and I balanced our chequebook too.
"
,,
3,22," You balanced our chequebook?
"
,,
3,22," Yep. Isn't that right, Max?
"
,,
3,22,"Mm? Oh, yeah, sure. He did it.
"
,,
3,22,"I'm gonna call my mother right now and
"
,,
3,22,"tell her to tell that chimp across the street...
"
,,
3,22,"Look how low I've sunk. Taking credit
"
,,
3,22,"for something a smart Jewish person did.
"
,,
3,22," That's OK, Peter.
"
,,
3,22," People have done that for too damn long!
"
,,
3,22,"It is the white devil that has propagated,
"
,,
3,22,"exacerbated, instigated...
"
,,
3,22,"Instigated... Line?
"
,,
3,22,"Instigated our hatred like a Buick.
"
,,
3,22,"God, what was I thinking
"
,,
3,22,"when I agreed to this?
"
,,
3,22,"This is so degrading. This is worse
"
,,
3,22,"than the time I was at the Friars Club
"
,,
3,22,"and Soon-Yi's retainer fell out of my pants.
"
,,
3,22,"Lois, I appreciate
"
,,
3,22,"the marshmallow and fish casserole,
"
,,
3,22,"but I'm sorry, I can't eat this.
"
,,
3,22,"Oh, because it's not kosher?
"
,,
3,22," Yeah, let's go with that.
"
,,
3,22," Can Stewie and me be excused?
"
,,
3,22," He's gonna help with my math homework.
"
,,
3,22," Chris, he's just a baby.
"
,,
3,22,"Oh, and you're a regular Rhodes scholar
"
,,
3,22,"Where was it you graduated from again?
"
,,
3,22,"Hm? The University of Duhhhh?
"
,,
3,22," I can help you with your homework, son.
"
,,
3,22," God! Is there nothing you people can't do?
"
,,
3,22," I mean, other than manual labour.
"
,,
3,22," Peter! What a ridiculous thing to say.
"
,,
3,22,"They built the pyramids. You'll have to
"
,,
3,22,"excuse Peter. He can be tactless sometimes.
"
,,
3,22,"Like when he soiled himself
"
,,
3,22,"at that dinner party.
"
,,
3,22,"I was so sorry to hear
"
,,
3,22,"that your father passed away.
"
,,
3,22,"Yes. It spread through his body so fast,
"
,,
3,22,"but he's at peace now, and the whole thing...
"
,,
3,22,"Uh-oh!
"
,,
3,22,"Well, there's only one thing that'll top
"
,,
3,22,"a great dinner like that... Operation!
"
,,
3,22," May I play?
"
,,
3,22," Mom!
"
,,
3,22,"Thank you, but I can't stay.
"
,,
3,22,"It's Friday. I've gotta go to Temple.
"
,,
3,22,"Temple? Like Indiana Jones?
"
,,
3,22,"Will you just pick it up already?!
"
,,
3,22,"They better not be expecting money. I gave at
"
,,
3,22,"church and I'm sure it goes to the same god.
"
,,
3,22,"Peter! Max, it was nice of you
"
,,
3,22,"to invite us along.
"
,,
3,22,"Your husband's got a good heart
"
,,
3,22,"but his views on Judaism are misguided.
"
,,
3,22,"I'd consider it a mitzvah to educate him.
"
,,
3,22,"No, no! No, no, I don't think so.
"
,,
3,22,"It's not that I have ideological differences,
"
,,
3,22,"I'm just not a hat person.
"
,,
3,22,"Hey, I didn't know the principal
"
,,
3,22,"of Meg's school was Jewish.
"
,,
3,22,"Hey, there's Bill Nye the Science Guy.
"
,,
3,22,"And half of Lenny Kravitz.
"
,,
3,22,"Optimus Prime? He's Jewish?!
"
,,
3,22,"Jeez, Max, I don't know about this. I went to
"
,,
3,22,"Catholic school. I'm not sure this is allowed.
"
,,
3,22,"Ah, what the hell.
"
,,
3,22,"Oh dear. Sister Mary Joseph, it appears
"
,,
3,22,"Peter Griffin has entered a synagogue.
"
,,
3,22,"Lock and load, Brides of Christ!
"
,,
3,22,"Excellent, excellent.
"
,,
3,22," Hello.
"
,,
3,22," Oh, we're not Jewish.
"
,,
3,22,"But I hear you people
"
,,
3,22,"have such lovely services.
"
,,
3,22,"Oh, my God, I didn't mean ""you people"", I...
"
,,
3,22,"I-I didn't mean ""Oh, my God"" either.
"
,,
3,22,"I know he's your God too.
"
,,
3,22,"Shh.
"
,,
3,22,"And on this day, the Sabbath,
"
,,
3,22,"we gather here to...
"
,,
3,22,"Uh-oh!
"
,,
3,22,"Well, that was so nice.
"
,,
3,22,"A good sermon and such beautiful songs.
"
,,
3,22,"Yeah, just like that other
"
,,
3,22,"Jewish musical we saw.
"
,,
3,22,"A fiddler on the roof. Sounds crazy, no?
"
,,
3,22,"But here in our little village of Anatevka,
"
,,
3,22,"you might say each one of us...
"
,,
3,22,"Khan!
"
,,
3,22,"Kha-a-a-an!
"
,,
3,22," There's my cab. It was nice meeting you.
"
,,
3,22," Thanks for everything, buddy.
"
,,
3,22,"Mr Weinstein, I thought you were gonna
"
,,
3,22,"help me with my homework.
"
,,
3,22,"Sorry, son, I have to go.
"
,,
3,22,"But I'm sure you'll do just fine.
"
,,
3,22,"I dunno, Max. The kid's not exactly
"
,,
3,22,"an honour-roll student. Watch.
"
,,
3,22," Hey.
"
,,
3,22," He did it.
"
,,
3,22,"See?
"
,,
3,22,"Peter, you took me in, fed me dinner, came
"
,,
3,22,"to Temple with me. You're a nice family.
"
,,
3,22,"I have faith that Chris will
"
,,
3,22,"grow up to be a real mensch.
"
,,
3,22,"Lois, I just figured out how to make sure
"
,,
3,22,"Chris becomes a big success.
"
,,
3,22,"Tell me this has nothing
"
,,
3,22,"to do with Tony Robbins.
"
,,
3,22,"No, I learned my lesson.
"
,,
3,22," Could you sign this book, please?
"
,,
3,22," Tony Robbins hungry!
"
,,
3,22,"No, Lois. I'm gonna make Chris Jewish.
"
,,
3,22," What are you talkin' about?
"
,,
3,22," He thinks Chris will become smart.
"
,,
3,22,"You can't convert someone
"
,,
3,22,"because you think it'll help their grades.
"
,,
3,22,"I don't wanna hear another word about this.
"
,,
3,22," Where are we going?
"
,,
3,22," Son, it's too late for me, and Meg's a girl.
"
,,
3,22,"But for you the sky's the limit. We're gonna
"
,,
3,22,"go to that synagogue and turn you Jewish!
"
,,
3,22,"OK!
"
,,
3,22,"Chris, duck.
"
,,
3,22,"Mr Griffin, I still don't understand.
"
,,
3,22,"Why exactly does your son
"
,,
3,22,"want to join the Jewish faith?
"
,,
3,22,"I dunno, he's bicurious.
"
,,
3,22,"I appreciate your interest,
"
,,
3,22,"but Judaism takes a serious commitment.
"
,,
3,22,"Elliot here has spent years preparing
"
,,
3,22,"for his Bar Mitzvah this Saturday.
"
,,
3,22,"A Bar Mitzvah! Perfect!
"
,,
3,22,"How much for one of those?
"
,,
3,22,"You can't just buy a Bar Mitzvah.
"
,,
3,22,"It requires a lot of study.
"
,,
3,22,"Can't we skip it? I mean, if Chris could study
"
,,
3,22,"he wouldn't need to become Jewish, right?
"
,,
3,22,"Right?
"
,,
3,22,"Right?
"
,,
3,22,"Don't worry, Dad. I don't need a Bar Mitzvah.
"
,,
3,22,"I'm OK just the way I...
"
,,
3,22,"Ow! Ow! Ow!
"
,,
3,22,"Now, we got no time to lose.
"
,,
3,22,"There's gotta be some place in America
"
,,
3,22,"where you can take a spiritual ceremony
"
,,
3,22,"that begins a lifetime commitment
"
,,
3,22,"and blow through it in about 20 minutes.
"
,,
3,22,"All right, Dad!
"
,,
3,22,"So, how do I look in my new glasses?
"
,,
3,22,"How shall I put this? In an attic somewhere
"
,,
3,22,"there's a portrait of you getting prettier.
"
,,
3,22,"Wow, someone needs a nap.
"
,,
3,22,"After lunch it's straight to bed, Stewie.
"
,,
3,22,"This isn't the first time
"
,,
3,22,"my wit has gone unappreciated.
"
,,
3,22,"And in the comedy competition,
"
,,
3,22,"Stewie Griffin receives three and a half stars.
"
,,
3,22,"Challenger Sinbad receives... four stars!
"
,,
3,22,"We have a new champion - Sinbad!
"
,,
3,22,"Stewie, any parting words?
"
,,
3,22,"Um, you know, I got beat, pure and simple.
"
,,
3,22,"You-you are a very funny man.
"
,,
3,22,"""Men be acting all like zombies at the mall. ""
"
,,
3,22,"God, ain't that the truth?
"
,,
3,22,"Where's your father and Chris?
"
,,
3,22,"It's not like them to be late for lunch.
"
,,
3,22,"I think they left a note.
"
,,
3,22," What do you know about this?
"
,,
3,22," Nothing.
"
,,
3,22," I know when you're lying to me, Brian.
"
,,
3,22," No, no, I swear.
"
,,
3,22,"Meg, take Stewie upstairs.
"
,,
3,22," What-what-what are you doing?
"
,,
3,22," Oh, you don't know that either?
"
,,
3,22,"Last chance, Brian.
"
,,
3,22,"Agh! They're in Vegas
"
,,
3,22,"gettin' a quickie Bar Mitzvah.
"
,,
3,22,"What?!
"
,,
3,22,"Well, hel-Lois! Forgive me for pointing.
"
,,
3,22,"Quick, I need to borrow your car.
"
,,
3,22,"I've got a Bar Mitzvah to stop.
"
,,
3,22,"No problem. Let me grab my keys.
"
,,
3,22,"Ah. Here they are.
"
,,
3,22,"Aw, Chris. In a few minutes you'll become
"
,,
3,22,"a smart, successful Jewish man.
"
,,
3,22,"I could make a foreskin joke
"
,,
3,22,"but this is a solemn occasion.
"
,,
3,22,"Besides, there'll be plenty of time
"
,,
3,22,"for that on the ride back.
"
,,
3,22,"Oh, I got so many of 'em, too.
"
,,
3,22,"I know, I know. ""Shh. "" But later...
"
,,
3,22,"Chris!
"
,,
3,22,"Chris!
"
,,
3,22," Stop this travesty right now.
"
,,
3,22," So Bar Mitzvahs are travesties, huh?
"
,,
3,22,"No. My son getting
"
,,
3,22,"Bar Mitzvahed is a travesty.
"
,,
3,22,"He's doin' it for all the wrong reasons.
"
,,
3,22,"Well, lookee here, Herschel.
"
,,
3,22,"We got us one o' them self-hatin' Jews.
"
,,
3,22,"Nothin' I hate worse than a Jew who
"
,,
3,22,"doesn't appreciate her own rich heritage.
"
,,
3,22,"Come on, Mordecai, let's get her.
"
,,
3,22,"I'm sorry, Lois. I just wanted our son
"
,,
3,22,"to be Jewish so he'd be smarter.
"
,,
3,22,"Then his wife wouldn't be sorry
"
,,
3,22,"she didn't marry the chimp next door.
"
,,
3,22,"Peter, just because Steven makes more
"
,,
3,22,"money than you doesn't mean he's smarter.
"
,,
3,22," And I think Chris will do just fine.
"
,,
3,22," How do you know?
"
,,
3,22,"Because I have faith in him,
"
,,
3,22,"the way I have faith in you.
"
,,
3,22,"Besides, a person's religion
"
,,
3,22,"is no guarantee of success.
"
,,
3,22,"I see what you're saying. The Jewish
"
,,
3,22,"are just like us. No better, no worse.
"
,,
3,22,"Yeah, and as they say, ""zo Zion met grec"".
"
,,
3,22," What?
"
,,
3,22," I think what he's trying to say is
"
,,
3,22,"everything's gonna be OK.

3,22,"some Handsome Cream,

"

"

3,22,"who's a real whiz with volcanos,
"

3,22,"a volcano is coming this way.
"

3,22,"Hm. I too have an uncle.
"
,,
3,22,"Come in.
"
,,
3,22," How much is this volcano insurance?
"
,,
3,22," I-I don't know. Let's say $200.
"
,,
3,22,"$200?! That's more than I spent on
"
,,
3,22,"all that Handsome Cream. I don't have it.
"
,,
3,22," What about that jar of money?
"
,,
3,22," No way. That's Lois's rainy-day fund.
"

3,22," Come on. It never rains in Rhode Island.
"

3,22," Yeah, but we've never had a volcano either.
"

"

"
,,
3,22,"Who, me? Yes, me.
"
,,
3,22,"Couldn't be. Then who?
"
,,
3,22,"Yeah, I did it. I bought volcano insurance.
"
,,
3,22,"Volcano insurance? That's ridiculous.
"
,,
3,22,"That's what you said when you
"

"

3,22,"Yes. Tomorrow.
"
,,
3,22," I mean it this time.
"
,,
3,22," I do too.
"
,,
3,22,"Peter, that was our emergency money. And
"
,,
3,22,"your daughter needs a new pair of glasses.
"
,,
3,22," Lois, no one really needs glasses.
"
,,
3,22," You wear glasses.
"
,,
3,22,"That's only to fool the man
"
,,
3,22,"from the draft board.
"

3,22,"I can't believe you squandered that money.
"
,,
3,22,"I swear, sometimes I feel
"

3,22,"like I'm married to a child.
"
,,
3,22,"What can I say about my beautiful bride?
"
,,
3,22,"Except ""Milk, milk, lemonade,
"
,,
3,22,"around the corner fudge is made. ""
"
,,
3,22,"Watch who you're calling a child, because if
"
,,
3,22,"I'm a child, you know what that makes you?
"
,,
3,22,"A paedophile. And I'll be damned if I'm gonna
"

3,22,"Can you believe it?

3,22,"He made some smart investments
"
,,
3,22,"that really paid off.
"
,,
3,22,"That guy is to money
"
,,
3,22,"what Miss Ann-Margret is to...
"
,,
3,22,"Let me buy the drinks, Quagmire.
"
,,
3,22,"My accountant Larry Rosenblat
"
,,
3,22,"just got me a huge tax refund.
"
,,
3,22,"And tickets to Bring In 'Da Noise,
"
,,
3,22,"Bring In 'Da Funk.
"
,,
3,22,"The noise was good, but I thought
"
,,
3,22,"they phoned in a lot of the funk.
"
,,
3,22,"Wait. Rosenblat? Greenstein? You're saying
"
,,
3,22,"I need a Jewish guy to handle my money.
"
,,
3,22,"Peter, not every Jewish person
"
,,
3,22,"is good with money.
"
,,
3,22,"Well, yeah, not the retarded ones,
"
,,
3,22,"but why would you even say that?
"
,,
3,22,"For shock value? Jeez, Cleveland, there's
"
,,
3,22,"edgy and there's offensive. Good day, sir!
"
,,
3,22,"Mother, you know how
"
,,
3,22,"I hate asking for money, but...
"
,,
3,22,"Mother, Peter's an excellent provider.
"
,,
3,22,"No, Mother, I do not think I'd be
"
,,
3,22,"better off married to a chimp.
"
,,
3,22,"I don't care how well that chimp
"
,,
3,22,"across the street is doing.
"
,,
3,22,"Really? Well, yeah, OK,
"
,,
3,22,"I guess you can tell him I said hi.
"
,,
3,22,"But don't make me sound desperate.
"
,,
3,22,"I gotta get a Greenstein or
"
,,
3,22,"a Rosenblat of my very own.
"
,,
3,22,"Nothing else has worked so far
"
,,
3,22,"So I'll wish upon a star
"
,,
3,22,"Wondrous dancing speck of light
"
,,
3,22,"I need a Jew
"
,,
3,22,"Lois makes me take the rap
"
,,
3,22,"Cos our chequebook looks like crap
"
,,
3,22,"Since I can't give her a slap
"
,,
3,22,"I need a Jew
"
,,
3,22,"Where to find
"
,,
3,22,"A baum or stein or stin
"
,,
3,22,"To teach me how to whine
"
,,
3,22,"And do my taxes?
"
,,
3,22,"Though by many they're abhorred
"
,,
3,22,"Hebrew people I've adored
"
,,
3,22,"Even though they killed my Lord
"
,,
3,22,"I need...
"
,,
3,22,"A...
"
,,
3,22,"Jew
"
,,
3,22,"Hi. My name's Max Weinstein. My car
"
,,
3,22,"just broke down. May I use your phone?
"
,,
3,22,"Now my troubles are all through
"
,,
3,22,"I have...
"
,,
3,22,"A...
"
,,
3,22,"Jew
"
,,
3,22,"Hey!
"
,,
3,22,"I prayed for you, Max Weinstein.
"
,,
3,22,"And here you are!
"
,,
3,22,"OK... Listen, uh, thanks for
"
,,
3,22,"letting me use the phone.
"
,,
3,22,"Thanks for Spaceballs.
"
,,
3,22," Well, if there's anything I can do for you...
"
,,
3,22," You can't leave!
"
,,
3,22,"Aaargh!
"
,,
3,22," What do you want?!
"
,,
3,22," Financial advice.
"
,,
3,22,"How the hell did you know
"
,,
3,22,"I'm an accountant?
"
,,
3,22,"Hello?! Max Weinstein?
"
,,
3,22,"I'll try, but I don't know why you
"
,,
3,22,"think I can get your money back.
"
,,
3,22,"Max, Max, Max, let's not deny our heritages.
"
,,
3,22,"You're Jewish; you're good with money.
"
,,
3,22,"I'm Irish; I drink and I ban homosexuals from
"
,,
3,22,"marching in my parade. Now get my money.
"
,,
3,22,"Oh. It's you. Um...
"
,,
3,22,"I'm not in right now.
"
,,
3,22,"Please leave a message. Beep!
"
,,
3,22,"Man, I hate these things. Uh, yeah, hi,
"
,,
3,22,"this is Peter Griffin. Sorry I missed you...
"
,,
3,22,"Peter, play with this. Sir, I reviewed
"
,,
3,22,"this contract and it offers no cover at all.
"
,,
3,22,"It just says ""volcano insurance""
"
,,
3,22,"over and over again.
"
,,
3,22,"And down here in small print it says ""He's
"
,,
3,22,"signing it, he's signing it, I can't believe it. ""
"
,,
3,22,"So?
"
,,
3,22,"Refund this man's money and we'll go.
"
,,
3,22," I don't have your money!
"
,,
3,22," How about that money?
"
,,
3,22,"No way! That's Lois's rainy-day fund!
"
,,
3,22,"Ah, dammit.
"
,,
3,22," You didn't date her cos she was a tickler?
"
,,
3,22," Tickler!
"
,,
3,22," You're not a stickler for a tickler?
"
,,
3,22," Not a stickler.
"
,,
3,22,"Not a tickler stickler?
"
,,
3,22," Tickler stickler ickler...
"
,,
3,22," Ickler tickler...
"
,,
3,22," Where the hell is the remote?
"
,,
3,22," Hey, honey, guess what?
"
,,
3,22," I got back the money for Meg's glasses.
"
,,
3,22," Really?
"
,,
3,22,"Oh, honey! Oh, hello.
"
,,
3,22,"This is my special friend
"
,,
3,22,"Max Weinstein. He's Jewish.
"
,,
3,22," Ooh, my. How exotic.
"
,,
3,22," Thank you...?
"
,,
3,22,"See, here's your rainy-day money,
"
,,
3,22,"and I balanced our chequebook too.
"
,,
3,22," You balanced our chequebook?
"
,,
3,22," Yep. Isn't that right, Max?
"
,,
3,22,"Mm? Oh, yeah, sure. He did it.
"
,,
3,22,"I'm gonna call my mother right now and
"
,,
3,22,"tell her to tell that chimp across the street...
"
,,
3,22,"Look how low I've sunk. Taking credit
"
,,
3,22,"for something a smart Jewish person did.
"
,,
3,22," That's OK, Peter.
"
,,
3,22," People have done that for too damn long!
"
,,
3,22,"It is the white devil that has propagated,
"
,,
3,22,"exacerbated, instigated...
"
,,
3,22,"Instigated... Line?
"
,,
3,22,"Instigated our hatred like a Buick.
"
,,
3,22,"God, what was I thinking
"
,,
3,22,"when I agreed to this?
"
,,
3,22,"This is so degrading. This is worse
"
,,
3,22,"than the time I was at the Friars Club
"
,,
3,22,"and Soon-Yi's retainer fell out of my pants.
"
,,
3,22,"Lois, I appreciate
"
,,
3,22,"the marshmallow and fish casserole,
"
,,
3,22,"but I'm sorry, I can't eat this.
"
,,
3,22,"Oh, because it's not kosher?
"
,,
3,22," Yeah, let's go with that.
"
,,
3,22," Can Stewie and me be excused?
"
,,
3,22," He's gonna help with my math homework.
"
,,
3,22," Chris, he's just a baby.
"
,,
3,22,"Oh, and you're a regular Rhodes scholar
"
,,
3,22,"Where was it you graduated from again?
"
,,
3,22,"Hm? The University of Duhhhh?
"
,,
3,22," I can help you with your homework, son.
"
,,
3,22," God! Is there nothing you people can't do?
"
,,
3,22," I mean, other than manual labour.
"
,,
3,22," Peter! What a ridiculous thing to say.
"
,,
3,22,"They built the pyramids. You'll have to
"
,,
3,22,"excuse Peter. He can be tactless sometimes.
"
,,
3,22,"Like when he soiled himself
"
,,
3,22,"at that dinner party.
"
,,
3,22,"I was so sorry to hear
"
,,
3,22,"that your father passed away.
"
,,
3,22,"Yes. It spread through his body so fast,
"
,,
3,22,"but he's at peace now, and the whole thing...
"
,,
3,22,"Uh-oh!
"
,,
3,22,"Well, there's only one thing that'll top
"
,,
3,22,"a great dinner like that... Operation!
"
,,
3,22," May I play?
"
,,
3,22," Mom!
"
,,
3,22,"Thank you, but I can't stay.
"
,,
3,22,"It's Friday. I've gotta go to Temple.
"
,,
3,22,"Temple? Like Indiana Jones?
"
,,
3,22,"Will you just pick it up already?!
"
,,
3,22,"They better not be expecting money. I gave at
"
,,
3,22,"church and I'm sure it goes to the same god.
"
,,
3,22,"Peter! Max, it was nice of you
"
,,
3,22,"to invite us along.
"
,,
3,22,"Your husband's got a good heart
"
,,
3,22,"but his views on Judaism are misguided.
"
,,
3,22,"I'd consider it a mitzvah to educate him.
"
,,
3,22,"No, no! No, no, I don't think so.
"
,,
3,22,"It's not that I have ideological differences,
"
,,
3,22,"I'm just not a hat person.
"
,,
3,22,"Hey, I didn't know the principal
"
,,
3,22,"of Meg's school was Jewish.
"
,,
3,22,"Hey, there's Bill Nye the Science Guy.
"
,,
3,22,"And half of Lenny Kravitz.
"
,,
3,22,"Optimus Prime? He's Jewish?!
"
,,
3,22,"Jeez, Max, I don't know about this. I went to
"
,,
3,22,"Catholic school. I'm not sure this is allowed.
"
,,
3,22,"Ah, what the hell.
"
,,
3,22,"Oh dear. Sister Mary Joseph, it appears
"
,,
3,22,"Peter Griffin has entered a synagogue.
"
,,
3,22,"Lock and load, Brides of Christ!
"
,,
3,22,"Excellent, excellent.
"
,,
3,22," Hello.
"
,,
3,22," Oh, we're not Jewish.
"
,,
3,22,"But I hear you people
"
,,
3,22,"have such lovely services.
"
,,
3,22,"Oh, my God, I didn't mean ""you people"", I...
"
,,
3,22,"I-I didn't mean ""Oh, my God"" either.
"
,,
3,22,"I know he's your God too.
"
,,
3,22,"Shh.
"
,,
3,22,"And on this day, the Sabbath,
"
,,
3,22,"we gather here to...
"
,,
3,22,"Uh-oh!
"
,,
3,22,"Well, that was so nice.
"
,,
3,22,"A good sermon and such beautiful songs.
"
,,
3,22,"Yeah, just like that other
"
,,
3,22,"Jewish musical we saw.
"
,,
3,22,"A fiddler on the roof. Sounds crazy, no?
"
,,
3,22,"But here in our little village of Anatevka,
"
,,
3,22,"you might say each one of us...
"
,,
3,22,"Khan!
"
,,
3,22,"Kha-a-a-an!
"
,,
3,22," There's my cab. It was nice meeting you.
"
,,
3,22," Thanks for everything, buddy.
"
,,
3,22,"Mr Weinstein, I thought you were gonna
"
,,
3,22,"help me with my homework.
"
,,
3,22,"Sorry, son, I have to go.
"
,,
3,22,"But I'm sure you'll do just fine.
"
,,
3,22,"I dunno, Max. The kid's not exactly
"
,,
3,22,"an honour-roll student. Watch.
"
,,
3,22," Hey.
"
,,
3,22," He did it.
"
,,
3,22,"See?
"
,,
3,22,"Peter, you took me in, fed me dinner, came
"
,,
3,22,"to Temple with me. You're a nice family.
"
,,
3,22,"I have faith that Chris will
"
,,
3,22,"grow up to be a real mensch.
"
,,
3,22,"Lois, I just figured out how to make sure
"
,,
3,22,"Chris becomes a big success.
"
,,
3,22,"Tell me this has nothing
"
,,
3,22,"to do with Tony Robbins.
"
,,
3,22,"No, I learned my lesson.
"
,,
3,22," Could you sign this book, please?
"
,,
3,22," Tony Robbins hungry!
"
,,
3,22,"No, Lois. I'm gonna make Chris Jewish.
"
,,
3,22," What are you talkin' about?
"
,,
3,22," He thinks Chris will become smart.
"
,,
3,22,"You can't convert someone
"
,,
3,22,"because you think it'll help their grades.
"
,,
3,22,"I don't wanna hear another word about this.
"
,,
3,22," Where are we going?
"
,,
3,22," Son, it's too late for me, and Meg's a girl.
"
,,
3,22,"But for you the sky's the limit. We're gonna
"
,,
3,22,"go to that synagogue and turn you Jewish!
"
,,
3,22,"OK!
"
,,
3,22,"Chris, duck.
"
,,
3,22,"Mr Griffin, I still don't understand.
"
,,
3,22,"Why exactly does your son
"
,,
3,22,"want to join the Jewish faith?
"
,,
3,22,"I dunno, he's bicurious.
"
,,
3,22,"I appreciate your interest,
"
,,
3,22,"but Judaism takes a serious commitment.
"
,,
3,22,"Elliot here has spent years preparing
"
,,
3,22,"for his Bar Mitzvah this Saturday.
"
,,
3,22,"A Bar Mitzvah! Perfect!
"
,,
3,22,"How much for one of those?
"
,,
3,22,"You can't just buy a Bar Mitzvah.
"
,,
3,22,"It requires a lot of study.
"
,,
3,22,"Can't we skip it? I mean, if Chris could study
"
,,
3,22,"he wouldn't need to become Jewish, right?
"
,,
3,22,"Right?
"
,,
3,22,"Right?
"
,,
3,22,"Don't worry, Dad. I don't need a Bar Mitzvah.
"
,,
3,22,"I'm OK just the way I...
"
,,
3,22,"Ow! Ow! Ow!
"
,,
3,22,"Now, we got no time to lose.
"
,,
3,22,"There's gotta be some place in America
"
,,
3,22,"where you can take a spiritual ceremony
"
,,
3,22,"that begins a lifetime commitment
"
,,
3,22,"and blow through it in about 20 minutes.
"
,,
3,22,"All right, Dad!
"
,,
3,22,"So, how do I look in my new glasses?
"
,,
3,22,"How shall I put this? In an attic somewhere
"
,,
3,22,"there's a portrait of you getting prettier.
"
,,
3,22,"Wow, someone needs a nap.
"
,,
3,22,"After lunch it's straight to bed, Stewie.
"
,,
3,22,"This isn't the first time
"
,,
3,22,"my wit has gone unappreciated.
"
,,
3,22,"And in the comedy competition,
"
,,
3,22,"Stewie Griffin receives three and a half stars.
"
,,
3,22,"Challenger Sinbad receives... four stars!
"
,,
3,22,"We have a new champion - Sinbad!
"
,,
3,22,"Stewie, any parting words?
"
,,
3,22,"Um, you know, I got beat, pure and simple.
"
,,
3,22,"You-you are a very funny man.
"
,,
3,22,"""Men be acting all like zombies at the mall. ""
"
,,
3,22,"God, ain't that the truth?
"
,,
3,22,"Where's your father and Chris?
"
,,
3,22,"It's not like them to be late for lunch.
"
,,
3,22,"I think they left a note.
"
,,
3,22," What do you know about this?
"
,,
3,22," Nothing.
"
,,
3,22," I know when you're lying to me, Brian.
"
,,
3,22," No, no, I swear.
"
,,
3,22,"Meg, take Stewie upstairs.
"
,,
3,22," What-what-what are you doing?
"
,,
3,22," Oh, you don't know that either?
"
,,
3,22,"Last chance, Brian.
"
,,
3,22,"Agh! They're in Vegas
"
,,
3,22,"gettin' a quickie Bar Mitzvah.
"
,,
3,22,"What?!
"
,,
3,22,"Well, hel-Lois! Forgive me for pointing.
"
,,
3,22,"Quick, I need to borrow your car.
"
,,
3,22,"I've got a Bar Mitzvah to stop.
"
,,
3,22,"No problem. Let me grab my keys.
"
,,
3,22,"Ah. Here they are.
"
,,
3,22,"Aw, Chris. In a few minutes you'll become
"
,,
3,22,"a smart, successful Jewish man.
"
,,
3,22,"I could make a foreskin joke
"
,,
3,22,"but this is a solemn occasion.
"
,,
3,22,"Besides, there'll be plenty of time
"
,,
3,22,"for that on the ride back.
"
,,
3,22,"Oh, I got so many of 'em, too.
"
,,
3,22,"I know, I know. ""Shh. "" But later...
"
,,
3,22,"Chris!
"
,,
3,22,"Chris!
"
,,
3,22," Stop this travesty right now.
"
,,
3,22," So Bar Mitzvahs are travesties, huh?
"
,,
3,22,"No. My son getting
"
,,
3,22,"Bar Mitzvahed is a travesty.
"
,,
3,22,"He's doin' it for all the wrong reasons.
"
,,
3,22,"Well, lookee here, Herschel.
"
,,
3,22,"We got us one o' them self-hatin' Jews.
"
,,
3,22,"Nothin' I hate worse than a Jew who
"
,,
3,22,"doesn't appreciate her own rich heritage.
"
,,
3,22,"Come on, Mordecai, let's get her.
"
,,
3,22,"I'm sorry, Lois. I just wanted our son
"
,,
3,22,"to be Jewish so he'd be smarter.
"
,,
3,22,"Then his wife wouldn't be sorry
"
,,
3,22,"she didn't marry the chimp next door.
"
,,
3,22,"Peter, just because Steven makes more
"
,,
3,22,"money than you doesn't mean he's smarter.
"
,,
3,22," And I think Chris will do just fine.
"
,,
3,22," How do you know?
"
,,
3,22,"Because I have faith in him,
"
,,
3,22,"the way I have faith in you.
"
,,
3,22,"Besides, a person's religion
"
,,
3,22,"is no guarantee of success.
"
,,
3,22,"I see what you're saying. The Jewish
"
,,
3,22,"are just like us. No better, no worse.
"
,,
3,22,"Yeah, and as they say, ""zo Zion met grec"".
"
,,
3,22," What?
"
,,
3,22," I think what he's trying to say is
"
,,
3,22,"everything's gonna be OK.

4,1," Okay, I get it.
"
,,
4,1,"You foul, venereal-disease-carrying,
"
,,
4,1,"streetwalking whore.
"
,,
4,1,"All right, that's enough.
"
,,
4,1,"[Loud creaking]
"
,,
4,1,"It's good to have land.
"
,,
4,1,"[Peter and Lois giggling]
"
,,
4,1,"[Lois moaning]
"
,,
4,1,"LOIS: George!
"
,,
4,1," George? Who the hell is George?
"
,,
4,1," George Clooney.
"
,,
4,1,"Our sex is so dull for you that you
"
,,
4,1,"got to fantasize about George Clooney?
"
,,
4,1,"I'm sorry, honey.
"
,,
4,1,"I guess that things have become
"
,,
4,1,"a little stale for me.
"
,,
4,1,"I don't know what to do.
"
,,
4,1,"I mean, I don't really know that much
"
,,
4,1,"about any kinky stuff.
"
,,
4,1,"I mean, I could hook this car battery
"
,,
4,1,"up to my nipples.
"
,,
4,1,"Oh, God!
"
,,
4,1,"Ow! Ow! Ow!
"
,,
4,1,"This doing it for you?
"
,,
4,1,"I don't know.
"
,,
4,1,"I just don't feel that spark anymore.
"
,,
4,1,"I mean, our honeymoon.
"
,,
4,1,"So much rug burn!
"
,,
4,1,"Wait a second, Lois. That's what we need.
"
,,
4,1,"We'll go on a second honeymoon.
"
,,
4,1,"Peter, that's a wonderful idea!
"
,,
4,1,"Yeah. We'll be just like
"
,,
4,1,"[Audience laughing]
"
,,
4,1,"Well, that's everything.
"
,,
4,1,"Now, remember, kids...
"
,,
4,1,"Brian is in charge while your father and I
"
,,
4,1,"are out at Cape Cod.
"
,,
4,1,"I'll take good care of them, Lois.
"
,,
4,1,"You guys have a good time.
"
,,
4,1," Be good.
"
,,
4,1," Bye, Mom, I love you!
"
,,
4,1,"Brian, if I choose to make
"
,,
4,1,"stool in my pants right now...
"
,,
4,1,"you're the only one here to change me.
"
,,
4,1,"What do you think of that?
"
,,
4,1," I'm not gonna change you.
"
,,
4,1," What?
"
,,
4,1," I said, I'm not going to change you.
"
,,
4,1," You can't be serious.
"
,,
4,1,"What if I make a fudgie?
"
,,
4,1,"I just won't, that's all. I just won't.
"
,,
4,1,"Blast, I just did!
"
,,
4,1,"Chris, cut it out!
"
,,
4,1,"Brian, Chris just picked his nose
"
,,
4,1,"and he keeps touching me with his finger!
"
,,
4,1,"What good is mining nose gold
"
,,
4,1,"if I can't share it with the townspeople?
"
,,
4,1,"I swear to God, these kids are gonna
"
,,
4,1,"make me put a bullet through my head.
"
,,
4,1,"If I was in charge,
"
,,
4,1,"we wouldn't be having this problem.
"
,,
4,1,"You got some ideas? Tell me.
"
,,
4,1,"I'll tell you.
"
,,
4,1,"Of course, I'll want a favor in exchange.
"
,,
4,1,"[Stewie laughs maniacally]
"
,,
4,1,"How does it smell, dog?
"
,,
4,1,"Does it smell like servitude?
"
,,
4,1,"Aft torpedoes, fire!
"
,,
4,1,"Lois?
"
,,
4,1,"Hey, Lois, honey?
"
,,
4,1,"Sweetheart?
"
,,
4,1,"You're awake!
"
,,
4,1," Hey, can you hand me the pretzels?
"
,,
4,1," Here. Where are we?
"
,,
4,1,"About two hours from Cape Cod's
"
,,
4,1,"most luxurious bed and breakfast.
"
,,
4,1,"Peter, this is gonna be wonderful.
"
,,
4,1,"I'm so excited
"
,,
4,1,"I want to prep my diaphragm now.
"
,,
4,1,"Gross. Hey, why don't you
"
,,
4,1,"go back to sleep?
"
,,
4,1," I'll wake you up when we get there.
"
,,
4,1," Okay.
"
,,
4,1,"PETER: Look at all those hamburgers.
"
,,
4,1,"You can't eat all those hamburgers,
"
,,
4,1,"you stupid fellow!
"
,,
4,1,"He's gonna do it! He's so ridiculous.
"
,,
4,1,"You hear me, you ridiculous man? You're...
"
,,
4,1,"Peter, what the hell is wrong with you?
"
,,
4,1,"I fall asleep for 10 minutes...
"
,,
4,1,"and you plow the car into a tree?
"
,,
4,1,"Oh, my God! You got to pay attention
"
,,
4,1,"to the road. We could have been killed!
"
,,
4,1,"I mean, look at the front of our car.
"
,,
4,1,"It's totaled. It's completely totaled, Peter!
"
,,
4,1,"This is just terrific.
"
,,
4,1,"How are we gonna get...
"
,,
4,1,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
4,1,"I knew I should have driven.
"
,,
4,1,"I should always drive.
"
,,
4,1,"I cannot trust you, Peter Griffin!
"
,,
4,1,"Dear God, this is where we're sleeping?
"
,,
4,1,"Come on, Lois. They said
"
,,
4,1,"they'd have the car fixed by tomorrow.
"
,,
4,1,"And then our second honeymoon's back
"
,,
4,1,"on track.
"
,,
4,1,"Peter, there's a hooker on the bed.
"
,,
4,1," Hi.
"
,,
4,1," Stand perfectly still, Lois.
"
,,
4,1,"Their vision is based on movement.
"
,,
4,1,"Where did you go?
"
,,
4,1,"Turn it, Chris.
"
,,
4,1,"I want to watch <i>George Lopez.</i>
"
,,
4,1,"That show only furthers the stereotype
"
,,
4,1,"that George Lopez is funny.
"
,,
4,1," Give me that!
"
,,
4,1," Chris, Give me the remote.
"
,,
4,1," Chris, stop!
"
,,
4,1," Stop doing that!
"
,,
4,1,"My hat!
"
,,
4,1,"Wear it now.
"
,,
4,1,"You two better settle down.
"
,,
4,1," Chris, give Meg her hat.
"
,,
4,1," I don't have to listen to you.
"
,,
4,1,"You're a dog! You don't have a soul!
"
,,
4,1,"Ow.
"
,,
4,1,"Don't take that. Raise your voice to them.
"
,,
4,1,"Hey! Knock it off!
"
,,
4,1,"Look, you kids are obviously in need
"
,,
4,1,"of some type of activity.
"
,,
4,1,"I don't know. What do you say
"
,,
4,1,"we read a book or something?
"
,,
4,1,"Stewie, what does Peter have
"
,,
4,1,"on his bookshelf?
"
,,
4,1,"Two Garfield books and the novelization
"
,,
4,1,"of the movie <i>Caddyshack.</i>
"
,,
4,1,"""Mananananana,"" said Ty,
"
,,
4,1,"sinking yet another ball.
"
,,
4,1,"""Mananananana..."" Hang on.
"
,,
4,1,"[Phone rings]
"
,,
4,1,"Thank God.
"
,,
4,1,"Now, as you can see in this panel,
"
,,
4,1,"Garfield doesn't care for Nermal.
"
,,
4,1,"But like him or not, Nermal is here to stay.
"
,,
4,1,"Or is he? Let's read on.
"
,,
4,1,"Okay, I'll be there.
"
,,
4,1,"Peter and Lois were supposed to
"
,,
4,1,"chaperone Chris' school dance...
"
,,
4,1,"tomorrow night. So, I guess it's up to me.
"
,,
4,1,"You mean it's up to us. Clearly you
"
,,
4,1,"need my help with this parenting thing.
"
,,
4,1,"You're too stupid to do it alone.
"
,,
4,1,"Besides, I know how to deal with
"
,,
4,1,"children, unlike Mr. Geppetto.
"
,,
4,1,"Oh, no. I dropped my glasses.
"
,,
4,1,"By the way, Pinocchio,
"
,,
4,1,"there was a cookie missing from the jar.
"
,,
4,1,"Did you take it by any chance?
"
,,
4,1,"Yes, Papa Geppetto. I'm sorry.
"
,,
4,1,"Are you sure you took it? Because
"
,,
4,1,"I'd believe you if you said you didn't.
"
,,
4,1,"No, I took it, Papa. I wouldn't lie to you.
"
,,
4,1,"You could try. Who knows?
"
,,
4,1,"You might get away with it.
"
,,
4,1,"$900 to fix the car.
"
,,
4,1,"That was all the money we had
"
,,
4,1,"for this trip.
"
,,
4,1,"Look, Peter, this second honeymoon
"
,,
4,1,"was a nice thought...
"
,,
4,1,"but maybe we should just go home.
"
,,
4,1,"Fancy place. Boy, that'd make
"
,,
4,1,"some second honeymoon.
"
,,
4,1,"Barely uses? Lois, I just got an idea!
"
,,
4,1,"Much better than that time
"
,,
4,1,"I experimented with gene splicing.
"
,,
4,1,"Lois, quick question.
"
,,
4,1,"Do we have any Tylenol?
"
,,
4,1,"[Funky dance music playing]
"
,,
4,1,"How I envy them, dog. They've got
"
,,
4,1,"their whole lives ahead of them.
"
,,
4,1,"Man, look at that kid.
"
,,
4,1,"That is one ugly eighth grader.
"
,,
4,1,"You don't want to hurt yourself dancing.
"
,,
4,1,"Make sure you stretch out
"
,,
4,1,"those creamy hamstrings.
"
,,
4,1,"Come on, Chris. It's just vodka.
"
,,
4,1,"Jake swiped it
"
,,
4,1,"from his dad's liquor cabinet.
"
,,
4,1,"Yeah, see? It's good.
"
,,
4,1,"Well, okay. Maybe just one sip.
"
,,
4,1,"Christopher Griffin, is that alcohol?
"
,,
4,1,"Mister, you're in serious trouble.
"
,,
4,1,"He's absolutely right, kids.
"
,,
4,1,"Because when you drink, nobody wins.
"
,,
4,1,"In fact, last year alone,
"
,,
4,1,"there were over 27,000 deaths from...
"
,,
4,1,"chronic liver disease
"
,,
4,1,"as a result of alcohol abuse.
"
,,
4,1," Now we know.
"
,,
4,1," And knowing is half the battle.
"
,,
4,1,"CHORUS: G.I. Joe!
"
,,
4,1," Peter, we can't afford this.
"
,,
4,1," No, but Mel Gibson can.
"
,,
4,1,"Excuse me, I'm Mel Gibson, here for
"
,,
4,1,"the key to my specially reserved room.
"
,,
4,1,"You're Mel Gibson?
"
,,
4,1,"Yes, I've put on a few pounds
"
,,
4,1,"for my next role.
"
,,
4,1,"I play Peter Griffin, a heroic warrior
"
,,
4,1,"who defied the English to free England...
"
,,
4,1," from the English.
"
,,
4,1," Holy mackerel!
"
,,
4,1,"Let me show you
"
,,
4,1,"to your room, Mr. Gibson!
"
,,
4,1,"Peter, the toilet paper is made of money.
"
,,
4,1,"Yeah, and look at this. They even got
"
,,
4,1,"some of that high-class British porn.
"
,,
4,1,"Did you think you were cool?
"
,,
4,1,"Did you think you were grown up?
"
,,
4,1,"I didn't actually drink any of it.
"
,,
4,1,"Besides, Jake Tucker gave it to me.
"
,,
4,1,"We are going to have a talk with Jake's
"
,,
4,1,"parents tomorrow after my burping.
"
,,
4,1,"And, in the meantime,
"
,,
4,1,"you're grounded, Chris.
"
,,
4,1,"Come on. That sucks!
"
,,
4,1," Do you want us to pull over?
"
,,
4,1," I don't care what you do!
"
,,
4,1,"We'll pull over. We'll pull over. Pull over.
"
,,
4,1,"[Sobbing]
"
,,
4,1,"If your teachers ask about your bruises,
"
,,
4,1,"what do you tell them?
"
,,
4,1,"I got hit by a baseball!
"
,,
4,1,"[Peter and Lois giggling]
"
,,
4,1," Mel!
"
,,
4,1," Mel? Wait a minute.
"
,,
4,1,"You were fantasizing about Mel Gibson.
"
,,
4,1,"You don't find me attractive anymore.
"
,,
4,1,"Honey, I'm sorry. I know you're trying.
"
,,
4,1,"But you can't force the spark
"
,,
4,1,"back into our marriage.
"
,,
4,1,"Well, then I guess this whole second
"
,,
4,1,"honeymoon was a waste of time.
"
,,
4,1," Peter...
"
,,
4,1," I don't want to talk about it!
"
,,
4,1,"I'm just gonna watch British porn.
"
,,
4,1,"Do you think we were too hard
"
,,
4,1,"on Chris tonight?
"
,,
4,1,"What? Oh, God, no.
"
,,
4,1,"No, no. I don't...
"
,,
4,1,"I don't think so.
"
,,
4,1,"Do you?
"
,,
4,1,"No, I just always feel badly
"
,,
4,1,"when we have to be strict.
"
,,
4,1,"Did I remember to turn the stove off?
"
,,
4,1,"Yes.
"
,,
4,1,"I'm sorry for everything
"
,,
4,1,"that's happened, Peter.
"
,,
4,1,"I guess I'm going through a phase
"
,,
4,1,"right now...
"
,,
4,1,"where I'm only attracted
"
,,
4,1,"to handsome men.
"
,,
4,1,"Well, what are we supposed to do, Lois?
"
,,
4,1,"Just admit that there's no excitement
"
,,
4,1,"left in our marriage?
"
,,
4,1,"Go home and spend the rest of our lives
"
,,
4,1,"looking at each other...
"
,,
4,1,"across the breakfast table, talking about
"
,,
4,1,"how much we both like Total?
"
,,
4,1," I love Total.
"
,,
4,1," Actually, so do I.
"
,,
4,1,"And it's healthy for us, too.
"
,,
4,1,"Oh, God! It's starting already!
"
,,
4,1,"Lois, we are screwed.
"
,,
4,1,"Mel Gibson's secret screening room.
"
,,
4,1,"Hey, what's this?
"
,,
4,1,"NARRATOR: <i>Chris Tucker and Jim...</i>
"
,,
4,1,"[Narrator stammering]
"
,,
4,1,"Passion of the Christ 2:
"
,,
4,1,"Crucify This.
"
,,
4,1,"[Rock instrumental music playing
"
,,
4,1,"on screen]
"
,,
4,1,"Man, that's all we need.
"
,,
4,1,"More Mel Gibson Jesus mumbo jumbo.
"
,,
4,1,"Well, not if I have anything to say about it!
"
,,
4,1,"I am going to make sure
"
,,
4,1,"this never sees the light of day.
"
,,
4,1,"Peter, are you crazy?
"
,,
4,1,"Stealing Mel Gibson's towels,
"
,,
4,1,"bathrobes, and Nazi paraphernalia...
"
,,
4,1,"is one thing,
"
,,
4,1,"but this is a multi-million-dollar film.
"
,,
4,1,"And he's a very powerful man.
"
,,
4,1,"He could have us arrested or killed.
"
,,
4,1,"It's worth the risk, Lois.
"
,,
4,1,"To save the world
"
,,
4,1,"another two hours of torture.
"
,,
4,1,"We gotta get rid of this thing for the sake
"
,,
4,1,"of Jesus and Snoopy...
"
,,
4,1,"and all the other
"
,,
4,1,"beloved children's characters.
"
,,
4,1,"Let's go!
"
,,
4,1,"Pardon me. We work for Mel Gibson.
"
,,
4,1,"Seems he left something very valuable
"
,,
4,1,"in his room and we're here to retrieve it.
"
,,
4,1,"Mr. Gibson just checked out
"
,,
4,1,"a moment ago.
"
,,
4,1,"There he goes now.
"
,,
4,1,"Lois, run!
"
,,
4,1,"Hey, stop!
"
,,
4,1,"[Chiding]
"
,,
4,1,"They're gaining on us.
"
,,
4,1,"We never should have stolen this film.
"
,,
4,1,"Man, this is even more intense
"
,,
4,1,"than that time I forgot how to sit down.
"
,,
4,1,"Don't worry, Lois.
"
,,
4,1,"I think I know how to lose them.
"
,,
4,1," Peter, what the hell are you doing?
"
,,
4,1," Lois, trust me.
"
,,
4,1," How many times have I done this before?
"
,,
4,1," All right, but be careful.
"
,,
4,1,"Okay, now, be polite. And for God's sake...
"
,,
4,1,"don't mention anything
"
,,
4,1,"about his kid's face.
"
,,
4,1,"Shut up! I am always so polite.
"
,,
4,1,"I hope we don't wind up
"
,,
4,1,"on the evening news 'cause of this.
"
,,
4,1,"You're funny.
"
,,
4,1,"Brian, please come in.
"
,,
4,1,"Can my wife, Stacy, get you anything?
"
,,
4,1," Go to hell, Tom.
"
,,
4,1," Already there, hon.
"
,,
4,1,"Yes, well, Mr. Tucker, it seems
"
,,
4,1,"your son Jake had some vodka...
"
,,
4,1,"at the school dance
"
,,
4,1,"and Chris got blamed for it.
"
,,
4,1,"This whole situation has just turned
"
,,
4,1,"his whole life upside-down face.
"
,,
4,1,"It's no concern of mine if it's turned
"
,,
4,1,"his life upside-down face.
"
,,
4,1," Jake's a good boy. Aren't you, Jake?
"
,,
4,1," Yeah!
"
,,
4,1," Look, Mr. Tucker, l...
"
,,
4,1," We're through here.
"
,,
4,1,"Get out of my house, Benji!
"
,,
4,1,"Fine! If you're gonna be that way
"
,,
4,1,"about it, maybe I'll do this.
"
,,
4,1," Yeah, look at this.
"
,,
4,1," Stop that!
"
,,
4,1,"Yeah, you don't like this, huh?
"
,,
4,1," This is what Benji would do.
"
,,
4,1," Stop doing that in my carpet!
"
,,
4,1," Knock it off! Stop it!
"
,,
4,1," That feels so good.
"
,,
4,1,"There's got to be a way to get back
"
,,
4,1,"at Jake Tucker for what he did to Chris.
"
,,
4,1,"I know! Let's plant drugs in his locker.
"
,,
4,1," Oh, my God! That's a great idea.
"
,,
4,1," Yeah, thought you'd like that.
"
,,
4,1,"Hey, look at that Yosemite Sam mud flap.
"
,,
4,1,"You had better stay back, Brian.
"
,,
4,1,"I think we lost them.
"
,,
4,1,"You stay here. I'm gonna go bury this film.
"
,,
4,1,"Well, Mel Gibson,
"
,,
4,1,"this is one piece of crap...
"
,,
4,1,"the world will never have to
"
,,
4,1,"suffer through.
"
,,
4,1,"I am so clever.
"
,,
4,1,"That's why they picked me
"
,,
4,1,"to convince Congress to go to war.
"
,,
4,1,"There is no just cause
"
,,
4,1,"for an invasion of Iraq.
"
,,
4,1,"Well, that may be.
"
,,
4,1,"But what we're all forgetting is...
"
,,
4,1,"anyone who doesn't
"
,,
4,1,"want to go to war is gay.
"
,,
4,1," I want to go to war.
"
,,
4,1," Yes.
"
,,
4,1," We should definitely go.
"
,,
4,1," Yes, we should totally go to war.
"
,,
4,1,"I was the first one who wanted to
"
,,
4,1,"go to war.
"
,,
4,1,"Peter!
"
,,
4,1,"Lois!
"
,,
4,1,"Don't take this personally, Mrs. Griffin.
"
,,
4,1,"I'm doing this because I have to.
"
,,
4,1,"What are you gonna do to me?
"
,,
4,1,"What are you gonna do to me?
"
,,
4,1,"As soon as your husband gives me
"
,,
4,1,"what I want, you're free to go.
"
,,
4,1,"PETER: Anybody home?
"
,,
4,1," Peter!
"
,,
4,1," All right, Gibson. I want my wife back.
"
,,
4,1,"Or a woman
"
,,
4,1,"of equal physical attractiveness.
"
,,
4,1,"Where's the film?
"
,,
4,1," Come on, honey, let's get out of here.
"
,,
4,1," You're just gonna give him the film?
"
,,
4,1,"Don't worry, Lois.
"
,,
4,1,"There's a dog turd in there.
"
,,
4,1,"But by the time he finds out,
"
,,
4,1,"we'll be long...
"
,,
4,1,"There's a dog turd in here.
"
,,
4,1," Lois?
"
,,
4,1," What?
"
,,
4,1,"Jump!
"
,,
4,1,"No, wait!
"
,,
4,1,"I'll deal with them myself.
"
,,
4,1,"LOIS: We're on top of the monument.
"
,,
4,1,"Holy crap!
"
,,
4,1,"[Gunshot]
"
,,
4,1,"You know, I know this is the wrong time
"
,,
4,1,"to be star struck...
"
,,
4,1,"but Mel Gibson is shooting at us.
"
,,
4,1,"[Lois screaming]
"
,,
4,1,"Peter, help!
"
,,
4,1,"Oh, man. I'm coming, Lois.
"
,,
4,1,"Lois, look. I'm a booger.
"
,,
4,1," Peter, for God's sake!
"
,,
4,1," Okay. Grab my hand.
"
,,
4,1,"And now, Mr. Griffin, I want that film.
"
,,
4,1,"Sure. It's right over there
"
,,
4,1,"in President Rushmore's mouth.
"
,,
4,1,"My God! He just walked
"
,,
4,1,"right over the edge.
"
,,
4,1,"Of course, he did.
"
,,
4,1,"Christians don't believe in gravity.
"
,,
4,1," Peter, it's back.
"
,,
4,1," What, that rash?
"
,,
4,1,"No, the spark.
"
,,
4,1,"Honey, I have never been
"
,,
4,1,"more attracted to you than I am right now.
"
,,
4,1,"Really? Wow!
"
,,
4,1,"So I guess this honeymoon
"
,,
4,1,"was just the kind of excitement...
"
,,
4,1,"our marriage needed.
"
,,
4,1," I guess it just goes to show that you...
"
,,
4,1," Shut up and let's do it!
"
,,
4,1,"[Peter and Lois giggling]
"
,,
4,1,"LOIS: Peter!
"
,,
4,1,"PETER: Yes!
"
,,
4,1,"Hey, Jefferson, check it out.
"
,,
4,1,"A chick getting nailed on my head.
"
,,
4,1,"Sweet. Hey, Teddy, pass the word
"
,,
4,1,"down to Frankenstein.
"
,,
4,1,"Oh, ha-ha!
"
,,
4,1,"So you actually put coke
"
,,
4,1,"in that kid's locker?
"
,,
4,1," Yup.
"
,,
4,1," Where'd you get it?
"
,,
4,1,"I got a guy.
"
,,
4,1,"Don't let it get the best of you.
"
,,
4,1,"I used to be a lawyer.
"
,,
4,1,"See you next week.
"
,,
4,1,"Good to be back, America.
"
,,
4,1,"Everybody, I got bad news.
"
,,
4,1,"We've been cancelled.
"
,,
4,1,"Oh no, Peter, how could they do that?
"
,,
4,1,"Unfortunately, lois, there's just
"
,,
4,1,"no more room on the schedule.
"
,,
4,1,"We've just got to accept the fact that
"
,,
4,1,"Fox has to make room for terrific shows...
"
,,
4,1,"Like Dark Angel, Titus, Undeclared...
"
,,
4,1,"Action, That Eighties Show...
"
,,
4,1,"Wonderfalls, Fastlane,
"
,,
4,1,"Andy Richter Controls the Universe...
"
,,
4,1,"Skin, Girls Club, Cracking Up...
"
,,
4,1,"The Pitts, Firefly, Get Real...
"
,,
4,1,"Freakylinks, Wanda at large,
"
,,
4,1,"Costello, The lone Gunmen...
"
,,
4,1,"A Minute with Stan Hooper,
"
,,
4,1,"Normal, Ohio, Pasadena...
"
,,
4,1,"Harsh Realm, Keen Eddie, The Street,
"
,,
4,1,"American Embassy...
"
,,
4,1,"Cedric the Entertainer,
"
,,
4,1,"The Tick, louie, and Greg the Bunny,
"
,,
4,1,"Is there no hope?
"
,,
4,1,"Well, I suppose if all those shows
"
,,
4,1,"go down the tubes, we might have a shot.
"
,,
4,1,"It seems today that all you see
"
,,
4,1,"Is violence in movies and sex on TV
"
,,
4,1,"But where are those
"
,,
4,1,"good old-fashioned values
"
,,
4,1,"On which we used to rely?
"
,,
4,1,"Lucky there's a family guy
"
,,
4,1,"lucky there's a man who
"
,,
4,1,"Positively can do
"
,,
4,1,"All the things that make us
"
,,
4,1,"laugh and cry
"
,,
4,1,"He's a family guy
"
,,
4,1," What are you watching, Peter?
"
,,
4,1," Passion of the Christ,
"
,,
4,1,"I tell you, Brian, I can't belleve
"
,,
4,1,"that this guy's just lying there taking it.
"
,,
4,1,"If it was me, I would have done
"
,,
4,1,"something about it.
"
,,
4,1,"Hey!
"
,,
4,1,"Hey, hey.
"
,,
4,1,"Stop it.
"
,,
4,1," Okay.
"
,,
4,1," Okay?
"
,,
4,1," Okay.
"
,,
4,1," All right.
"
,,
4,1," Hi, boys.
"
,,
4,1," I didn't have my hands down my pants.
"
,,
4,1,"Good for you.
"
,,
4,1,"I just bought us some new sheets
"
,,
4,1,"at Bed Bath and Beyond.
"
,,
4,1,"Boy, I hope you stayed away
"
,,
4,1,"from that Beyond section.
"
,,
4,1,"Here are the coffee mugs.
"
,,
4,1,"Honey, what do you say
"
,,
4,1,"we christen these new sheets?
"
,,
4,1,"Why, lois Griffin, you naughty girI.
"
,,
4,1," That's me.
"
,,
4,1," You dirty hustler.
"
,,
4,1," You filthy, stinky prostitute.
"
,,
4,1," Okay, I get it.
"
,,
4,1,"You fouI, venereaI-disease-carrying,
"
,,
4,1,"streetwalking whore.
"
,,
4,1,"All right, that's enough.
"
,,
4,1,"It's good to have land.
"
,,
4,1,"George!
"
,,
4,1," George? Who the hell is George?
"
,,
4,1," George Clooney.
"
,,
4,1,"Our sex is so dull for you that you
"
,,
4,1,"got to fantasize about George Clooney?
"
,,
4,1,"I'm sorry, honey.
"
,,
4,1,"I guess that things have become
"
,,
4,1,"a little stale for me.
"
,,
4,1,"I don't know what to do.
"
,,
4,1,"I mean, I don't really know that much
"
,,
4,1,"about any kinky stuff.
"
,,
4,1,"I mean, I could hook this car battery
"
,,
4,1,"up to my nipples.
"
,,
4,1,"Oh, God!
"
,,
4,1,"Ow! Ow! Ow!
"
,,
4,1,"This doing it for you?
"
,,
4,1,"I don't know.
"
,,
4,1,"I just don't feeI that spark anymore.
"
,,
4,1,"I mean, our honeymoon.
"
,,
4,1,"So much rug burn!
"
,,
4,1,"Wait a second, lois. That's what we need.
"
,,
4,1,"We'll go on a second honeymoon.
"
,,
4,1,"Peter, that's a wonderfuI idea!
"
,,
4,1,"Yeah. We'll be just like
"
,,
4,1,"The Honeymooners!
"
,,
4,1,"One of these days, Alice,
"
,,
4,1,"One of these days...,
"
,,
4,1,"Yeah, yeah, I know, Ralph,
"
,,
4,1,"Right to the moon,
"
,,
4,1,"Well, that's everything.
"
,,
4,1,"Now, remember, kids...
"
,,
4,1,"Brian is in charge while your father and I
"
,,
4,1,"are out at Cape Cod.
"
,,
4,1,"I'll take good care of them, lois.
"
,,
4,1,"You guys have a good time.
"
,,
4,1," Be good.
"
,,
4,1," Bye, Mom, I love you!
"
,,
4,1,"Brian, if I choose to make
"
,,
4,1,"stooI in my pants right now...
"
,,
4,1,"you're the only one here to change me.
"
,,
4,1,"What do you think of that?
"
,,
4,1," I'm not gonna change you.
"
,,
4,1," What?
"
,,
4,1," I said, I'm not going to change you.
"
,,
4,1," You can't be serious.
"
,,
4,1,"What if I make a fudgie?
"
,,
4,1,"I just won't, that's all. I just won't.
"
,,
4,1,"Blast, I just did!
"
,,
4,1,"Chris, cut it out!
"
,,
4,1,"Brian, Chris just picked his nose
"
,,
4,1,"and he keeps touching me with his finger!
"
,,
4,1,"What good is mining nose gold
"
,,
4,1,"if I can't share it with the townspeople?
"
,,
4,1,"I swear to God, these kids are gonna
"
,,
4,1,"make me put a bullet through my head.
"
,,
4,1,"If I was in charge,
"
,,
4,1,"we wouldn't be having this problem.
"
,,
4,1,"You got some ideas? Tell me.
"
,,
4,1,"I'll tell you.
"
,,
4,1,"Of course, I'll want a favor in exchange.
"
,,
4,1,"How does it smell, dog?
"
,,
4,1,"Does it smell like servitude?
"
,,
4,1,"Aft torpedoes, fire!
"
,,
4,1,"lois?
"
,,
4,1,"Hey, lois, honey?
"
,,
4,1,"Sweetheart?
"
,,
4,1,"You're awake!
"
,,
4,1," Hey, can you hand me the pretzels?
"
,,
4,1," Here. Where are we?
"
,,
4,1,"About two hours from Cape Cod's
"
,,
4,1,"most luxurious bed and breakfast.
"
,,
4,1,"Peter, this is gonna be wonderfuI.
"
,,
4,1,"I'm so excited
"
,,
4,1,"I want to prep my diaphragm now.
"
,,
4,1,"Gross. Hey, why don't you
"
,,
4,1,"go back to sleep?
"
,,
4,1," I'll wake you up when we get there.
"
,,
4,1," Okay.
"
,,
4,1,"look at all those hamburgers.
"
,,
4,1,"You can't eat all those hamburgers,
"
,,
4,1,"you stupid fellow!
"
,,
4,1,"He's gonna do it! He's so ridiculous.
"
,,
4,1,"You hear me, you ridiculous man? You're-
"
,,
4,1,"Peter, what the hell is wrong with you?
"
,,
4,1,"I fall asleep for 10 minutes...
"
,,
4,1,"and you plow the car into a tree?
"
,,
4,1,"Oh, my God! You got to pay attention
"
,,
4,1,"to the road. We could have been killed!
"
,,
4,1,"I mean, look at the front of our car.
"
,,
4,1,"It's totaled. It's completely totaled, Peter!
"
,,
4,1,"This is just terrific.
"
,,
4,1,"How are we gonna get-
"
,,
4,1,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
4,1,"I knew I should have driven.
"
,,
4,1,"I should always drive.
"
,,
4,1,"I cannot trust you, Peter Griffin!
"
,,
4,1,"Dear God, this is where we're sleeping?
"
,,
4,1,"Come on, lois. They said
"
,,
4,1,"they'd have the car fixed by tomorrow.
"
,,
4,1,"And then our second honeymoon's back
"
,,
4,1,"on track.
"
,,
4,1,"Peter, there's a hooker on the bed.
"
,,
4,1," Hi.
"
,,
4,1," Stand perfectly still, lois.
"
,,
4,1,"Their vision is based on movement.
"
,,
4,1,"Where did you go?
"
,,
4,1,"And now back to Two and a Half Men.
"
,,
4,1,"Kill me!
"
,,
4,1,"Turn it, Chris.
"
,,
4,1,"I want to watch George lopez,
"
,,
4,1,"That show only furthers the stereotype
"
,,
4,1,"that George lopez is funny.
"
,,
4,1," Give me that!
"
,,
4,1," Chris, Give me the remote.
"
,,
4,1," Chris, stop!
"
,,
4,1," Stop doing that!
"
,,
4,1,"My hat!
"
,,
4,1,"Wear it now.
"
,,
4,1,"You two better settle down.
"
,,
4,1," Chris, give Meg her hat.
"
,,
4,1," I don't have to listen to you.
"
,,
4,1,"You're a dog! You don't have a souI!
"
,,
4,1,"Ow.
"
,,
4,1,"Don't take that. Raise your voice to them.
"
,,
4,1,"Hey! Knock it off!
"
,,
4,1,"look, you kids are obviously in need
"
,,
4,1,"of some type of activity.
"
,,
4,1,"I don't know. What do you say
"
,,
4,1,"we read a book or something?
"
,,
4,1,"Stewie, what does Peter have
"
,,
4,1,"on his bookshelf?
"
,,
4,1,"Two Garfield books and the novellzation
"
,,
4,1,"of the movie Caddyshack,
"
,,
4,1,"""Mananananana,"" said Ty,
"
,,
4,1,"sinking yet another ball.
"
,,
4,1,"""Mananananana-"" Hang on.
"
,,
4,1,"Thank God.
"
,,
4,1,"""Garfield at large, by Jim Davis. ""
"
,,
4,1,"Now, as you can see in this paneI,
"
,,
4,1,"Garfield doesn't care for NermaI.
"
,,
4,1,"But like him or not, NermaI is here to stay.
"
,,
4,1,"Or is he? let's read on.
"
,,
4,1,"Okay, I'll be there.
"
,,
4,1,"Peter and lois were supposed to
"
,,
4,1,"chaperone Chris' schooI dance...
"
,,
4,1,"tomorrow night. So, I guess it's up to me.
"
,,
4,1,"You mean it's up to us. Clearly you
"
,,
4,1,"need my help with this parenting thing.
"
,,
4,1,"You're too stupid to do it alone.
"
,,
4,1,"Besides, I know how to deaI with
"
,,
4,1,"children, unlike Mr. Geppetto.
"
,,
4,1,"Oh, no. I dropped my glasses.
"
,,
4,1,"By the way, Pinocchio,
"
,,
4,1,"there was a cookie missing from the jar.
"
,,
4,1,"Did you take it by any chance?
"
,,
4,1,"Yes, Papa Geppetto. I'm sorry.
"
,,
4,1,"Are you sure you took it? Because
"
,,
4,1,"I'd believe you if you said you didn't.
"
,,
4,1,"No, I took it, Papa. I wouldn't lie to you.
"
,,
4,1,"You could try. Who knows?
"
,,
4,1,"You might get away with it.
"
,,
4,1,"$900 to fix the car.
"
,,
4,1,"That was all the money we had
"
,,
4,1,"for this trip.
"
,,
4,1,"look, Peter, this second honeymoon
"
,,
4,1,"was a nice thought...
"
,,
4,1,"but maybe we should just go home.
"
,,
4,1,"Coming up, handsome mustachioed man
"
,,
4,1,"recaps news in pleasing baritone,
"
,,
4,1,"Stay tuned for this and more,
"
,,
4,1,"But first, Asian reporter Tricia Takanawa
"
,,
4,1,"is on hand for the opening...
"
,,
4,1,"of Manhattan's newest luxury hotel,
"
,,
4,1,"Diane, I am standing outside the
"
,,
4,1,"Park Barrington Hotel...
"
,,
4,1,"because they don't allow Asians inside,
"
,,
4,1,"Fancy place. Boy, that'd make
"
,,
4,1,"some second honeymoon.
"
,,
4,1,"The Park Barrington is already attracting
"
,,
4,1,"some big names,
"
,,
4,1,"Such as Christianity enthusiast
"
,,
4,1,"Mel Gibson, who has his own room...
"
,,
4,1,"on permanent reserve,
"
,,
4,1,"A room which he barely uses,
"
,,
4,1,"Barely uses? lois, I just got an idea!
"
,,
4,1,"Much better than that time
"
,,
4,1,"I experimented with gene splicing.
"
,,
4,1,"lois, quick question.
"
,,
4,1,"Do we have any TylenoI?
"
,,
4,1,"How I envy them, dog. They've got
"
,,
4,1,"their whole lives ahead of them.
"
,,
4,1,"Man, look at that kid.
"
,,
4,1,"That is one ugly eighth grader.
"
,,
4,1,"You don't want to hurt yourself dancing.
"
,,
4,1,"Make sure you stretch out
"
,,
4,1,"those creamy hamstrings.
"
,,
4,1,"Come on, Chris. It's just vodka.
"
,,
4,1,"Jake swiped it
"
,,
4,1,"from his dad's liquor cabinet.
"
,,
4,1,"Yeah, see? It's good.
"
,,
4,1,"Well, okay. Maybe just one sip.
"
,,
4,1,"Christopher Griffin, is that alcohoI?
"
,,
4,1,"Mister, you're in serious trouble.
"
,,
4,1,"He's absolutely right, kids.
"
,,
4,1,"Because when you drink, nobody wins.
"
,,
4,1,"In fact, last year alone,
"
,,
4,1,"there were over 27,000 deaths from...
"
,,
4,1,"chronic liver disease
"
,,
4,1,"as a result of alcohoI abuse.
"
,,
4,1," Now we know.
"
,,
4,1," And knowing is half the battle.
"
,,
4,1,"G.I. Joe!
"
,,
4,1," Peter, we can't afford this.
"
,,
4,1," No, but MeI Gibson can.
"
,,
4,1,"Excuse me, I'm MeI Gibson, here for
"
,,
4,1,"the key to my specially reserved room.
"
,,
4,1,"You're MeI Gibson?
"
,,
4,1,"Yes, I've put on a few pounds
"
,,
4,1,"for my next role.
"
,,
4,1,"I play Peter Griffin, a heroic warrior
"
,,
4,1,"who defied the English to free England...
"
,,
4,1," from the English.
"
,,
4,1," Holy mackereI!
"
,,
4,1,"let me show you
"
,,
4,1,"to your room, Mr. Gibson!
"
,,
4,1,"Peter, the toilet paper is made of money.
"
,,
4,1,"Yeah, and look at this. They even got
"
,,
4,1,"some of that high-class British porn.
"
,,
4,1,"Almost, Almost, Almost,
"
,,
4,1," There we are,
"
,,
4,1," Well done,
"
,,
4,1,"Did you think you were cooI?
"
,,
4,1,"Did you think you were grown up?
"
,,
4,1,"I didn't actually drink any of it.
"
,,
4,1,"Besides, Jake Tucker gave it to me.
"
,,
4,1,"We are going to have a talk with Jake's
"
,,
4,1,"parents tomorrow after my burping.
"
,,
4,1,"And, in the meantime,
"
,,
4,1,"you're grounded, Chris.
"
,,
4,1,"Come on. That sucks!
"
,,
4,1," Do you want us to pull over?
"
,,
4,1," I don't care what you do!
"
,,
4,1,"We'll pull over. We'll pull over. Pull over.
"
,,
4,1,"If your teachers ask about your bruises,
"
,,
4,1,"what do you tell them?
"
,,
4,1,"I got hit by a baseball!
"
,,
4,1," MeI!
"
,,
4,1," MeI? Wait a minute.
"
,,
4,1,"You were fantasizing about MeI Gibson.
"
,,
4,1,"You don't find me attractive anymore.
"
,,
4,1,"Honey, I'm sorry. I know you're trying.
"
,,
4,1,"But you can't force the spark
"
,,
4,1,"back into our marriage.
"
,,
4,1,"Well, then I guess this whole second
"
,,
4,1,"honeymoon was a waste of time.
"
,,
4,1," Peter-
"
,,
4,1," I don't want to talk about it!
"
,,
4,1,"I'm just gonna watch British porn.
"
,,
4,1,"You know, Margaret, we could have
"
,,
4,1,"sexual intercourse right now,
"
,,
4,1," Yes, yes we could,
"
,,
4,1," But, let's not,
"
,,
4,1,"Do you think we were too hard
"
,,
4,1,"on Chris tonight?
"
,,
4,1,"What? Oh, God, no.
"
,,
4,1,"No, no. I don't...
"
,,
4,1,"I don't think so.
"
,,
4,1,"Do you?
"
,,
4,1,"No, I just always feeI badly
"
,,
4,1,"when we have to be strict.
"
,,
4,1,"Did I remember to turn the stove off?
"
,,
4,1,"Yes.
"
,,
4,1,"I'm sorry for everything
"
,,
4,1,"that's happened, Peter.
"
,,
4,1,"I guess I'm going through a phase
"
,,
4,1,"right now...
"
,,
4,1,"where I'm only attracted
"
,,
4,1,"to handsome men.
"
,,
4,1,"Well, what are we supposed to do, lois?
"
,,
4,1,"Just admit that there's no excitement
"
,,
4,1,"left in our marriage?
"
,,
4,1,"Go home and spend the rest of our lives
"
,,
4,1,"looking at each other...
"
,,

4,1," Go to hell, Tom.
"
,,
4,1," Already there, hon.
"
,,
4,1,"Yes, well, Mr. Tucker, it seems
"
,,
4,1,"your son Jake had some vodka...
"
,,
4,1,"at the schooI dance
"
,,
4,1,"and Chris got blamed for it.
"
,,
4,1,"This whole situation has just turned

,,
4,1,"his whole life upside-down face.
"
,,
4,1,"It's no concern of mine if it's turned
"
,,
4,1,"his life upside-down face.
"
,,
4,1," Jake's a good boy. Aren't you, Jake?
"
,,
4,1," Yeah!
"
,,
4,1," look, Mr. Tucker, I-
"
,,
4,1," We're through here.
"
,,
4,1,"Get out of my house, Benji!
"
,,
4,1,"Fine! If you're gonna be that way
"
,,
4,1,"about it, maybe I'll do this.
"
,,
4,1," Yeah, look at this.
"
,,
4,1," Stop that!
"
,,
4,1,"Yeah, you don't like this, huh?
"
,,
4,1," This is what Benji would do.
"
,,
4,1," Stop doing that in my carpet!
"
,,
4,1," Knock it off! Stop it!
"
,,
4,1," That feels so good.
"
,,
4,1,"There's got to be a way to get back
"
,,
4,1,"at Jake Tucker for what he did to Chris.
"
,,
4,1,"I know! let's plant drugs in his locker.
"
,,
4,1," Oh, my God! That's a great idea.
"
,,
4,1," Yeah, thought you'd like that.
"
,,
4,1,"Hey, look at that Yosemite Sam mud flap.
"
,,
4,1,"You had better stay back, Brian.
"
,,
4,1,"I think we lost them.
"

4,1,"You stay here. I'm gonna go bury this fllm.
"
,,
4,1,"Well, MeI Gibson,
"
,,
4,1,"this is one piece of crap...
"
,,
4,1,"the world wllI never have to
"
,,
4,1,"suffer through.
"
,,
4,1,"I am so clever.
"
,,
4,1,"That's why they picked me
"
,,
4,1,"to convince Congress to go to war.
"
,,
4,1,"There is no just cause
"
,,
4,1,"for an invasion of Iraq.
"
,,
4,1,"Well, that may be.
"
,,
4,1,"But what we're all forgetting is...
"
,,
4,1,"anyone who doesn't
"
,,
4,1,"want to go to war is gay.
"
,,
4,1," I want to go to war.
"
,,
4,1," Yes.
"
,,
4,1," We should definitely go.
"
,,
4,1," Yes, we should totally go to war.
"
,,
4,1,"I was the first one who wanted to
"
,,
4,1,"go to war.
"
,,
4,1,"Peter!
"
,,
4,1,"lois!
"
,,
4,1,"Don't take this personally, Mrs. Griffin.
"
,,
4,1,"I'm doing this because I have to.
"
,,
4,1,"What are you gonna do to me?
"
,,
4,1,"What are you gonna do to me?
"
,,
4,1,"As soon as your husband gives me
"
,,
4,1,"what I want, you're free to go.
"
,,
4,1,"Anybody home?
"

"
,,
4,1,"Don't worry, lois.
"
,,
4,1,"There's a dog turd in there.

4,1,"But by the time he finds out,

,,
4,1,"We're on top of the monument.

4,1,"You know, I know this is the wrong time
"

4,1,"to be star struck...
"
,,
4,1,"but MeI Gibson is shooting at us.

4,1," Peter, for God's sake!
"
,,
4,1," Okay. Grab my hand.
"
,,
4,1,"And now, Mr. Griffin, I want that fllm.
"
,,
4,1,"Sure. It's right over there
"
,,
4,1,"in President Rushmore's mouth.
"
,,
4,1,"My God! He just walked
"
,,
4,1,"right over the edge.
"
,,
4,1,"Of course, he did.
"
,,
4,1,"Christians don't belleve in gravity.
"
,,
4,1," Peter, it's back.
"
,,
4,1," What, that rash?
"
,,
4,1,"No, the spark.
"
,,
4,1,"Honey, I have never been
"
,,
4,1,"more attracted to you than I am right now.
"
,,
4,1,"Really? Wow!
"
,,
4,1,"So I guess this honeymoon
"
,,
4,1,"was just the kind of excitement...
"
,,
4,1,"our marriage needed.
"
,,
4,1," I guess it just goes to show that you-

4,2," Yo, it's my turn to deliver.
"
,,
4,2,"Can I have this one?
"
,,
4,2,"My mom keeps giving mine away.
"
,,
4,2,"Dad, I need some advice. I need to know
"
,,
4,2,"how to get a girl to like me.
"
,,
4,2,"Chris, buddy, there's a million ways
"
,,
4,2,"to do that.
"
,,
4,2,"You just got to do something simple,
"
,,
4,2,"like Vincent van Gogh.
"
,,
4,2,"It's... What is this?
"
,,
4,2,"It's my ear. Do you like it?
"
,,
4,2,"You don't like it.
"
,,
4,2,"No, I like it. But it's just... Why your ear?
"
,,
4,2,"Because I love you.
"
,,
4,2,"Well, at least this will be a funny story
"
,,
4,2,"to tell our kids someday.
"
,,
4,2,"You want kids? Oh, yikes.
"
,,
4,2,"I wish you'd told me that
"
,,
4,2,"before I got you this.
"
,,
4,2,"Did I hear my big boy say he's got
"
,,
4,2,"a crush on some lucky girl?
"
,,
4,2,"You know, Chris, I knew this day
"
,,
4,2,"would come. So, I brought you a condom.
"
,,
4,2,"Use it wisely, though.
"
,,
4,2,"It wasn't easy to obtain.
"
,,
4,2,"[Man and woman moaning]
"
,,
4,2,"MAN: What the hell are you doing?
"
,,
4,2,"WOMAN: Give that back!
"
,,
4,2,"MAN: Man!
"
,,
4,2,"WOMAN: Now, where were we?
"
,,
4,2,"MAN: This is much better.
"
,,
4,2,"Chris, honey, the way to win a girl is
"
,,
4,2,"to do something romantic and unexpected.
"
,,
4,2,"Remember the naked spaceman, Lois?
"
,,
4,2,"Yeah. You remember the naked spaceman.
"
,,
4,2,"On my 25th birthday,
"
,,
4,2,"your father surprised me by showing up...
"
,,
4,2,"in nothing but a space helmet
"
,,
4,2,"and moon boots.
"
,,
4,2,"It just came to me.
"
,,
4,2," You want some Tang, Mr. Spaceman?
"
,,
4,2," Do I?
"
,,
4,2,"Just remember, fat man,
"
,,
4,2,"those jugs are mine until the milk dries up.
"
,,
4,2,"Then you can have the remains.
"
,,
4,2,"So, basically, what Orwell was saying
"
,,
4,2,"was, ""It's not perfect but I'll take it.""
"
,,
4,2,"All right, moving on...
"
,,
4,2,"CHRIS: Sorry, I'm late, Mrs. Lockhart.
"
,,
4,2,"Oh, my God, Chris! What are you doing?
"
,,
4,2,"Being romantic and unexpected.
"
,,
4,2,"Chris, you can't be so impulsive.
"
,,
4,2,"People have gotten
"
,,
4,2,"into a lot of trouble that way.
"
,,
4,2," Marie?
"
,,
4,2," Yeah, Donny?
"
,,
4,2,"We cannot tell Mom.
"
,,
4,2,"So, Chris, what's the latest with
"
,,
4,2,"your little girlfriend?
"
,,
4,2,"I don't think Mrs. Lockhart likes me at all.
"
,,
4,2,"Mrs. Lockhart? Your teacher?
"
,,
4,2,"Whoa!
"
,,
4,2,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
"
,,
4,2,"Lois, this is not my Batman glass.
"
,,
4,2,"Peter, are you listening?
"
,,
4,2,"Chris has a crush on his teacher.
"
,,
4,2,"Gross!
"
,,
4,2,"You know what else is gross?
"
,,
4,2,"[Farts]
"
,,
4,2,"Broke a damn blood vessel!
"
,,
4,2,"How's it coming, dog?
"
,,
4,2,"God! Just listen to this kid's report
"
,,
4,2,"on <i>Great Expectations.</i>
"
,,
4,2,"""Miss Havisham should have throwed
"
,,
4,2,"that cake out so it don't like...
"
,,
4,2,"""mess all up the bitch's house.""
"
,,
4,2,"I don't know what to do, you know?
"
,,
4,2,"Society's given up on these kids.
"
,,
4,2,"I feel like I may be the only one
"
,,
4,2,"who can help them.
"
,,
4,2,"I think your problem is
"
,,
4,2,"you're not communicating in a way...
"
,,
4,2,"that speaks to their experience.
"
,,
4,2,"You know what you should do?
"
,,
4,2,"Get in there tomorrow and do the robot.
"
,,
4,2,"Wow. You know, you're right.
"
,,
4,2,"Maybe I should just try...
"
,,
4,2,"a whole new approach. Thanks.
"
,,
4,2,"[Funky music playing on stereo]
"
,,
4,2,"Okay, you can stop that now.
"
,,
4,2,"I can't hear you. I'm a robot.
"
,,
4,2," Come on, knock it off.
"
,,
4,2," Does not compute.
"
,,
4,2," I'm going to bed.
"
,,
4,2," I do not require sleep.
"
,,
4,2,"Let's see the kid with the hearing aid
"
,,
4,2,"from <i>Barney</i> do this.
"
,,
4,2,"All right. So's I'm chilling in Verona
"
,,
4,2,"when my homie busts out with:
"
,,
4,2,"""Yo, Romeo. Check out
"
,,
4,2,"that biotch Juliet in the window.""
"
,,
4,2,"Problem is, Juliet's peeps are, like,
"
,,
4,2,"East Coast rappers...
"
,,
4,2,"and my posse's representing West Side.
"
,,
4,2,"Just like my boys Tupac and Biggie.
"
,,
4,2,"Know what I'm saying?
"
,,
4,2," That's racist, man.
"
,,
4,2," Yeah, that's just straight ignorant, dog.
"
,,
4,2,"It's good to meet you, Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.
"
,,
4,2,"We wanted to talk to you about
"
,,
4,2,"our son. You see, Chris really...
"
,,
4,2,"Lois, honey, let's make sure
"
,,
4,2,"we do this delicately, all right?
"
,,
4,2,"Mrs. Lockhart, our son...
"
,,
4,2,"would like to plow you.
"
,,
4,2,"I had a feeling that's what was going on.
"
,,
4,2,"Sorry. Our son can sometimes be a boob.
"
,,
4,2,"I mean a melon.
"
,,
4,2,"I mean, a sopping-wet pair of breasts
"
,,
4,2,"barely covered by a racing t-shirt.
"
,,
4,2,"Mrs. Lockhart,
"
,,
4,2,"we just wanted you to know...
"
,,
4,2,"so you could spare his feelings
"
,,
4,2,"and let him down gently.
"
,,
4,2,"Don't worry.
"
,,
4,2,"I know exactly what to say to Chris.
"
,,
4,2,"Thank you so much.
"
,,
4,2,"You've been very understanding.
"
,,
4,2,"Gosh. You know, I don't mean to impose,
"
,,
4,2,"but do you have a picture of yourself...
"
,,
4,2,"that I could tape
"
,,
4,2,"to the back of Lois's head?
"
,,
4,2,"[Rapping on window]
"
,,
4,2," Mrs. Lockhart?
"
,,
4,2," Chris, come down here.
"
,,
4,2,"I need to talk to you.
"
,,
4,2,"Why are you here?
"
,,
4,2,"'Cause I couldn't stand to be away
"
,,
4,2,"from you for another moment.
"
,,
4,2,"I think I'm falling in love with you.
"
,,
4,2," I love you, too!
"
,,
4,2," The only problem is I'm married.
"
,,
4,2,"Therefore, there's only one thing to do.
"
,,
4,2,"Make a flip book of a stick figure
"
,,
4,2,"whose head gets bigger and bigger...
"
,,
4,2,"and bigger and then pops?
"
,,
4,2,"This isn't a flip book, Chris.
"
,,
4,2,"They're instructions.
"
,,
4,2,"If we're going to be together,
"
,,
4,2,"I need you to kill my husband.
"
,,
4,2,"Do you have any idea what time it is?
"
,,
4,2,"Get in the house, fatty!
"
,,
4,2,"Chris, you big beautiful man,
"
,,
4,2,"I'm so glad you came.
"
,,
4,2,"Up the stairs, second door on the left.
"
,,
4,2,"He should still be asleep.
"
,,
4,2," Mrs. Lockhart, I don't think I can do this.
"
,,
4,2," What?
"
,,
4,2,"Maybe you could just get a divorce,
"
,,
4,2,"and we could live together...
"
,,
4,2,"in the fort under my bed.
"
,,
4,2,"Fine. I'll do it myself. But we're through.
"
,,
4,2,"Okay. But I got to give you the password,
"
,,
4,2,"or you can't get into the fort.
"
,,
4,2,"[Door bangs shut]
"
,,
4,2,"It's taco. Taco!
"
,,
4,2,"Good God!
"
,,
4,2,"Look at the fat man's underwear.
"
,,
4,2,"It looks like a Jackson Pollock painting.
"
,,
4,2,"Don't put that in with my things!
"
,,
4,2,"What's this?
"
,,
4,2,"You know, Stewie, Mommy doesn't
"
,,
4,2,"usually read things out of Chris's pockets.
"
,,
4,2,"She's more respectful than that.
"
,,
4,2,"Yeah, whatever helps you
"
,,
4,2,"sleep at night, bitch.
"
,,
4,2,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
4,2,"Chris is gonna murder
"
,,
4,2,"Mrs. Lockhart's husband!
"
,,
4,2,"We got to stop him!
"
,,
4,2,"Can we stop at the supermarket?
"
,,
4,2,"I want a Granny Smith apple.
"
,,
4,2,"How's your oatmeal, honey?
"
,,
4,2,"You know,
"
,,
4,2,"it tastes kind of different than usual.
"
,,
4,2,"Oh, my God! There's a bear in my oatmeal.
"
,,
4,2,"[Mr. Lockhart screaming]
"
,,
4,2,"[Bear growling]
"
,,
4,2,"Yeah, I know. I'm late.
"
,,
4,2,"Okay, let's just get started.
"
,,
4,2,"Yo, man, what's that thing in the middle?
"
,,
4,2,"What, this?
"
,,
4,2,"You got to be freaking kidding me.
"
,,
4,2,"That's an ampersand.
"
,,
4,2,"It's a symbol for the word ""and.""
"
,,
4,2,"My God, nobody can be this stupid.
"
,,
4,2,"Not even Peter when he took...
"
,,
4,2,"that blow to the head and thought he was
"
,,
4,2,"Larry from <i>Three's Company.</i>
"
,,
4,2,"Jack, there's a hot tub party
"
,,
4,2,"across the street and we're invited.
"
,,
4,2,"And don't worry. If Mr. Furley comes by,
"
,,
4,2,"I'll make sure he thinks you're...
"
,,
4,2,"Mr. Griffin, chillax.
"
,,
4,2,"We're doing the best we can.
"
,,
4,2,"There is nothing I would like to do
"
,,
4,2,"more than chillax, Amanda.
"
,,
4,2,"But without a decent education,
"
,,
4,2,"you could spend the rest of your life...
"
,,
4,2,"as a ditch digger or a motel maid
"
,,
4,2,"or a hooker.
"
,,
4,2," I could be a ditch digger?
"
,,
4,2," A motel maid?
"
,,
4,2,"I could be a hooker?
"
,,
4,2,"Well, no. You don't want to be a hooker.
"
,,
4,2,"Wow, Mr. Griffin! You're the first teacher
"
,,
4,2,"that ever told us we could do anything.
"
,,
4,2,"Well, I didn't mean sell your body
"
,,
4,2,"for money.
"
,,
4,2,"""O, Captain! my Captain!""
"
,,
4,2,"No, you're actually misunderstanding.
"
,,
4,2,"""O, Captain! my Captain!""
"
,,
4,2,"Well, if it works for you, I guess...
"
,,
4,2,"""O, Captain! my Captain!""
"
,,
4,2,"What the hell?
"
,,
4,2,"Be the best damn hooker you can be.
"
,,
4,2,"""O, Captain! my Captain!""
"
,,
4,2,"In your case, I'd get the money up front.
"
,,
4,2,"[Groaning]
"
,,
4,2,"Jack, twins! Swedish. My place. Now.
"
,,
4,2,"We're too late! Oh, my God.
"
,,
4,2,"Okay, I gotta call the police.
"
,,
4,2,"What's that smell?
"
,,
4,2,"Dead body, right. That's what that is.
"
,,
4,2,"I just had a dream I was an egg, and I was
"
,,
4,2,"being hatched by Elisabeth Hasselbeck.
"
,,
4,2,"No, wait a minute. I can't call the police.
"
,,
4,2,"I have to get rid of this body,
"
,,
4,2,"or Chris'll go to prison!
"
,,
4,2,"And we all know what happens in those
"
,,
4,2,"prison showers. I've seen <i>Oz.</i>
"
,,
4,2,"All right, wait here, Stewie,
"
,,
4,2,"while Mommy gets the cement blocks.
"
,,
4,2," Everything all right here?
"
,,
4,2," Fine, Officer. Just enjoying the sunset.
"
,,
4,2,"No law against that, is there?
"
,,
4,2," What happened to your shirt?
"
,,
4,2," You know, just a pizza party at the office.
"
,,
4,2,"Yeah? Where do you work?
"
,,
4,2,"First Fidelity Insurance
"
,,
4,2,"over on Wabossette Street.
"
,,
4,2," My cousin, Arnie, works over there.
"
,,
4,2," Arnie's your cousin, is he?
"
,,
4,2," You know him?
"
,,
4,2," Somewhat.
"
,,
4,2,"Good middle-management type.
"
,,
4,2,"Just blends in with the furniture there.
"
,,
4,2,"Never really wowed anyone at the office.
"
,,
4,2,"Yeah, that's always been Arnie's problem.
"
,,
4,2,"Well, take it easy.
"
,,
4,2,"Yes. You, too.
"
,,
4,2,"And if you see Arnie, tell him:
"
,,
4,2,"[Gibbering]
"
,,
4,2,"He'll know what it means.
"
,,
4,2,"You know what I hate?
"
,,
4,2,"A guy in a blue suit.
"
,,
4,2,"[Exclaims]
"
,,
4,2,"There's one right behind me, isn't there?
"
,,
4,2,"You know, Lois, Chris is cool and
"
,,
4,2,"everything, but since he killed that guy...
"
,,
4,2,"I don't know. Maybe he shouldn't be
"
,,
4,2,"living with us here now.
"
,,
4,2,"Peter, I'm scared.
"
,,
4,2,"Don't worry, sweetheart.
"
,,
4,2,"You'll have plenty of time to escape...
"
,,
4,2,"while he's killing Meg.
"
,,
4,2,"He hates her the most.
"
,,
4,2,"Hey, everybody. What's for dinner?
"
,,
4,2,"I'm starving.
"
,,
4,2,"My God, his blood lust is unquenchable!
"
,,
4,2,"Chris, why don't you take your sister
"
,,
4,2,"into the kitchen for a sandwich?
"
,,
4,2,"I don't want to die!
"
,,
4,2,"Why is everybody acting weird?
"
,,
4,2,"Chris, honey, we know what you did.
"
,,
4,2,"And I have to say,
"
,,
4,2,"honestly, I don't approve.
"
,,
4,2,"What I did? That I lied about my age
"
,,
4,2,"to get into Indian Bingo?
"
,,
4,2,"No.
"
,,
4,2,"That I had hard gas and pooed myself?
"
,,
4,2,"Close, but still no.
"
,,
4,2,"How is that close?
"
,,
4,2,"For God's sake, Chris!
"
,,
4,2,"You murdered Mr. Lockhart!
"
,,
4,2,"What? No, I didn't!
"
,,
4,2,"Come on. Everybody's done
"
,,
4,2,"something they're not proud of.
"
,,
4,2,"Like when I used to be a Wonder Twin.
"
,,
4,2,"Peter, the old schoolhouse is on fire!
"
,,
4,2,"Let's go!
"
,,
4,2,"Wonder Twin powers, activate!
"
,,
4,2,"Form of a hawk!
"
,,
4,2," Come on, Peter.
"
,,
4,2," Yeah, I'll be right behind you.
"
,,
4,2,"Shape of Jayna's tampon.
"
,,
4,2,"PETER: And now I play the waiting game.
"
,,
4,2,"Chris, I saw the body.
"
,,
4,2,"Premeditated murder is one thing,
"
,,
4,2,"but I will not have lying in this house.
"
,,
4,2,"Wait, hold it.
"
,,
4,2,"Can we finish this after <i>Joan of Arcadia?</i>
"
,,
4,2,"Is <i>Joan of Arcadia</i> on?
"
,,
4,2,"All right.
"
,,
4,2,"Must be good.
"
,,
4,2,"Enjoyable program.
"
,,
4,2,"That's right, Diane.
"
,,
4,2,"It appears Ronald Lockhart...
"
,,
4,2,"has been brutally murdered by his wife,
"
,,
4,2,"Lana, and a local bear.
"
,,
4,2,"Well, I'll be damned.
"
,,
4,2,"Chris, I guess we owe you an apology.
"
,,
4,2,"That's okay. I just wonder what happened
"
,,
4,2,"to Ms. Lockhart and that bear.
"
,,
4,2,"The whereabouts of these suspects
"
,,
4,2,"are currently unknown.
"
,,
4,2," You ready?
"
,,
4,2," What's that?
"
,,
4,2,"I thought we'd try that lobster place
"
,,
4,2,"we passed in the car.
"
,,
4,2," Yeah, can I just finish watching this?
"
,,
4,2," You can watch TV anytime. I'm starving.
"
,,
4,2,"Lana, this is gonna be a real long trip
"
,,
4,2,"if you don't knock off the crap!
"
,,
4,2,"Love you.
"
,,
4,2,"In the television comedy
"
,,
4,2,"world, the people are entertained...
"
,,
4,2,"by two separate yet equally important
"
,,
4,2,"types of shows.
"
,,
4,2,"TraditionaI sitcoms that get laughs out
"
,,
4,2,"of everyday situations...
"
,,
4,2,"like trying to fix your own plumbing
"
,,
4,2,"or inviting two dates to the same dance.
"
,,
4,2,"And animated shows that make jokes
"
,,
4,2,"about farting. This is the latter.
"
,,
4,2,"Sorry. I just farted.
"
,,
4,2,"I'm glad you guys could come tonight.
"
,,
4,2,"Chris, honey, we wouldn't miss
"
,,
4,2,"your open house.
"
,,
4,2,"You kids are the most important thing
"
,,
4,2,"in our lives.
"
,,
4,2,"Oh, my God! We forgot Meg.
"
,,
4,2,"Don't worry about Meg. She's got
"
,,
4,2,"everything she needs in her room.
"
,,
4,2,"Most of the time,
"
,,
4,2,"the kids'll exercise out in the field.
"
,,
4,2,"But if it's raining or I'm hung-over,
"
,,
4,2,"they stay inside and play dodge ball.
"
,,
4,2,"I love dodge ball! Heads up!
"
,,
4,2,"And this week in Home Ec,
"
,,
4,2,"we're teaching your kids...
"
,,
4,2,"how to make bundt cake.
"
,,
4,2,"I love bundt cake! Heads up!
"
,,
4,2,"The schooI band offers a wide variety
"
,,
4,2,"of instruments...
"
,,
4,2,"from the kettledrum to the trombone.
"
,,
4,2,"I love the trombone!
"
,,
4,2,"Wow!
"
,,
4,2,"I know, isn't he wonderfuI?
"
,,
4,2,"He took lessons in junior college.
"
,,
4,2,"Heads up!
"
,,
4,2,"I like meeting Chris's teachers.
"
,,
4,2,"This ought to be more interesting than...
"
,,
4,2,"that time I met Ted Danson.
"
,,
4,2,"Wow! Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen!
"
,,
4,2,"Always nice to meet a fan.
"
,,
4,2,"Oh, shoot! I forgot my umbrella.
"
,,
4,2,"That's okay, honey. Come on over here.
"
,,
4,2,"Thanks, dear.
"
,,
4,2,"Sometimes it's good to be a freak.
"
,,
4,2,"Do you want to sleep together later?
"
,,
4,2,"No. Thanks, though.
"
,,
4,2,"Good evening, parents. I'm Ms. Clifton.
"
,,
4,2,"I'd like for you to fill out these...
"
,,
4,2,"contact information sheets.
"
,,
4,2,"Now, who would like to pass them out?
"
,,
4,2,"Ms. Clifton, over here!
"
,,
4,2,"Ms. Clifton! Ms. Clifton! Ms. Clifton!
"
,,
4,2,"Ms. Clifton! Ms. Clifton!
"
,,
4,2,"Mrs. Griffin.
"
,,
4,2,"I'm sorry. Will you all please excuse me
"
,,
4,2,"for a moment?
"
,,
4,2,"Tonight's winning
"
,,
4,2,"lottery numbers are...
"
,,
4,2,"Oh, my God! I won!
"
,,
4,2,"I'm free from all those
"
,,
4,2,"snot-nosed, little bastards!
"
,,
4,2,"I'm free!
"
,,
4,2," Is she coming back?
"
,,
4,2," I don't know.
"
,,
4,2,"I can't believe Ms. Clifton's gone.
"
,,
4,2,"Who's gonna teach my class now?
"
,,
4,2,"Brian, why don't you teach Chris's class?
"
,,
4,2,"You're very knowledgeable, the kids
"
,,
4,2,"might knock you down a few pegs...
"
,,
4,2,"which would be good for you.
"
,,
4,2,"You know, that is a terrific idea, Lois.
"
,,
4,2,"I probably have a lot to offer young people.
"
,,
4,2,"What's he going to teach them?
"
,,
4,2,"How to lick the Dorito crumbs
"
,,
4,2,"from between the sofa cushions?
"
,,
4,2,"Or how to leave a dead bird on the carpet?
"
,,
4,2,"That was a gift, you bastard.
"
,,
4,2,"That was a gift for the family.
"
,,
4,2,"Good morning, class.
"
,,
4,2,"I'm your substitute teacher, Brian Griffin.
"
,,
4,2,"Good morning, Mr. Griffin.
"
,,
4,2,"Please. Call me Brian.
"
,,
4,2,"Mr. Griffin is my father.
"
,,
4,2,"I thought your father's name was Cocoa,
"
,,
4,2,"and he was hit by a milk truck!
"
,,
4,2,"all right. Our goaI here is to gain
"
,,
4,2,"a command of the English language.
"
,,
4,2,"So you can be successfuI writers
"
,,
4,2,"like Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.
"
,,
4,2,"There. Finished.
"
,,
4,2,"Good Will Hunting by Matt Damon.
"
,,
4,2,"You think we could put
"
,,
4,2,"both our names on that?
"
,,
4,2,"What? You've done nothing
"
,,
4,2,"but eat Breyer's and smoke pot...
"
,,
4,2,"for the last six months.
"
,,
4,2,"Oh, that's... Come on! I helped.
"
,,
4,2,"Oh, yeah? Okay, write a line.
"
,,
4,2,"Just right now.
"
,,
4,2," Just pitch me a line right now.
"
,,
4,2," Okay.
"
,,
4,2,"How about that?
"
,,
4,2," That wasn't a line. You just farted.
"
,,
4,2," Is there anymore pot?
"
,,
4,2,"So, how was your first day, Mr. Kotter?
"
,,
4,2,"Yeah, Chris.
"
,,
4,2,"What's it like to have Brian as a teacher?
"
,,
4,2,"It sucks! Mr. Griffin gave me an F
"
,,
4,2,"on my first assignment!
"
,,
4,2,"What? An F, Brian?
"
,,
4,2,"After all Chris has done for you?
"
,,
4,2,"Yeah. Just kind of pull it out. Yeah.
"
,,
4,2,"If dogs aren't supposed to eat
"
,,
4,2,"dentaI floss out of the garbage...
"
,,
4,2,"why do they make it mint-flavored?
"
,,
4,2,"Chris, when I was in schooI,
"
,,
4,2,"you know what we used to do...
"
,,
4,2,"when a teacher gave us a bad grade?
"
,,
4,2," What?
"
,,
4,2," We'd egg his house.
"
,,
4,2," Come on. Where's this bastard live?
"
,,
4,2," I'll show you.
"
,,
4,2,"That's his house!
"
,,
4,2," Take that!
"
,,
4,2," I got it!
"
,,
4,2,"Take that, you bum!
"
,,
4,2,"What the hell are you doing?
"
,,
4,2," Is that him?
"
,,
4,2," Yeah!
"
,,
4,2,"Oh, crap!
"
,,
4,2,"Hello, class.
"
,,
4,2,"Mark Twain here, filling in for Brian Griffin.
"
,,
4,2,"I understand you children read my book,
"
,,
4,2,"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.
"
,,
4,2,"Yeah, we read it.
"
,,
4,2,"Now, who can tell me...
"
,,
4,2,"Bobby, stop screwing around back there!
"
,,
4,2,"Who can tell me the significance of
"
,,
4,2,"the carpetbaggers in my noveI?
"
,,
4,2,"Yeah. They stood for corruption and greed.
"
,,
4,2,"That's exactly right.
"
,,
4,2,"Just like the presidency of James Garfield.
"
,,
4,2,"He died in office.
"
,,
4,2,"You kids are mighty smart.
"
,,
4,2,"You must have a powerfuI good teacher.
"
,,
4,2,"Well, I gotta catch my time steamboat
"
,,
4,2,"back to the 1800s.
"
,,
4,2," Sorry I'm late. Did I miss anything?
"
,,
4,2," Yeah! Cap'n Crunch was here.
"
,,
4,2,"Didn't you pass him on the stairs?
"
,,
4,2,"Well, I hope the rest of you kids
"
,,
4,2,"learned something today.
"
,,
4,2,"Yeah.
"
,,
4,2,"Good morning,
"
,,
4,2,"this is PrincipaI Sloan.
"
,,
4,2,"Mr. Griffin, you've been reassigned.
"
,,
4,2,"Please report to RemediaI English.
"
,,
4,2,"Reassigned? Can I at least come down
"
,,
4,2,"to your office and talk to you about this?
"
,,
4,2,"No. I'm afraid I'm far too busy today.
"
,,
4,2,"Estoban, mucho tension lower.
"
,,
4,2,"Little lower. Lower.
"
,,
4,2,"Lower.
"
,,
4,2,"On top of
"
,,
4,2,"old Smokey
"
,,
4,2,"Gosh, I was really starting to like this job.
"
,,
4,2,"It was nice interacting with
"
,,
4,2,"intelligent people.
"
,,
4,2,"I usually hang out with an idiot.
"
,,
4,2,"Brian, check it out.
"
,,
4,2,"I made a water slide in the house.
"
,,
4,2,"I'm not gonna call the hospitaI
"
,,
4,2,"because you won't learn anything if I do.
"
,,
4,2,"Well, kids, I'll see you later.
"
,,
4,2,"Pardon me. Is this first-period English?
"
,,
4,2,"I'm your new teacher, Mrs. Lockhart.
"
,,
4,2,"Oh, my God. I'm in love.
"
,,
4,2,"Watch out for the stairs!
"
,,
4,2," Good morning, class.
"
,,
4,2," Good morning, Mrs. Lockhart.
"
,,
4,2,"I graded your quizzes from yesterday.
"
,,
4,2,"Most of you did well.
"
,,
4,2,"Some of you, I think, can do better.
"
,,
4,2,"What do you see here, Chris?
"
,,
4,2,"Two D's and an F.
"
,,
4,2,"Hi. I'm Mr. Griffin.
"
,,
4,2,"But you can call me Brian.
"
,,
4,2,"Mr. Griffin is my father.
"
,,
4,2,"Well, has anybody read Huckleberry Finn?
"
,,
4,2,"all right. How about we go around
"
,,
4,2,"the room and everyone can say...
"
,,
4,2,"a little something about themselves?
"
,,
4,2,"Let's start with you there in the front.
"
,,
4,2,"My name's Tim. I'm 28 years young.
"
,,
4,2,"And I love weed.
"
,,
4,2,"My name is Carlos. And beneath
"
,,
4,2,"my tough exterior is a boy aching to learn.
"
,,
4,2,"And beneath that is a rapist.
"
,,
4,2,"My name is Amanda.
"
,,
4,2,"And my water just broke.
"
,,
4,2," Oh, my God!
"
,,
4,2," Yo, it's my turn to deliver.
"
,,
4,2,"Can I have this one?
"
,,
4,2,"My mom keeps giving mine away.
"
,,
4,2,"Dad, I need some advice. I need to know
"
,,
4,2,"how to get a girI to like me.
"
,,
4,2,"Chris, buddy, there's a million ways
"
,,
4,2,"to do that.
"
,,
4,2,"You just got to do something simple,
"
,,
4,2,"like Vincent van Gogh.
"
,,
4,2,"It's... What is this?
"
,,
4,2,"It's my ear. Do you like it?
"
,,
4,2,"You don't like it.
"
,,
4,2,"No, I like it. But it's just... Why your ear?
"
,,
4,2,"Because I love you.
"
,,
4,2,"Well, at least this will be a funny story
"
,,
4,2,"to tell our kids someday.
"
,,
4,2,"You want kids? Oh, yikes.
"
,,
4,2,"I wish you'd told me that
"
,,
4,2,"before I got you this.
"
,,
4,2,"Did I hear my big boy say he's got
"
,,
4,2,"a crush on some lucky girI?
"
,,
4,2,"You know, Chris, I knew this day
"
,,
4,2,"would come. So, I brought you a condom.
"
,,
4,2,"Use it wisely, though.
"
,,
4,2,"It wasn't easy to obtain.
"
,,
4,2,"What the hell are you doing?
"
,,
4,2,"Give that back!
"
,,
4,2,"Man!
"
,,
4,2,"Now, where were we?
"
,,
4,2,"This is much better.
"
,,
4,2,"Chris, honey, the way to win a girI is
"
,,
4,2,"to do something romantic and unexpected.
"
,,
4,2,"Remember the naked spaceman, Lois?
"
,,
4,2,"Yeah. You remember the naked spaceman.
"
,,
4,2,"On my 25th birthday,
"
,,
4,2,"your father surprised me by showing up...
"
,,
4,2,"in nothing but a space helmet
"
,,
4,2,"and moon boots.
"
,,
4,2,"It just came to me.
"
,,
4,2," You want some Tang, Mr. Spaceman?
"
,,
4,2," Do I?
"
,,
4,2,"Just remember, fat man,
"
,,
4,2,"those jugs are mine untiI the milk dries up.
"
,,
4,2,"Then you can have the remains.
"
,,
4,2,"So, basically, what Orwell was saying
"
,,
4,2,"was, ""It's not perfect but I'll take it. ""
"
,,
4,2,"all right, moving on-
"
,,
4,2,"Sorry, I'm late, Mrs. Lockhart.
"
,,
4,2,"Oh, my God, Chris! What are you doing?
"
,,
4,2,"Being romantic and unexpected.
"
,,
4,2,"Chris, you can't be so impulsive.
"
,,
4,2,"People have gotten
"
,,
4,2,"into a lot of trouble that way.
"
,,
4,2," Marie?
"
,,
4,2," Yeah, Donny?
"
,,
4,2,"We cannot tell Mom.
"
,,
4,2,"So, Chris, what's the latest with
"
,,
4,2,"your little girlfriend?
"
,,
4,2,"I don't think Mrs. Lockhart likes me at all.
"
,,
4,2,"Mrs. Lockhart? Your teacher?
"
,,
4,2,"Whoa!
"
,,
4,2,"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
"
,,
4,2,"Lois, this is not my Batman glass.
"
,,
4,2,"Peter, are you listening?
"
,,
4,2,"Chris has a crush on his teacher.
"
,,
4,2,"Gross!
"
,,
4,2,"You know what else is gross?
"
,,
4,2,"Broke a damn blood vesseI!
"
,,
4,2,"How's it coming, dog?
"
,,
4,2,"God! Just listen to this kid's report
"
,,
4,2,"on Great Expectations.
"
,,
4,2,"""Miss Havisham should have throwed
"
,,
4,2,"that cake out so it don't like...
"
,,
4,2,"""mess all up the bitch's house. ""
"
,,
4,2,"I don't know what to do, you know?
"
,,
4,2,"Society's given up on these kids.
"
,,
4,2,"I feeI like I may be the only one
"
,,
4,2,"who can help them.
"
,,
4,2,"I think your problem is
"
,,
4,2,"you're not communicating in a way...
"
,,
4,2,"that speaks to their experience.
"
,,
4,2,"You know what you should do?
"
,,
4,2,"Get in there tomorrow and do the robot.
"
,,
4,2,"Wow. You know, you're right.
"
,,
4,2,"Maybe I should just try...
"
,,
4,2,"a whole new approach. Thanks.
"
,,
4,2,"Okay, you can stop that now.
"
,,
4,2,"I can't hear you. I'm a robot.
"
,,
4,2," Come on, knock it off.
"
,,
4,2," Does not compute.
"
,,
4,2," I'm going to bed.
"
,,
4,2," I do not require sleep.
"
,,
4,2,"Let's see the kid with the hearing aid
"
,,
4,2,"from Barney do this.
"
,,
4,2,"all right. So's I'm chilling in Verona
"
,,
4,2,"when my homie busts out with:
"
,,
4,2,"""Yo, Romeo. Check out
"
,,
4,2,"that biotch Juliet in the window. ""
"
,,
4,2,"Problem is, Juliet's peeps are, like,
"
,,
4,2,"East Coast rappers...
"
,,
4,2,"and my posse's representing West Side.
"
,,
4,2,"Just like my boys Tupac and Biggie.
"
,,
4,2,"Know what I'm saying?
"
,,
4,2," That's racist, man.
"
,,
4,2," Yeah, that's just straight ignorant, dog.
"
,,
4,2,"It's good to meet you, Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.
"
,,
4,2,"We wanted to talk to you about
"
,,
4,2,"our son. You see, Chris really-
"
,,
4,2,"Lois, honey, let's make sure
"
,,
4,2,"we do this delicately, all right?
"
,,
4,2,"Mrs. Lockhart, our son...
"
,,
4,2,"would like to plow you.
"
,,
4,2,"I had a feeling that's what was going on.
"
,,
4,2,"Sorry. Our son can sometimes be a boob.
"
,,
4,2,"I mean a melon.
"
,,
4,2,"I mean, a sopping-wet pair of breasts
"
,,
4,2,"barely covered by a racing t-shirt.
"
,,
4,2,"Mrs. Lockhart,
"
,,
4,2,"we just wanted you to know...
"
,,
4,2,"so you could spare his feelings
"
,,
4,2,"and let him down gently.
"
,,
4,2,"Don't worry.
"
,,
4,2,"I know exactly what to say to Chris.
"
,,
4,2,"Thank you so much.
"
,,
4,2,"You've been very understanding.
"
,,
4,2,"Gosh. You know, I don't mean to impose,
"
,,
4,2,"but do you have a picture of yourself...
"
,,
4,2,"that I could tape
"
,,
4,2,"to the back of Lois's head?
"
,,
4,2," Mrs. Lockhart?
"
,,
4,2," Chris, come down here.
"
,,
4,2,"I need to talk to you.
"
,,
4,2,"Why are you here?
"
,,
4,2,"'Cause I couldn't stand to be away
"
,,
4,2,"from you for another moment.
"
,,
4,2,"I think I'm falling in love with you.
"
,,
4,2," I love you, too!
"
,,
4,2," The only problem is I'm married.
"
,,
4,2,"Therefore, there's only one thing to do.
"
,,
4,2,"Make a flip book of a stick figure
"
,,
4,2,"whose head gets bigger and bigger...
"
,,
4,2,"and bigger and then pops?
"
,,
4,2,"This isn't a flip book, Chris.
"
,,
4,2,"They're instructions.
"
,,
4,2,"If we're going to be together,
"
,,
4,2,"I need you to kill my husband.
"
,,
4,2,"Do you have any idea what time it is?
"
,,
4,2,"Get in the house, fatty!
"
,,
4,2,"Chris, you big beautifuI man,
"
,,
4,2,"I'm so glad you came.
"
,,
4,2,"Up the stairs, second door on the left.
"
,,
4,2,"He should still be asleep.
"
,,
4,2," Mrs. Lockhart, I don't think I can do this.
"
,,
4,2," What?
"
,,
4,2,"Maybe you could just get a divorce,
"
,,
4,2,"and we could live together...
"
,,
4,2,"in the fort under my bed.
"
,,
4,2,"Fine. I'll do it myself. But we're through.
"
,,
4,2,"Okay. But I got to give you the password,
"
,,
4,2,"or you can't get into the fort.
"
,,
4,2,"It's taco. Taco!
"
,,
4,2,"Good God!
"
,,
4,2,"Look at the fat man's underwear.
"
,,
4,2,"It looks like a Jackson Pollock painting.
"
,,
4,2,"Don't put that in with my things!
"
,,
4,2,"What's this?
"
,,
4,2,"You know, Stewie, Mommy doesn't
"
,,
4,2,"usually read things out of Chris's pockets.
"
,,
4,2,"She's more respectfuI than that.
"
,,
4,2,"Yeah, whatever helps you
"
,,
4,2,"sleep at night, bitch.
"
,,
4,2,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
4,2,"Chris is gonna murder
"
,,
4,2,"Mrs. Lockhart's husband!
"
,,
4,2,"We got to stop him!
"
,,
4,2,"Can we stop at the supermarket?
"
,,
4,2,"I want a Granny Smith apple.
"
,,
4,2,"How's your oatmeaI, honey?
"
,,
4,2,"You know,
"
,,
4,2,"it tastes kind of different than usuaI.
"
,,
4,2,"Oh, my God! There's a bear in my oatmeaI.
"
,,
4,2,"Yeah, I know. I'm late.
"
,,
4,2,"Okay, let's just get started.
"
,,
4,2,"Yo, man, what's that thing in the middle?
"
,,
4,2,"What, this?
"
,,
4,2,"You got to be freaking kidding me.
"
,,
4,2,"That's an ampersand.
"
,,
4,2,"It's a symboI for the word ""and. ""
"
,,
4,2,"My God, nobody can be this stupid.
"
,,
4,2,"Not even Peter when he took...
"
,,
4,2,"that blow to the head and thought he was
"
,,
4,2,"Larry from Three's Company.
"
,,
4,2,"Jack, there's a hot tub party
"
,,
4,2,"across the street and we're invited.
"
,,
4,2,"And don't worry. If Mr. Furley comes by,
"
,,
4,2,"I'll make sure he thinks you're...
"
,,
4,2,"Mr. Griffin, chillax.
"
,,
4,2,"We're doing the best we can.
"
,,
4,2,"There is nothing I would like to do
"
,,
4,2,"more than chillax, Amanda.
"
,,
4,2,"But without a decent education,
"
,,
4,2,"you could spend the rest of your life...
"
,,
4,2,"as a ditch digger or a moteI maid
"
,,
4,2,"or a hooker.
"
,,
4,2," I could be a ditch digger?
"
,,
4,2," A moteI maid?
"
,,
4,2,"I could be a hooker?
"
,,
4,2,"Well, no. You don't want to be a hooker.
"
,,
4,2,"Wow, Mr. Griffin! You're the first teacher
"
,,
4,2,"that ever told us we could do anything.
"
,,
4,2,"Well, I didn't mean sell your body
"
,,
4,2,"for money.
"
,,
4,2,"""O, Captain! my Captain! ""
"
,,
4,2,"No, you're actually misunderstanding.
"
,,
4,2,"""O, Captain! my Captain! ""
"
,,
4,2,"Well, if it works for you, I guess...
"
,,
4,2,"""O, Captain! my Captain! ""
"
,,
4,2,"What the hell?
"
,,
4,2,"Be the best damn hooker you can be.
"
,,
4,2,"""O, Captain! my Captain! ""
"
,,
4,2,"In your case, I'd get the money up front.
"
,,
4,2,"Jack, twins! Swedish. My place. Now.
"
,,
4,2,"We're too late! Oh, my God.
"
,,
4,2,"Okay, I gotta call the police.
"
,,
4,2,"What's that smell?
"
,,
4,2,"Dead body, right. That's what that is.
"
,,
4,2,"I just had a dream I was an egg, and I was
"
,,
4,2,"being hatched by Elisabeth Hasselbeck.
"
,,
4,2,"No, wait a minute. I can't call the police.
"
,,
4,2,"I have to get rid of this body,
"
,,
4,2,"or Chris'll go to prison!
"
,,
4,2,"And we all know what happens in those
"
,,
4,2,"prison showers. I've seen Oz.
"
,,
4,2,"Scrub scrub here,
"
,,
4,2,"scrub scrub there
"
,,
4,2,"Whether you're white or bronze
"
,,
4,2,"A man can wash another man
"
,,
4,2,"in the merry old land of Oz
"
,,
4,2,"all right, wait here, Stewie,
"
,,
4,2,"while Mommy gets the cement blocks.
"
,,
4,2," Everything all right here?
"
,,
4,2," Fine, Officer. Just enjoying the sunset.
"
,,
4,2,"No law against that, is there?
"
,,
4,2," What happened to your shirt?
"
,,
4,2," You know, just a pizza party at the office.
"
,,
4,2,"Yeah? Where do you work?
"
,,
4,2,"First Fidelity Insurance
"
,,
4,2,"over on Wabossette Street.
"
,,
4,2," My cousin, Arnie, works over there.
"
,,
4,2," Arnie's your cousin, is he?
"
,,
4,2," You know him?
"
,,
4,2," Somewhat.
"
,,
4,2,"Good middle-management type.
"
,,
4,2,"Just blends in with the furniture there.
"
,,
4,2,"Never really wowed anyone at the office.
"
,,
4,2,"Yeah, that's always been Arnie's problem.
"
,,
4,2,"Well, take it easy.
"
,,
4,2,"Yes. You, too.
"
,,
4,2,"And if you see Arnie, tell him:
"
,,
4,2,"He'll know what it means.
"
,,
4,2,"You know what I hate?
"
,,
4,2,"A guy in a blue suit.
"
,,
4,2,"There's one right behind me, isn't there?
"
,,
4,2,"You know, Lois, Chris is cooI and
"
,,
4,2,"everything, but since he killed that guy...
"
,,
4,2,"I don't know. Maybe he shouldn't be
"
,,
4,2,"living with us here now.
"
,,
4,2,"Peter, I'm scared.
"
,,
4,2,"Don't worry, sweetheart.
"
,,
4,2,"You'll have plenty of time to escape...
"
,,
4,2,"while he's killing Meg.
"
,,
4,2,"He hates her the most.
"
,,
4,2,"Hey, everybody. What's for dinner?
"
,,
4,2,"I'm starving.
"
,,
4,2,"My God, his blood lust is unquenchable!
"
,,
4,2,"Chris, why don't you take your sister
"
,,
4,2,"into the kitchen for a sandwich?
"
,,
4,2,"I don't want to die!
"
,,
4,2,"Why is everybody acting weird?
"
,,
4,2,"Chris, honey, we know what you did.
"
,,
4,2,"And I have to say,
"
,,
4,2,"honestly, I don't approve.
"
,,
4,2,"What I did? That I lied about my age
"
,,
4,2,"to get into Indian Bingo?
"
,,
4,2,"No.
"
,,
4,2,"That I had hard gas and pooed myself?
"
,,
4,2,"Close, but still no.
"
,,
4,2,"How is that close?
"
,,
4,2,"For God's sake, Chris!
"
,,
4,2,"You murdered Mr. Lockhart!
"
,,
4,2,"What? No, I didn't!
"
,,
4,2,"Come on. Everybody's done
"
,,
4,2,"something they're not proud of.
"
,,
4,2,"Like when I used to be a Wonder Twin.
"
,,
4,2,"Peter, the old schoolhouse is on fire!
"
,,
4,2,"Let's go!
"
,,
4,2,"Wonder Twin powers, activate!
"
,,
4,2,"Form of a hawk!
"
,,
4,2," Come on, Peter.
"
,,
4,2," Yeah, I'll be right behind you.
"
,,
4,2,"Shape of Jayna's tampon.
"
,,
4,2,"And now I play the waiting game.
"
,,
4,2,"Chris, I saw the body.
"
,,
4,2,"Premeditated murder is one thing,
"
,,
4,2,"but I will not have Iying in this house.
"
,,
4,2,"Wait, hold it.
"
,,
4,2,"Can we finish this after Joan of Arcadia?
"
,,
4,2,"Is Joan of Arcadia on?
"
,,
4,2,"all right.
"
,,
4,2,"Must be good.
"
,,
4,2,"Enjoyable program.
"
,,
4,2,"We interrupt this broadcast
"
,,
4,2,"to bring you a breaking news story.
"
,,
4,2,"We apologize to Joan of Arcadia's
"
,,
4,2,"sanctimonious, fear-based...
"
,,
4,2,"and probably overweight viewers.
"
,,
4,2,"That's right, Diane.
"
,,
4,2,"It appears Ronald Lockhart...
"
,,
4,2,"has been brutally murdered by his wife,
"
,,
4,2,"Lana, and a locaI bear.
"
,,
4,2,"Well, I'll be damned.
"
,,
4,2,"Chris, I guess we owe you an apology.
"
,,
4,2,"That's okay. I just wonder what happened
"
,,
4,2,"to Ms. Lockhart and that bear.
"
,,
4,2,"The whereabouts of these suspects
"
,,
4,2,"are currently unknown.
"
,,
4,2," You ready?
"
,,
4,2," What's that?
"
,,
4,2,"I thought we'd try that lobster place
"
,,
4,2,"we passed in the car.
"
,,
4,2," Yeah, can I just finish watching this?
"
,,
4,2," You can watch TV anytime. I'm starving.
"
,,
4,2,"Lana, this is gonna be a reaI long trip
"
,,
4,2,"if you don't knock off the crap!
"
,,
4,2,"Love you.
"
,,
4,3,"[Singing] <i>It seems today that all you see</i>
"
,,
4,3,"I must say
"
,,
4,3,"I do feel a strange satisfaction...
"
,,
4,3,"watching the black ball topple
"
,,
4,3,"all those self-righteous white pins.
"
,,
4,3,"Can't blame them for being self-righteous.
"
,,
4,3,"The black ball's
"
,,
4,3,"in their neighborhood uninvited.
"
,,
4,3,"The black ball's done nothing wrong.
"
,,
4,3,"If the black ball's innocent,
"
,,
4,3,"it has nothing to fear.
"
,,
4,3,"Wonder what the hell's down there.
"
,,
4,3,"Judd Hirsch?
"
,,
4,3,"Hey.
"
,,
4,3,"What's going on?
"
,,
4,3,"Nothing.
"
,,
4,3,"All right.
"
,,
4,3,"Hi, boys. Your ride is here.
"
,,
4,3,"Hey, you're just in time.
"
,,
4,3,"Mort's one ball away from a perfect game.
"
,,
4,3,"Oh, God. The pressure's too much.
"
,,
4,3,"I just lost control of my bladder.
"
,,
4,3,"Why didn't I clothespin the end
"
,,
4,3,"of my penis like Muriel told me to?
"
,,
4,3,"Oh, my God. You bowled a perfect game.
"
,,
4,3,"I just never stopped believing.
"
,,
4,3,"Say no to acid.
"
,,
4,3,"Jeez, relax, Mort.
"
,,
4,3,"You'd think you were God himself.
"
,,
4,3,"No, he's over there.
"
,,
4,3,"Hey, you want to see what I can do?
"
,,
4,3,"All right, ready? Check it out.
"
,,
4,3,"Beer, glass. All right, now watch this.
"
,,
4,3,"Oh, hey.
"
,,
4,3,"Guess I'll go over here for a minute.
"
,,
4,3,"Oh, holy crap!
"
,,
4,3,"That's still pouring itself. Oh, wow.
"
,,
4,3,"That's amazing.
"
,,
4,3,"I've never seen anyone do that.
"
,,
4,3,"You want to go out later?
"
,,
4,3,"I'll be right back. I'm gonna go tinkle.
"
,,
4,3,"Okay, everybody ready?
"
,,
4,3,"Hey, where's Quagmire?
"
,,
4,3,"[Sighs]
"
,,
4,3,"[Quagmire grunting]
"
,,
4,3,"[Quagmire grunting]
"
,,
4,3,"[Quagmire groaning]
"
,,
4,3,"QUAGMIRE: Would you just sit down
"
,,
4,3,"and go to the bathroom already?
"
,,
4,3,"He's all yours, Joe.
"
,,
4,3,"You're lucky I've got some extra pull
"
,,
4,3,"around here...
"
,,
4,3,"thanks to my 18 medals for heroism.
"
,,
4,3,"There he goes again with the medals.
"
,,
4,3,"Hey, Joe, if you love your medals so much,
"
,,
4,3,"why don't you marry them?
"
,,
4,3,"I did something like that once.
"
,,
4,3,"And in the event of your death...
"
,,
4,3,"you'd like the insurance policy
"
,,
4,3,"to be paid to your wife?
"
,,
4,3,"Yup.
"
,,
4,3,"And your wife is this piece of pie?
"
,,
4,3,"You got it. Love you.
"
,,
4,3,"Okay, sign here.
"
,,
4,3,"You know what? You can probably
"
,,
4,3,"go ahead and cancel that.
"
,,
4,3,"Well, well, look who's here.
"
,,
4,3,"All right, all right,
"
,,
4,3,"look, I know an apology is due here...
"
,,
4,3,"so, Lois, tell Quagmire
"
,,
4,3,"you're sorry you had him arrested.
"
,,
4,3,"Excuse me?
"
,,
4,3,"He's the one who owes me an apology.
"
,,
4,3,"He was watching me go to the bathroom.
"
,,
4,3,"Well, clearly he thinks you're attractive,
"
,,
4,3,"Lois. It's a positive thing.
"
,,
4,3,"Thank you, Glenn,
"
,,
4,3,"for complimenting our family.
"
,,
4,3,"We have had it
"
,,
4,3,"with his disrespect for women.
"
,,
4,3,"We're petitioning the city to have him
"
,,
4,3,"removed from the neighborhood.
"
,,
4,3,"Yeah, I don't want to bring a new baby
"
,,
4,3,"into the world with him running around.
"
,,
4,3,"First of all, Bonnie, you've been pregnant
"
,,
4,3,"for six years, all right?
"
,,
4,3,"Either have the baby or don't.
"
,,
4,3,"Second of all, Quagmire's a good guy.
"
,,
4,3,"He's just a little mixed up.
"
,,
4,3,"[Car tires screeching]
"
,,
4,3,"[Train horn blaring]
"
,,
4,3," This isn't medium rare.
"
,,
4,3," Then have them take it back.
"
,,
4,3,"[Peter panting]
"
,,
4,3,"Sorry about that.
"
,,
4,3,"Second of all, Quagmire's a good guy,
"
,,
4,3,"you know? He's just a little mixed up.
"
,,
4,3,"That's all. Come on.
"
,,
4,3,"Give him another chance, eh?
"
,,
4,3,"All right. But one more incident
"
,,
4,3,"like the one at the bowling alley...
"
,,
4,3,"and Quagmire is out of this neighborhood.
"
,,
4,3,"Now, don't worry about a thing, Quagmire.
"
,,
4,3,"Your pals are gonna
"
,,
4,3,"help you change your ways.
"
,,
4,3,"I don't know, Peter.
"
,,
4,3,"I'm not sure I can do this.
"
,,
4,3,"QUAGMIRE: Meg, get out of the way.
"
,,
4,3,"All right, Glenn. This exercise
"
,,
4,3,"should help teach you self-control.
"
,,
4,3,"Here's this month's
"
,,
4,3,"Oh, God. Oh, God.
"
,,
4,3,"Dead kittens. Dead kittens.
"
,,
4,3,"Old nuns. Really old nuns.
"
,,
4,3,"Renee Zellweger. Oh, there we go.
"
,,
4,3," All right.
"
,,
4,3," You did good. Good.
"
,,
4,3,"Peter, are you sure
"
,,
4,3,"Quagmire is ready to be out in public?
"
,,
4,3,"Nothing to worry about, Lois.
"
,,
4,3,"We figured out
"
,,
4,3,"a foolproof rehabilitation method.
"
,,
4,3,"I got the idea from when Brian
"
,,
4,3,"had to wear that cone after his operation.
"
,,
4,3,"Okay, if I make this,
"
,,
4,3,"we're all gonna get laid.
"
,,
4,3,"Yes! Score! Score!
"
,,
4,3,"BRIAN: Boy, I'd really like to
"
,,
4,3,"chew on my crotch right now.
"
,,
4,3,"Okay, Quagmire.
"
,,
4,3,"Time to take off your training wheels.
"
,,
4,3,"Okay, I think I'm ready.
"
,,
4,3,"[AII chattering]
"
,,
4,3,"Oh, boy.
"
,,
4,3," What's the matter, Glenn?
"
,,
4,3," Nothing.
"
,,
4,3,"Oh, Stacie, you dropped
"
,,
4,3,"your pompom in the water.
"
,,
4,3," I'll get it for you.
"
,,
4,3," I'll come with you.
"
,,
4,3," Me, too.
"
,,
4,3," But wait a minute.
"
,,
4,3,"We don't want to get our sweaters all wet.
"
,,
4,3,"Better take them off.
"
,,
4,3,"Splash fight!
"
,,
4,3,"[AII laughing]
"
,,
4,3,"Oh, God. Oh, God. I need some air.
"
,,
4,3,"Naked plastic chicks.
"
,,
4,3,"[Screams]
"
,,
4,3," Where am I? Am I dead?
"
,,
4,3," No.
"
,,
4,3,"This is where we monitor
"
,,
4,3,"all the dressing rooms in the mall...
"
,,
4,3,"so we can keep an eye out for shoplifters.
"
,,
4,3,"You don't say.
"
,,
4,3,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
4,3,"That one's having a heart attack!
"
,,
4,3,"[Woman coughing]
"
,,
4,3," That was amazing.
"
,,
4,3," You saved her life.
"
,,
4,3,"Thank God you know CPR.
"
,,
4,3,"What the hell's CPR?
"
,,
4,3,"Congratulations, Quagmire.
"
,,
4,3,"You're the newest member
"
,,
4,3,"of my wall of fame.
"
,,
4,3,"What's wrong, Peter?
"
,,
4,3,"It's nothing, Joe. I don't know.
"
,,
4,3,"It's just that all you guys
"
,,
4,3,"have something to be proud of.
"
,,
4,3,"PETER: Quagmire got a key to the city.
"
,,
4,3,"Mort bowled a perfect game.
"
,,
4,3,"You're always getting medals
"
,,
4,3,"for catching crooks.
"
,,
4,3,"Hell, even Cleveland
"
,,
4,3,"used to be an accomplished auctioneer.
"
,,
4,3,"I have 125. Do I hear 130? $130,000
"
,,
4,3,"for this authentic Comanche headdress?
"
,,
4,3,"I got 130. Do I hear 135? 140? Do I hear...
"
,,
4,3,"I'm the only one here
"
,,
4,3,"who's got nothing, you know?
"
,,
4,3,"If I die tomorrow, there's nothing
"
,,
4,3,"people would remember me for.
"
,,
4,3,"Not if you jumped off a skyscraper
"
,,
4,3,"and landed on Joan Cusack.
"
,,
4,3,"People would say, ""Hey, remember
"
,,
4,3,"that guy who landed on Joan Cusack?""
"
,,
4,3,"Well, things are gonna change.
"
,,
4,3,"From this day forth, people are gonna
"
,,
4,3,"know the name Peter Griffin...
"
,,
4,3,"even if I have to shout it
"
,,
4,3,"from the rooftops.
"
,,
4,3,"You hear that, world?
"
,,
4,3,"I am gonna do something
"
,,
4,3,"that people will remember me for.
"
,,
4,3,"[Thudding]
"
,,
4,3,"Oh, God! Sorry, sorry. Hey, Joan Cusack.
"
,,
4,3,"Hello?
"
,,
4,3,"Oh-oh.
"
,,
4,3,"Peter, if you'd just let me talk, I'll explain
"
,,
4,3,"to you why you shouldn't do this.
"
,,
4,3,"Later, Brian. I gotta do something
"
,,
4,3,"people will remember me for...
"
,,
4,3,"which is why I've invented
"
,,
4,3,"a new type of flying machine.
"
,,
4,3,"You know, I vaguely recall
"
,,
4,3,"seeing footage somewhere...
"
,,
4,3,"of something exactly like this that leads
"
,,
4,3,"me to believe this probably won't work.
"
,,
4,3,"All right, Stewie. Let her rip.
"
,,
4,3,"All right...
"
,,
4,3,"we attack the Rice Krispie guys at dawn,
"
,,
4,3,"assuming Judd Hirsch delivers the goods.
"
,,
4,3,"Brian, this time, I think I got just the thing
"
,,
4,3,"people will remember me for.
"
,,
4,3,"I am gonna stop pollution
"
,,
4,3,"with my new lovable character...
"
,,
4,3,"Gary the No-Trash Cougar.
"
,,
4,3,"Pick up your trash!
"
,,
4,3,"I want to know whose cup this is.
"
,,
4,3,"I said I want to know whose cup this is!
"
,,
4,3,"Pick it up!
"
,,
4,3,"Thank you, sweetie.
"
,,
4,3,"See what a nicer place this is
"
,,
4,3,"when we all pitch in?
"
,,
4,3,"Like Gary the No-Trash Cougar says:
"
,,
4,3,"""Give a larbage, throw out your garbage.""
"
,,
4,3,"Spread the word.
"
,,
4,3,"Those freaking elves, man.
"
,,
4,3,"They just came out of the trees, man.
"
,,
4,3," They just came out of the trees.
"
,,
4,3," You saved my ass back there.
"
,,
4,3,"You saved mine.
"
,,
4,3," Here's to Snap.
"
,,
4,3," To Snap.
"
,,
4,3,"This sucks.
"
,,
4,3,"I've been working on this all week
"
,,
4,3,"and I keep coming up dry.
"
,,
4,3,"Who am I kidding? I'm never gonna
"
,,
4,3,"be remembered for anything.
"
,,
4,3,"Not like my great-great-uncles,
"
,,
4,3,"the Siamese twins...
"
,,
4,3,"who fought each other in the Civil War.
"
,,
4,3," I'm seceding.
"
,,
4,3," Like hell you are.
"
,,
4,3,"Not too smart, huh?
"
,,
4,3,"Yeah, did not think that one through.
"
,,
4,3,"Peter, you have to stop
"
,,
4,3,"comparing yourself to other people...
"
,,
4,3,"and find out what's special about you.
"
,,
4,3,"There you go, Peter.
"
,,
4,3,"You could break a world record.
"
,,
4,3,"What, are you nuts?
"
,,
4,3,"I got no special talents.
"
,,
4,3,"What can I do that nobody else does?
"
,,
4,3,"Well, you just ate my tip.
"
,,
4,3,"I got it!
"
,,
4,3,"Peter, you're really putting away
"
,,
4,3,"those Mentos.
"
,,
4,3,"These aren't Mentos, Lois.
"
,,
4,3,"Everybody, you're looking at a guy
"
,,
4,3,"who's gonna set a new world record.
"
,,
4,3,"I am gonna eat more nickels
"
,,
4,3,"than anyone has ever eaten before.
"
,,
4,3,"Setting this world record
"
,,
4,3,"is gonna make me famous...
"
,,
4,3,"just like the world's fattest twins
"
,,
4,3,"over there.
"
,,
4,3," Did I tell you that I'm doing Atkins?
"
,,
4,3," Oh, that's not good for you.
"
,,
4,3,"[Coins jingling]
"
,,
4,3," Dad, I just don't hear it.
"
,,
4,3," Come on!
"
,,
4,3,"Really, Peter. It just doesn't...
"
,,
4,3,"You're telling me that doesn't sound
"
,,
4,3,"like <i>Camptown Races?</i>
"
,,
4,3,"Not one bit.
"
,,
4,3,"Do <i>Short People!</i>
"
,,
4,3,"This is the worst use of money
"
,,
4,3,"since I tricked out my big wheel.
"
,,
4,3,"Hey, ladies, check out this ride. Yeah.
"
,,
4,3,"I'm off to make trouble
"
,,
4,3,"for the establishment.
"
,,
4,3,"PETER: I love you, Lois.
"
,,
4,3,"LOIS: I love you, too, Peter.
"
,,
4,3,"Even if you are full of nickels.
"
,,
4,3,"[Coins jingling rhythmically]
"
,,
4,3,"[Jingling intensifies]
"
,,
4,3,"PETER: Goodnight, honey.
"
,,
4,3,"[Alarm beeping]
"
,,
4,3,"Oh, my God, Lois. I can't see.
"
,,
4,3,"DOCTOR: How about now?
"
,,
4,3,"PETER: No, nothing.
"
,,
4,3,"DOCTOR: Well, that makes me feel
"
,,
4,3,"much better.
"
,,
4,3,"You can't see the spaceship, either.
"
,,
4,3,"My cousin Marshall insists
"
,,
4,3,"if you look past the picture...
"
,,
4,3,"you can see a spaceship.
"
,,
4,3,"Can you please just tell us
"
,,
4,3,"what's wrong with my husband?
"
,,
4,3,"Oh, yes. You see, after ingesting
"
,,
4,3,"such a large number of metal coins...
"
,,
4,3,"Mr. Griffin appears to have succumbed
"
,,
4,3,"to nickel poisoning...
"
,,
4,3,"causing him to lose his sight.
"
,,
4,3,"Oh, my God, Lois. I'm blind as a bat.
"
,,
4,3,"I can't see a damn thing.
"
,,
4,3,"You know what else you can't see?
"
,,
4,3,"The writing on the wall.
"
,,
4,3,"Vaudeville's dead. And TV's the box
"
,,
4,3,"they're gonna bury it in.
"
,,
4,3,"Back then, everybody had a specialty.
"
,,
4,3,"I, for one, am a tumbler.
"

"

4,3,"So we're all gonna have to pitch in
"
,,
4,3,"and help your father out...
"
,,
4,3,"now that he's lost his sight.
"
,,
4,3,"Nobody took care of me
"
,,
4,3,"when I lost my arms and legs...
"
,,
4,3,"and was struck blind, deaf, and dumb.
"
,,
4,3,"Hey, Meg,
"
,,
4,3,"they got a <i>Happy Days</i> spoof in here...
"
,,
4,3,"but they call it <i>Crappy Days.</i>
"
,,
4,3,"All right, you know what?
"
,,
4,3,"If you're not gonna laugh,
"
,,
4,3,"then I'm not gonna keep you company.
"
,,
4,3,"This sucks. Now the only thing anybody's
"
,,
4,3,"gonna remember me for after I die...
"
,,
4,3,"is being that blind guy.
"
,,
4,3,"Don't give up yet, Peter.
"
,,
4,3,"I mean,
"
,,
4,3,"many blind people live rich, fulfilling lives.
"
,,
4,3,"I don't know, Brian.
"
,,
4,3,"I mean, I guess I can give it a shot.
"
,,
4,3,"Oh, my God, I almost didn't do it.
"
,,
4,3,"I almost didn't do it.
"
,,
4,3,"I thought, ""Is this in bad taste?""
"
,,
4,3,"But you know what? I went for it.
"
,,
4,3,"I went for it and I am so glad I did.
"
,,
4,3,"Oh, worth it. Totally worth it.
"
,,
4,3," Hey, you still awake, Lois, honey?
"
,,
4,3," Dad?
"
,,
4,3,"That's right. I'm your daddy.
"
,,
4,3,"Don't talk, Lois. Don't talk.
"
,,
4,3,"Just let me do all the work. Yeah.
"
,,
4,3,"Now feel my warm breath
"
,,
4,3,"on the nape of your neck.
"
,,
4,3,"My hands on your big soft boobs
"
,,
4,3,"running down your big manlike...

4,3,"Holy crap, it's Chris.
"
,,
4,3,"So, how're you doing?
"
,,
4,3,"You do all your homework?
"
,,
4,3,"Finish all your subjects?
"
,,
4,3," Yes, sir.
"
,,
4,3," Good.
"
,,
4,3,"Just checking. Have a good night, Son.
"
,,
4,3,"PETER: You still awake, honey?
"
,,
4,3,"STEWIE: What the deuce?
"
,,
4,3," Peter, what the hell is that?
"
,,
4,3," This is my Seeing Eye dog, Brutus.
"
,,
4,3,"What do you need a Seeing Eye dog for?
"
,,
4,3,"Well, because I can't do anything
"
,,
4,3,"for myself, Brian. I can't drive.
"
,,
4,3,"I don't know when to cross the street.
"
,,
4,3,"And I took a dump
"
,,
4,3,"in the church confessional...
"
,,
4,3,"which I guess they frown upon
"
,,
4,3,"if you're not homeless.
"
,,
4,3,"I thought I could deal with being blind
"
,,
4,3,"at first.
"
,,
4,3,"But I don't know.
"
,,
4,3,"I haven't felt this out of place
"
,,
4,3,"since that week I lived with Superman.
"
,,
4,3,"We must stop Lex Luthor before
"
,,
4,3,"he irradiates the world's supply of gold.
"
,,
4,3,"Hi, sorry.
"
,,
4,3,"I know you got a meeting going on. But...
"
,,
4,3,"So we are officially running low
"
,,
4,3,"on Mr. Pibb and Cheez-Its.
"
,,
4,3,"So just putting it out there.
"
,,
4,3,"If you're heading to the store later...
"
,,
4,3,"you know, 800-mile drive for me,
"
,,
4,3,"like, five seconds for you.
"
,,
4,3,"Whatever. I'm not here.
"
,,
4,3,"Peter, this is something
"
,,
4,3,"you're still adjusting to.
"
,,
4,3,"You can't expect
"
,,
4,3,"to get used to it overnight.
"
,,
4,3,"Whatever you say, Brian.
"
,,
4,3,"I'm going to The Clam.
"
,,
4,3,"Did Peter leave?
"
,,
4,3,"Yeah. Boy, he's really down about this.
"
,,
4,3,"I know. I'm so worried about him.
"
,,
4,3,"I've been looking into support groups
"
,,
4,3,"we could join to help him.
"
,,
4,3," Are you not wearing makeup?
"
,,
4,3," No, I just...
"
,,
4,3,"You know, since Peter went blind...
"
,,
4,3,"it's actually been kind of nice not to
"
,,
4,3,"have to worry about my appearance.
"
,,
4,3,"I see.
"
,,
4,3,"Is it really noticeable?
"
,,
4,3,"Well, a little mascara wouldn't kill you.
"
,,
4,3,"I was kind of thinking I'd try
"
,,
4,3,"an au naturel thing.
"
,,
4,3,"You think you have the skin for that?
"
,,
4,3,"Oh, let me light that for you, babe.
"
,,
4,3," Wow!
"
,,
4,3," Yeah, magic fingers.
"
,,
4,3," Jesus Christ!
"
,,
4,3," What?
"
,,
4,3,"Get the Escalade. We're out of here.

,,

"
,,
4,3,"[Brutus whimpering]
"
,,
4,3,"Come on, girl. I'm thirsty.
"
,,
4,3,"All right, you don't want to come in? Fine.
"
,,
4,3,"I'll just tie you to this parking meter.
"
,,
4,3,"Hey, Horace.
"
,,
4,3,"I'll have a Pawtucket Patriot.
"
,,
4,3,"So how's your hammer hanging?
"
,,
4,3,"[Peter sniffing]
"
,,
4,3,"Is somebody smoking in here?
"
,,
4,3,"Hey, you ever watch that show <i>Scrubs?</i>
"
,,
4,3,"Lois had it on the other night
"
,,
4,3,"and I was kind of fading in and out.
"
,,
4,3,"But, you know, I was watching and I'm
"
,,
4,3,"wondering, which one is the funny guy?
"
,,
4,3,"Peter, grab my hand!
"
,,
4,3," Jeez, Horace, you been drinking?
"
,,
4,3," Grab it and pull!
"
,,
4,3,"Come on, let's go.
"
,,
4,3,"And here comes the heroic blind man.
"
,,
4,3,"Tell us, sir, how did you summon
"
,,
4,3,"the courage to save your friend...
"
,,
4,3," from that burning building?
"
,,
4,3," That freaking place was on fire?
"
,,
4,3,"And there you have it.
"
,,
4,3,"Coming up next, watch me shave.
"
,,
4,3,"Peter, you're all right!
"
,,
4,3,"I am so proud of you
"
,,
4,3,"for saving Horace's life.
"
,,
4,3,"Yeah, Peter, you were amazing.
"
,,
4,3,"You know, Brian, I guess I was.
"
,,
4,3,"And you know what else?
"
,,
4,3,"People are gonna remember me for this.

,,
4,4,"Oh, my God, he is so gorgeous.
"
,,
4,4,"And he plays by no one's rules
"
,,
4,4,"but his own.
"
,,
4,4,"Meg, you should ask him out.
"
,,
4,4,"I mean, you're the only one of us
"
,,
4,4,"who's ever had a real boyfriend.
"
,,
4,4,"I'm back. I brought another picnic.
"
,,
4,4,"You're such a good listener.
"
,,
4,4,"You're not like the other boys.
"
,,
4,4,"You're so good with animals.
"
,,
4,4,"I guess I could give it a try.
"
,,
4,4,"All right, here goes.
"
,,
4,4,"Hi, Craig.
"
,,
4,4,"I was wondering if maybe you'd want to...
"
,,
4,4,"I don't know, go out sometime.
"
,,
4,4,"That's about as likely as me playing
"
,,
4,4,"by someone else's rules besides my own...
"
,,
4,4,"which I would never do.
"
,,
4,4,"I play by my own rules, nobody else's.
"
,,
4,4,"Not even my own.
"
,,
4,4," How about a movie?
"
,,
4,4," I don't go out with dudes.
"
,,
4,4," Mom, Dad, am I ugly?
"
,,
4,4," Of course not, sweetie.
"
,,
4,4,"Yeah, where'd you get
"
,,
4,4,"a stupid idea like that?
"
,,
4,4," Craig Hoffman.
"
,,
4,4," Craig Hoffman said that?
"
,,
4,4,"Well, he's a sharp kid. You might be ugly.
"
,,
4,4,"There, there, let me dry those tears.
"
,,
4,4,"Yes, your anguish sustains me.
"
,,
4,4,"Meg, honey, don't let
"
,,
4,4,"those awful kids at school...
"
,,
4,4,"make you feel bad about yourself.
"
,,
4,4,"I tell you what.
"
,,
4,4,"Tomorrow you and I are gonna go out
"
,,
4,4,"and get you some brand new outfits.
"
,,
4,4,"Maybe a pair of those low-rider jeans
"
,,
4,4,"that'll show off your cute butt, huh?
"
,,
4,4,"Really? Wow, thanks, Mom.
"
,,
4,4,"Meg in low-riders.

4,4,"Enough of that.

4,4,"Go away, damn you.
"
,,
4,4,"You're going to get it now.

,,

,,
4,4,"Horace, what is this all about?
"
,,
4,4,"What the hell's it look like?

,,
4,4,"I'm putting the bar up for sale.
"
,,
4,4,"Please tell me
"
,,
4,4,"this is some kind of practical joke.
"
,,
4,4,"Like the kind I used to play when
"
,,
4,4,"I was an intern at the hospital.

,,
4,4,"I'm afraid I have some very bad news.

,,
4,4,"Your wife's gonna be a vegetable.

,,
4,4,"You'll have to bathe her, feed her
"
,,
4,4,"and care for her the rest of her life.
"
,,
4,4,"Oh, my God.
"
,,
4,4,"No, I'm just kidding. She's dead.
"
,,
4,4,"Ever since that mega-mall opened
"
,,
4,4,"across the street...
"
,,
4,4,"it's been taking away all my business.
"
,,
4,4,"They got 300 stores, 200 restaurants...
"
,,
4,4,"[Effeminately] I go to Baskin-Robbins
"

4,4,"A pink baby tee that says ""Little Slut?""
"

4,4," That seems pretty hip.
"

,,
4,4,"Give me ""Sperm Dumpster.""

4,4,"That's the spirit.
"

"
,,
4,4," Yes, thank you.
"

4,4,"Oh, my God, we don't know any songs.
"
,,
4,4," You suck!
"
,,
4,4," Get off the stage!
"
,,
4,4,"What do we do?
"
,,
4,4,"I know what I'm doing.
"
,,
4,4,"I'm getting out of here.
"
,,
4,4,"How about a funny story
"
,,
4,4,"about Lake Wobegone?
"
,,
4,4,"It was the day
"
,,
4,4,"of the tuna hot-dish jamboree...
"
,,
4,4,"Oh, no. Kids, your father's in trouble.
"
,,
4,4," I'm going up there.
"
,,
4,4," I'm coming, too, Mom.
"
,,
4,4,"Oh, my God.
"
,,
4,4,"The guy behind me braided my hair.
"
,,
4,4,"Chris, grab a guitar. Brian, take the drums.
"
,,
4,4,"Here, Stewie, play with this.
"
,,
4,4,"Mom, can we please just get out of here?
"
,,
4,4," Oh, my God.
"
,,
4,4," Who is she?
"
,,
4,4,"God, I could strangle her all night long.
"
,,
4,4,"Boy, that's not healthy, is it?
"
,,
4,4,"That that's the first place I go to?
"
,,
4,4,"Hit it!
"
,,
4,4,"[Singing] <i>Cloudy skies and rain clouds</i>
"
,,
4,4,"You guys were great.
"
,,
4,4,"My name's Jimmy lovine.
"
,,
4,4,"And I'd like to make you
"
,,
4,4,"filthy rich rock stars.
"
,,
4,4,"Wow, you're the chairman of
"
,,
4,4,"Interscope Records.
"
,,
4,4," What're you doing in prison?
"
,,
4,4," I stomped a cat to death.
"
,,
4,4,"Listen, you guys got talent.
"
,,
4,4," Well, where do we sign?
"
,,
4,4," Right here, on Tony's butt cheek.
"
,,
4,4,"And initial here...
"
,,
4,4,"and here.
"
,,
4,4,"And date.
"
,,
4,4,"Oh, crap. Today's the seventeenth.
"
,,
4,4,"[Singing] <i>Gonna buy me a rainbow</i>
"
,,
4,4," How was that, Dr. Ditty?
"
,,
4,4," Yo, that sounds smooth, y'all.
"
,,
4,4,"I just have a...
"
,,
4,4,"God, I'm so sorry. I keep doing that.
"
,,
4,4,"God, please forgive me.
"
,,
4,4,"I get that from my father.
"
,,
4,4,"He's from a different generation.
"
,,
4,4," It's...
"
,,
4,4," Whatever, man.
"
,,
4,4," We cool? We good?
"
,,
4,4," Yeah, we're cool. Fine.
"
,,
4,4,"Mr. Doctor? If you get shot in a rap feud...
"
,,
4,4,"can you perform surgery on yourself?
"
,,
4,4,"Well, no, Chris. My degree's in optometry.
"
,,
4,4,"All right, Dr. Ditty.
"
,,
4,4,"I got three choices for you
"
,,
4,4,"for the name of the band:
"
,,
4,4,"Peter Griffin Starship,
"
,,
4,4,"Peter Griffin and the Sunday Steppers...
"
,,
4,4,"or Testicular Sound Express.
"
,,
4,4,"I think the name is Meg.
"
,,
4,4," Me? Why?
"
,,
4,4," Yeah, why?
"
,,
4,4,"Let me explain something to you, all right?
"
,,
4,4,"We got to get her half-naked
"
,,
4,4,"and put her out front, center stage.
"
,,
4,4,"And that's gonna make y'all billionaires...
"
,,
4,4,"because America loves
"
,,
4,4,"hot, white jailbait ass.
"
,,
4,4,"Wait a minute.
"
,,
4,4,"That's the smartest thing I've ever heard...
"
,,
4,4,"anyone say about anything.
"
,,
4,4,"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Meg
"
,,
4,4,"being exploited that way.
"
,,
4,4,"Shut up, Mom, it's not your decision.
"
,,
4,4,"I want to be exploited.
"
,,
4,4,"Meg, don't you talk to me like that.
"
,,
4,4,"Look, Lois, I love Meal Ticket
"
,,
4,4,"just as much as I love Chris and Stevie...
"
,,
4,4,"but business is business.
"
,,
4,4,"So, let's get this show on the road, huh?
"
,,
4,4,"Good. Now, I just need you to sign this.
"
,,
4,4,"Oh, God. Sorry.
"
,,
4,4,"Oh, my God. That is not me.
"
,,
4,4,"That's not who I am. I vote Democrat.
"
,,
4,4,"It will not happen again.
"
,,
4,4,"We cool? We good?
"
,,
4,4,"You...
"
,,
4,4,"You guys know I have no problem
"
,,
4,4,"with black people, right?
"
,,
4,4,"Yeah. Sure.
"
,,
4,4,"You did say you hated <i>Crooklyn.</i>
"
,,
4,4," Hey, Doc, you got a minute?
"
,,
4,4," What you want, dog?
"
,,
4,4,"Yeah, so, hey, check it out.
"
,,
4,4,"Stewie and I have been working
"
,,
4,4,"on some stuff of our own.
"
,,
4,4,"And we thought there might be a place
"
,,
4,4,"for us to sing on the next album.
"
,,
4,4,"Hey, cool. You're busy. No sweat.
"
,,
4,4,"Boy, <i>Benson</i> was a funny show.
"
,,
4,4," I'll talk to you later.
"
,,
4,4," Well, what did he say?
"
,,
4,4,"He said he'd think about it.
"
,,
4,4,"Okay, so where were we?
"
,,
4,4,"Okay.
"
,,
4,4,"[Singing] <i>I want to have intercourse</i>
"
,,
4,4," Right?
"
,,
4,4," Yeah. No, great, that sounds good.
"
,,
4,4,"All right, groovy.
"
,,
4,4,"Now, is there a shorter word
"
,,
4,4,"for intercourse?
"
,,
4,4,"Lois, go grab me another bag of Skittles.
"
,,
4,4," Excuse me, young lady?
"
,,
4,4," Did I freaking stutter?
"
,,
4,4," I said more Skittles.
"
,,
4,4," All right. That is it, Meg.
"
,,
4,4,"You know, ever since you
"
,,
4,4,"got that makeover...
"
,,
4,4,"you've developed a terrible attitude.
"
,,
4,4,"And all the success with the family band
"
,,
4,4,"is only making it worse.
"
,,
4,4,"The family band?
"
,,
4,4,"You know, maybe you haven't noticed,
"
,,
4,4,"Lois, but I am the band.
"
,,
4,4," Right, Missus Wong?
"
,,
4,4," Yeah, she band. Old lady jealous.
"
,,
4,4,"Peter, we have to do something.
"
,,
4,4,"We're losing our daughter.
"
,,
4,4,"I'm worried about
"
,,
4,4,"what's happening to her.
"
,,
4,4,"Lois, this is the kind of thing...
"
,,
4,4,"that always resolves itself
"
,,
4,4,"if you just ignore it, all right?
"
,,
4,4,"What's more important is
"
,,
4,4,"we're living the sweet life.
"
,,
4,4,"This is even more fun than
"
,,
4,4,"when I performed at the White House.
"
,,
4,4,"Mr. President,
"
,,
4,4,"I present to you Peter Griffin.
"
,,
4,4,"Okay, listen up, everybody.
"
,,
4,4,"I got great news.
"
,,
4,4,"Meg, you and your family are gonna
"
,,
4,4,"perform on <i>Saturday Night Live.</i>
"
,,
4,4,"You mean I'm gonna get to meet
"
,,
4,4,"John Belushi and Gilda Radner...
"
,,
4,4,"and Phil Hartman, and Chris Farley,
"
,,
4,4,"and Horatio Sanz? Sweet!
"
,,
4,4,"I can't think of anything more exciting.
"
,,
4,4,"Oh, my God, a water fountain!
"
,,
4,4,"Meg, I'm Jimmy Fallon.
"
,,
4,4,"It's great to finally meet you. I'm hosting.
"
,,
4,4,"Why don't you come hang out
"
,,
4,4,"in my dressing room?
"
,,
4,4," What are you looking at?
"
,,
4,4," Nothing.
"
,,
4,4,"Come on, let's go.
"
,,
4,4,"Peter, I'm worried about Meg.
"
,,
4,4,"She's spiraling out of control.
"
,,
4,4,"I mean, what if she develops
"
,,
4,4,"a coke problem?
"
,,
4,4,"No Coke. Pepsi.
"
,,
4,4,"Come on, you set me up for that one.
"
,,
4,4,"Wow, Jimmy.
"
,,
4,4,"That was everything
"
,,
4,4,"Awesome, great, thanks.
"
,,
4,4,"You know, there's something I...
"
,,
4,4,"There's something I gotta tell you.
"
,,
4,4,"Being with you just made me feel
"
,,
4,4,"so... Live from New York...
"
,,
4,4,"it's <i>Saturday Night!</i>
"
,,
4,4,"TV HOST: <i>It's</i> Saturday Night Live.
"
,,
4,4,"Oh, my God.
"
,,
4,4,"Yeah, that wasn't a very good
"
,,
4,4,"opening sketch, was it?
"
,,
4,4," A rare miss.
"
,,
4,4," I don't think that was a sketch, Peter.
"
,,
4,4,"Mom, Dad, he used me for comedy.
"
,,
4,4,"Wait a minute.
"
,,
4,4,"Are you telling me
"
,,
4,4,"that my daughter was deflowered...
"
,,
4,4,"in front of one-and-a-half times
"
,,
4,4,"the <i>Mad</i> TVaudience?
"
,,
4,4,"My poor baby.
"
,,
4,4,"My God, Lois, you were right.
"
,,
4,4,"Why the hell didn't I see it coming?
"
,,
4,4,"All right, stand aside.
"
,,
4,4,"It's about time I did my fatherly duty.
"
,,
4,4,"I said ""duty,"" but no time
"
,,
4,4,"to laugh about it now.
"
,,
4,4,"Hey, everybody, it's great to be back.
"
,,
4,4,"So we got a great show tonight and...
"
,,
4,4,"Hey, Fallon, say goodnight, you bum.
"
,,
4,4,"And this is for laughing
"
,,
4,4,"and looking at the camera...
"
,,
4,4,"during every sketch you've ever been in.
"
,,
4,4,"Who do you think you are? Carol Burnett?
"
,,
4,4,"You think because she did it,
"
,,
4,4,"it's okay for you?
"
,,
4,4,"You haven't earned what she's earned,
"
,,
4,4,"buddy.
"
,,
4,4,"All right, now where's the guy
"
,,
4,4,"who slept with my daughter?
"
,,
4,4,"I'm so glad to be the real me again.
"
,,
4,4,"It's too much work being beautiful.
"
,,
4,4,"Not for me, but it's good
"
,,
4,4,"to have you back, pumpkin.
"
,,
4,4,"Well, I guess there's only
"
,,
4,4,"one thing left to do.
"
,,
4,4,"Listen, thanks, everybody.
"
,,
4,4,"I had a great time tonight.
"
,,
4,4,"I want to thank Jimmy Fallon
"
,,
4,4,"for being such a good sport.
"
,,
4,4,"Lois, Meg, Stewie, Brian, Chris,
"
,,
4,4,"the guys from the prison...

"
,,
4,4,"If I'm forgetting anybody, I'm sorry.
"

4,4,"Our thoughts are with you, Chevy!
"
,,
4,4,"TV HOST: <i>From the world famous</i>
"
,,
4,4,"What? I'm tired.
"
,,
4,4,"It has nothing to do with the fact
"
,,
4,4,"that it's a black show.
"
,,
4,4,"What? I can't be tired at 1:00
"
,,
4,4,"in the morning?
"
,,
4,5,"Peter, thanks a lot
"
,,
4,5,"for having us out on your boat.
"
,,
4,5," No problem.
"
,,
4,5," Peter, are you sure Santos and Pasqual...
"
,,
4,5,"don't mind coming in on a Saturday
"
,,
4,5,"to serve us drinks?
"
,,
4,5,"Are you kidding, Lois? They're Portuguese.
"
,,
4,5,"Work is their cocaine.
"
,,
4,5,"Besides, look at them in their tuxedos.
"
,,
4,5,"They look like little people.
"
,,
4,5,"Hey, Meg. What's going on?
"
,,
4,5,"What's going on? You having a good time?
"
,,
4,5,"Yeah, no, I'm having a good time.
"
,,
4,5,"Hey, what's going on?
"
,,
4,5,"Listen, you're 17 now, right?
"
,,
4,5,"I was just throwing it out there.
"
,,
4,5,"I was thinking, you know,
"
,,
4,5,"if you ever want to...
"
,,
4,5,"I don't know, screw around or something.
"
,,
4,5,"Hey, Joe.
"
,,
4,5,"So, you know, it's just something to mull
"
,,
4,5,"around in the old noggin.
"
,,
4,5,"Damn. What is it about golf
"
,,
4,5,"that always brings out the worst in me?
"
,,
4,5,"So, Annika Sorenstam,
"
,,
4,5,"you're quite the female golfer, aren't you?
"
,,
4,5,"Yes, quite the female golfer.
"
,,
4,5,"I knew it! Look! Everybody, look! Look!
"
,,
4,5,"She's a fraud!
"
,,
4,5,"All right, I caught a fish!
"
,,
4,5,"Sorry about that, Loretta.
"
,,
4,5,"Hey, can I have my fish back?
"
,,
4,5,"You're gonna have to reach
"
,,
4,5,"into the cookie jar.
"
,,
4,5,"Well, I can't just...
"
,,
4,5,"You're my best friend's wife.
"
,,
4,5,"Reach into... All right!
"
,,
4,5,"Yeah, you go in and get that.
"
,,
4,5,"Show that fishy who's boss.
"
,,
4,5,"Loretta, they have some of that
"
,,
4,5,"three-bean salad you're so fond of.
"
,,
4,5,"Hey, Quagmire.
"
,,
4,5,"Well, we'll have to do this
"
,,
4,5,"again sometime.
"
,,
4,5,"You name the time and the place,
"
,,
4,5,"little neck.
"
,,
4,5,"I've always loved charades.
"
,,
4,5," Your turn, Joe.
"
,,
4,5," The category is Famous People.
"
,,
4,5," Okay, guess who I am.
"
,,
4,5," Ironside!
"
,,
4,5," Larry Flynt!
"
,,
4,5," Stephen Hawking!
"
,,
4,5," Dr. Strangelove!
"
,,
4,5," Roy Campanella!
"
,,
4,5," Richard Petty!
"
,,
4,5," Lance Armstrong!
"
,,
4,5,"Neil Armstrong! Stretch Armstrong!
"
,,
4,5,"Stretch Cunningham!
"
,,
4,5,"Howard Cunningham! Potsie Weber!
"
,,
4,5,"Natalie Wood. Definitely Natalie Wood.
"
,,
4,5," Somebody save him, he can't swim!
"
,,
4,5," He's not even kicking.
"
,,
4,5," Kick, Joe, kick!
"
,,
4,5," Peter, he's a paraplegic.
"
,,
4,5,"That doesn't mean he can't hear.
"
,,
4,5,"Kick, Joe, kick!
"
,,
4,5,"Somebody help him!
"
,,
4,5,"Gay!
"
,,
4,5,"You were right, Peter.
"
,,
4,5,"It was Natalie Wood.
"
,,
4,5,"Lois, why the hell do we have to
"
,,
4,5,"take a stupid CPR class?
"
,,
4,5,"Because, Peter, none of us knew
"
,,
4,5,"what to do when Joe was drowning.
"
,,
4,5,"Now, be quiet and pay attention.
"
,,
4,5,"Hi, there. I'd like to welcome you all
"
,,
4,5,"to CPR.
"
,,
4,5,"I see a lot of smiles here in this room.
"
,,
4,5,"There's one. There's another.
"
,,
4,5,"That's good.
"
,,
4,5,"I see that soda up under your chair.
"
,,
4,5,"That's all right.
"
,,
4,5,"Soda's all right on my watch.
"
,,
4,5,"We also got Oreos here and fresh coffee.
"
,,
4,5,"Everybody likes a snack.
"
,,
4,5,"Now, who wants to go first?
"
,,
4,5,"No takers? Well, fine. I'll go first.
"
,,
4,5,"Peter, why don't you volunteer?
"
,,
4,5,"No, I don't volunteer for anything
"
,,
4,5,"since I helped those guys...
"
,,
4,5,"repaint the Sistine Chapel.
"
,,
4,5,"Listen, I thought the stuff that was there
"
,,
4,5,"was kind of lame. So I put this up.
"
,,
4,5,"I figured Andre the Giant
"
,,
4,5,"would be a little hipper.
"
,,
4,5,"Get back some of those boys
"
,,
4,5,"you scared away.
"
,,
4,5,"And that's pretty much all there is to it.
"
,,
4,5,"It's hard, jagged, and tastes like alcohol.
"
,,
4,5,"Just like kissing Faye Dunaway.
"
,,
4,5,"Easy now.
"
,,
4,5,"I can't believe we just did that.
"
,,
4,5,"But, you know, that stuff about
"
,,
4,5,"spending the day together tomorrow...
"
,,
4,5,"I forgot. Actually, I have a thing.
"
,,
4,5,"But, you know,
"
,,
4,5,"you have my e-mail address.
"
,,
4,5,"So drop me a line. And then I'll have yours.
"
,,
4,5,"And we'll take it from there. So...
"
,,
4,5,"Bellybutton.
"
,,
4,5,"Well, I'll see you later.
"
,,
4,5,"So, it's official.
"
,,
4,5,"Y'all are card-carrying lifesavers.
"
,,
4,5,"Holy crap, a card with my name on it!
"
,,
4,5,"I am now Peter Griffin, certified CPR.
"
,,
4,5,"Come on, Lois! I've got lives to save.
"
,,
4,5,"Thanks. Be safe.
"
,,
4,5,"Nobody had any of the coffee.
"
,,
4,5,"Only a couple of Oreos gone.
"
,,
4,5,"I'm gonna take the rest home to the cats.
"
,,
4,5,"Sorry, I was dialing the phone.
"
,,
4,5,"Are you all right?
"
,,
4,5,"Don't worry about it.
"
,,
4,5,"Doesn't look like there's any...
"
,,
4,5,"Peter Griffin, certified CPR.
"
,,
4,5,"Don't anyone panic!
"
,,
4,5," What the hell are you doing?
"
,,
4,5," You know, I don't think he's hurt.
"
,,
4,5,"I'll get to you in a moment, sir.
"
,,
4,5,"I'm gonna have to check...
"
,,
4,5,"and see if he soiled himself.
"
,,
4,5," Sir? Sir?
"
,,
4,5," What the hell is wrong with you?
"
,,
4,5," I've got to check if you've soiled yourself.
"
,,
4,5," Get off of me. Are you crazy?
"
,,
4,5,"Sir? I'm gonna need you
"
,,
4,5,"to stop struggling, all right?
"
,,
4,5," Leave him alone.
"
,,
4,5," I hurt my elbow!
"
,,
4,5," I've got to get these trousers off.
"
,,
4,5," Somebody call the cops!
"
,,
4,5," I gotta see if you soiled yourself.
"
,,
4,5," Nobody asked you to get involved!
"
,,
4,5,"Get off him, you jackass!
"
,,
4,5,"I'm gonna need you to step back. All right,
"
,,
4,5,"Looks like we're clean down here.
"
,,
4,5,"You guys take it easy. No need to
"
,,
4,5,"thank me. Just pay it forward.
"
,,
4,5," So they revoked your CPR card, huh?
"
,,
4,5," Yeah.
"
,,
4,5,"This is worse than
"
,,
4,5,"when they took away my library card...
"
,,
4,5,"for reading while intoxicated.
"
,,
4,5,"Don't be ashamed of your hand,
"
,,
4,5,"Johnny Tremain.
"
,,
4,5,"You still live in exciting times.
"
,,
4,5,"Crap!
"
,,
4,5,"Sir, do you know how loud
"
,,
4,5,"you were reading?
"
,,
4,5,"""The life of a silversmith's apprentice
"
,,
4,5,"was not an easy one!""
"
,,
4,5,"I got to figure out some way
"
,,
4,5,"to get that card back.
"
,,
4,5,"You could always take the class again.
"
,,
4,5,"I mean, I'm sure they'd give you
"
,,
4,5,"another card.
"
,,
4,5,"[Screaming]
"
,,
4,5," Hey, do you hear that?
"
,,
4,5," What?
"
,,
4,5,"Sounds like someone screaming.
"
,,
4,5,"What is it, boy?
"
,,
4,5,"What are you trying to say?
"
,,
4,5,"It sounds like Loretta is screaming.
"
,,
4,5," Trouble at the old mill?
"
,,
4,5," What are you, insane?
"
,,
4,5," Somebody fall through the ice?
"
,,
4,5," It's summer.
"
,,
4,5," Bobcat?
"
,,
4,5," [Barking]
"
,,
4,5,"Loretta's in trouble? Come on, boy!
"
,,
4,5,"Peter Griffin,
"
,,
4,5,"temporarily suspended CPR...
"
,,
4,5," Holy crap!
"
,,
4,5," We should go.
"
,,
4,5,"Boy, that was embarrassing, huh?
"
,,
4,5,"Walking in on Loretta and Cleveland
"
,,
4,5,"having sex.
"
,,
4,5," Peter, that wasn't...
"
,,
4,5," You know, for a large, heavyset...
"
,,
4,5,"black guy,
"
,,
4,5,"Cleveland's got a cute, little white ass.
"
,,
4,5,"That wasn't Cleveland.
"
,,
4,5,"It was some white guy.
"
,,
4,5," What was that?
"
,,
4,5," Shut up and put some more...
"
,,
4,5,"of that sugar in my bowl.
"
,,
4,5,"Wait a minute. Brian? If that wasn't
"
,,
4,5,"Cleveland doing it with Loretta...
"
,,
4,5,"then Loretta's having an affair.
"
,,
4,5,"We can't tell anyone about this.
"
,,
4,5,"That is the last thing in the world
"
,,
4,5,"we want to do.
"
,,
4,5,"What a day!
"
,,
4,5,"We've done everything in the world.
"
,,
4,5,"So I guess the only thing left to do...
"
,,
4,5,"is tell you that Loretta Brown
"
,,
4,5,"is having an affair.
"
,,
4,5," Good Lord!
"
,,
4,5," Oh, no!
"
,,
4,5,"My fellow Americans,
"
,,
4,5,"I have not been entirely truthful with you.
"
,,
4,5,"I did ga-googity that girl.
"
,,
4,5,"I ga-shmoigedied her ga-flavety
"
,,
4,5,"with my googus.
"
,,
4,5,"And I am sorry.
"
,,
4,5,"Yeah, any idea who it was, Peter?
"
,,
4,5,"No, we didn't see his face.
"
,,
4,5,"All we know is it's a skinny white guy...
"
,,
4,5,"with a tattoo on his left butt cheek.
"
,,
4,5,"Well, I better tell Cleveland.
"
,,
4,5,"I got a knack for delivering bad news.
"
,,
4,5,"I don't know how to tell you this,
"
,,
4,5,"Mr. DeVanney.
"
,,
4,5,"So I'll let these guys do it.
"
,,
4,5,"[Singing] <i>You have AIDS</i>
"
,,
4,5,"So, listen, Cleveland.
"
,,
4,5,"The reason I asked you out here...
"
,,
4,5,"I've been wanting to talk to you
"
,,
4,5,"about something.
"
,,
4,5,"In <i>Superman II,</i> what is the story
"
,,
4,5,"with that cellophane ""S""...
"
,,
4,5,"that Superman rips off his chest
"
,,
4,5,"and throws at the bad guy?
"
,,
4,5,"Prepare to be destroyed, Superman!
"
,,
4,5," What was that?
"
,,
4,5," Yeah, take that, you jerk.
"
,,
4,5," That was a minor inconvenience.
"
,,
4,5," Yeah, well, that's the idea.
"
,,
4,5," Slowed you down.
"
,,
4,5," I'll say. Ow.
"
,,
4,5," Didn't see that coming, did you?
"
,,
4,5," No.
"
,,
4,5,"Yeah, well, you know, take that.
"
,,
4,5,"Which actually brings me
"
,,
4,5,"to my next point:
"
,,
4,5," Your wife's cheating on you.
"
,,
4,5," What?
"
,,
4,5,"Yeah, it's actually a pretty funny story,
"
,,
4,5,"true story.
"
,,
4,5,"Brian and I walked into your house
"
,,
4,5,"and she was with some guy going...
"
,,
4,5,"Bam, bam, bam.
"
,,
4,5," Peter, maybe...
"
,,
4,5," Hang on, I'm not done.
"
,,
4,5,"Bam, bam.
"
,,
4,5,"And then she's all, ""Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.""
"
,,
4,5,"Bam, bam, bam.
"
,,
4,5,"You want to take it
"
,,
4,5,"from here, Bamm-Bamm?
"
,,
4,5,"Bam-bam, bam-bam.
"
,,
4,5," You want to take it from here, Emeril?
"
,,
4,5," Bam!
"
,,
4,5,"So that's what we're dealing with here.
"
,,
4,5,"Any thoughts?
"
,,
4,5,"Loretta, is it true what they're saying?
"
,,
4,5,"Were you really having carnal relations
"
,,
4,5,"with another gentleman?
"
,,
4,5,"I'm a woman, Cleveland.
"
,,
4,5,"I need some passion in my life.
"
,,
4,5,"I need a real man.
"
,,
4,5,"And Lord knows that ain't you.
"
,,
4,5,"Well, I admit after a long day at work,
"
,,
4,5,"I don't always come home...
"
,,
4,5,"with that ""Riunite on ice,
"
,,
4,5,"that's nice"" mentality.
"
,,
4,5,"And for that, I apologize.
"
,,
4,5,"Apologize? I cheat on you
"
,,
4,5,"and you apologize to me?
"
,,
4,5,"Cleveland Brown, you are pathetic!
"
,,
4,5,"I disagree, but I respect your candor.
"
,,
4,5,"Goodbye, Cleveland.
"
,,
4,5,"I love you.
"
,,
4,5,"[Doorbell ringing]
"
,,
4,5,"Hi, Cleveland.
"
,,
4,5," Hey, what are you doing here?
"
,,
4,5," Loretta kicked me out.
"
,,
4,5,"Cleveland, I am so sorry.
"
,,
4,5,"You can stay here as long as you like.
"
,,
4,5,"Cleveland, sit down.
"
,,
4,5,"I want to sing a little song
"
,,
4,5,"that kept me going when I had troubles.
"
,,
4,5,"[Playing Rock Lobster by the B-52's]
"
,,
4,5,"[Singing]
"
,,
4,5,"Yeah, you're gonna be okay.
"
,,
4,5,"Now, everybody, Cleveland's gonna be
"
,,
4,5,"staying with us for a few days.
"
,,
4,5,"That's right, kids.
"
,,
4,5,"So just treat him like one of the family.
"
,,
4,5,"You mean like Cousin Janine who we're
"
,,
4,5,"polite to but then mock her diabetes...
"
,,
4,5,"on the drive home?
"
,,
4,5,"She can't eat caramel.
"
,,
4,5,"Exactly.
"
,,
4,5,"Can I touch your hair?
"
,,
4,5,"I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna touch it.
"
,,
4,5,"It's like a sheep!
"
,,
4,5,"You know, Peter,
"
,,
4,5,"I'm a little worried about Cleveland.
"
,,
4,5,"His wife cheated on him,
"
,,
4,5,"kicked him out of the house...
"
,,
4,5,"and he doesn't seem at all affected by it.
"
,,
4,5,"He's probably bottling up his emotions.
"
,,
4,5,"That's not good for you.
"
,,
4,5,"Right. I almost got an ulcer
"
,,
4,5,"after you shelled out $200...
"
,,
4,5,"for tickets to <i>Crossing Over</i>
"
,,
4,5,"with John Edward.
"
,,
4,5,"I'm sensing an ""A.""
"
,,
4,5,"Does your name begin with an ""A""?
"
,,
4,5," No.
"
,,
4,5," A ""B""?
"
,,
4,5," No.
"
,,
4,5," C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P?
"
,,
4,5," ""P""! Peter! My name's Peter!
"
,,
4,5," Is your name Peter?
"
,,
4,5,"Wow, you are some kind of sorcerer.
"
,,
4,5,"What Cleveland really needs right now
"
,,
4,5,"is to learn how to express his feelings.
"
,,
4,5,"Now, what he needs right now
"
,,
4,5,"is a revenge lay.
"
,,
4,5,"And I know just who to talk to.
"
,,
4,5,"[Doorbell ringing]
"
,,
4,5," Oh, God!
"
,,
4,5," Sorry, guys. Let me throw something on.
"
,,
4,5," Peter, look!
"
,,
4,5," Holy crap, that's the tattoo!
"
,,
4,5,"Well, I think we're about to find out
"
,,
4,5,"who the culprit is.
"
,,
4,5," Peter, l...
"
,,
4,5," Shut up, Brian! I'm sleuthing.
"
,,
4,5,"[Phone ringing]
"
,,
4,5," Hello?
"
,,
4,5," Quagmire?
"
,,
4,5," Yeah.
"
,,
4,5," Hey, it's Peter.
"
,,
4,5,"What's going on, buddy?
"
,,
4,5,"We're at your house.
"
,,
4,5,"Peter, he's the one we saw
"
,,
4,5,"sleeping with Loretta!
"
,,
4,5,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
4,5,"Damn it, I knew this was gonna happen!
"
,,
4,5,"I didn't mean it, you know?
"
,,
4,5,"I knew it was a mistake!
"
,,
4,5,"It never felt right!
"
,,
4,5,"Please don't tell Cleveland!
"
,,
4,5,"Well, all right, Quagmire.
"
,,
4,5,"Cleveland, Quagmire's sleeping
"
,,
4,5,"with your wife!
"
,,
4,5," What?
"
,,
4,5," Quagmire slept with Loretta?
"
,,
4,5,"Oh, my God, Cleveland! I am so sorry.
"
,,
4,5,"I can only imagine
"
,,
4,5,"what you must be feeling right now.
"
,,
4,5,"It's okay.
"
,,
4,5,"It's okay? It's okay to be betrayed
"
,,
4,5,"by your wife and best friend?
"
,,
4,5,"Better it be Quagmire than someone
"
,,
4,5,"she could get a disease from.
"
,,
4,5,"Cleveland, don't you see?
"
,,
4,5,"This is why your wife left you.
"
,,
4,5,"You don't have any passion.
"
,,
4,5,"Sometimes a woman wants to see
"
,,
4,5,"her man be a man.
"
,,
4,5,"You got to push back a little!
"
,,
4,5,"You got to get a little rough!
"
,,
4,5,"Oh, God! Peter, hit me!
"
,,
4,5,"Yeah!
"
,,
4,5,"Wow, so that's something,
"
,,
4,5,"about Quagmire and Loretta, huh?
"
,,
4,5,"Cleveland, we got to get
"
,,
4,5,"your manhood back.
"
,,
4,5,"Now, the first thing we're gonna do...
"
,,
4,5,"is take you to a good, old-fashioned,
"
,,
4,5,"wrestling match.
"
,,
4,5,"All right, Cleveland.
"
,,
4,5,"Nothing like a good smackdown...
"
,,
4,5,"to get the testosterone going.
"
,,
4,5,"You take that back,
"
,,
4,5,"Macho Man Randy Savage!
"
,,
4,5,"Doesn't he make you so mad you just...
"
,,
4,5," want to go down there and hit him?
"
,,
4,5," No.
"
,,
4,5,"Well, maybe not him
"
,,
4,5,"'cause he's kind of big.
"
,,
4,5,"But don't you want to hit the guy
"
,,
4,5,"sitting next to you?
"
,,
4,5,"Not him 'cause he's kind of big, too.
"
,,
4,5,"But don't you want to hit his kid?
"
,,
4,5,"Take that, Macho Man Randy Savage.
"
,,
4,5,"You jerk.
"
,,
4,5,"All right, Cleveland. If this doesn't
"
,,
4,5,"light a fire in your belly, nothing will.
"
,,
4,5,"Hey, look at me. I'm Quagmire.
"
,,
4,5,"I had sex with your wife.
"
,,
4,5,"Those are so his mannerisms.
"
,,
4,5," Peter, what the hell are you doing?
"
,,
4,5," I'm not Peter, I'm Quagmire.
"
,,
4,5," And I'm doing you, Loretta.
"
,,
4,5," What the hell?
"
,,
4,5," You like that? Yeah.
"
,,
4,5," Hey!
"
,,
4,5," Much better than Cleveland.
"
,,
4,5," Peter, knock it off!
"
,,
4,5," Get you damn hands off me...
"
,,
4,5," You like it dirty, don't you?
"
,,
4,5,"What the hell are you doing?
"
,,
4,5,"What is that in your pocket?
"
,,
4,5," Lois! Somebody!
"
,,
4,5," Quagmire's got you. Yeah.
"
,,
4,5,"Glenn Quagmire, you're dead!
"
,,
4,5,"[Theme music from Popeye]
"
,,
4,5,"All right, calm down, Cleveland.
"
,,
4,5,"I'm gonna kill Quagmire!
"
,,
4,5,"Oh, God, you're hyperventilating!
"
,,
4,5,"Chris, get me a bag.
"
,,
4,5,"Okay, Cleveland, breathe into the bag.
"
,,
4,5,"It'll calm you down.
"
,,
4,5," Peter, I'm not sure that that's...
"
,,
4,5," Not now, Lois!
"
,,
4,5,"Okay, Cleveland, Cleveland,
"
,,
4,5,"relax, relax, relax.
"
,,
4,5,"Relax, relax.
"
,,
4,5,"There you go. There you go. Okay.
"
,,
4,5,"It's okay. It's okay.
"
,,
4,5," It's all gonna be okay.
"
,,
4,5," Peter, you better do your CPR.
"
,,
4,5,"There's no time. I got to go warn
"
,,
4,5,"Quagmire while I got the chance.
"
,,
4,5,"Quick, to the Peter copter!
"
,,
4,5,"[Peter screaming]
"
,,
4,5,"Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, my God!
"
,,
4,5," Peter, what the hell?
"
,,
4,5," Joe, get inside!
"
,,
4,5," The blades are still spinning!
"
,,
4,5," Oh, my God, Peter! What is that thing?
"
,,
4,5," Joe! Get inside!
"
,,
4,5," It's tearing up my yard!
"
,,
4,5," Oh, my God!
"
,,
4,5," No!
"
,,
4,5," Joe, I am sorry, buddy.
"
,,
4,5," It's okay. Look, it's okay.
"
,,
4,5," Are you okay? You all right?
"
,,
4,5," It's okay. I'm fine.
"
,,
4,5," Everybody's fine.
"
,,
4,5," That was scary.
"
,,
4,5," Peter, what are we doing here?
"
,,
4,5," Trust me, Quagmire.
"
,,
4,5,"Cleveland will never think to look
"
,,
4,5,"for you at Mayor West's house.
"
,,
4,5," Hey, there.
"
,,
4,5," How you doing?
"
,,
4,5,"Good evening, gentlemen.
"
,,
4,5,"Listen, Mayor West,
"
,,
4,5,"my friend Quagmire here's in trouble.
"
,,
4,5," He needs a place to stay tonight.
"
,,
4,5," Say no more. I'll protect you, sir.
"
,,
4,5,"It is my job. I only ask
"
,,
4,5,"that you do not feed my cat, Bootsie...
"
,,
4,5,"as he's already eaten and might throw up.
"
,,
4,5,"Mother, change him back.
"
,,
4,5,"You know, Endora,
"
,,
4,5,"I'm getting a little sick of this crap.
"
,,
4,5,"You ever seen one of these? Huh?
"
,,
4,5,"You know what this is? Huh?
"
,,
4,5," No!
"
,,
4,5," Yeah, it's holy water. Huh? Yeah.
"
,,
4,5,"Try it. How's that feel?
"
,,
4,5,"You like that?
"
,,
4,5,"Power of Christ compels you, bitch.
"
,,
4,5,"I hate <i>Bewitched.</i>
"
,,
4,5,"Hey, so that's a pretty
"
,,
4,5,"reasonable reaction, huh?
"
,,
4,5,"It's all right to go to sleep, my friend.
"
,,
4,5,"I'll stand guard.
"
,,
4,5,"Okay.
"
,,
4,5,"Don't worry. I'll be here all night.
"
,,
4,5,"Just don't try to make me smile.
"
,,
4,5,"I'm forbidden to smile.
"
,,
4,5,"Oh, no.
"
,,
4,5,"That episode of <i>Growing Pains</i>
"
,,
4,5,"when Mike's friend Boner...
"
,,
4,5,"ran for student council.
"
,,
4,5,"Boner.
"
,,
4,5,"His name was Boner.
"
,,
4,5," I've failed you.
"
,,
4,5," This is kind of creeping me out.
"
,,
4,5," I'm gonna go.
"
,,
4,5," Take this, for protection.
"
,,
4,5,"What the hell's this for?
"
,,
4,5,"When the time comes, you'll know.
"
,,
4,5,"I'll teach him to mess with my wife.
"
,,
4,5,"Hi, Cleveland.
"
,,
4,5,"Will you be joining us for dinner?
"
,,
4,5,"[Cleveland growls]
"
,,
4,5," Okay, then.
"
,,
4,5," He's a Rocky machine!
"
,,
4,5,"Peter, we have got to do something
"
,,
4,5,"about Cleveland.
"
,,
4,5,"I think you created a monster.
"
,,
4,5,"Well, there's only one thing to do, Lois.
"
,,
4,5,"We've got to get
"
,,
4,5,"Loretta and Cleveland back together.
"
,,
4,5,"And I know just how to do it.
"
,,
4,5,"To the Hinden-Peter!
"
,,
4,5,"JOE: Oh, my God!
"
,,
4,5,"PETER: Joe, I am so sorry.
"
,,
4,5,"How can you afford these things?
"
,,
4,5,"[Answering machine beeping]
"
,,
4,5,"Yeah, Cleveland, this is Quagmire.
"
,,
4,5,"Listen, I feel awful.
"
,,
4,5,"Why don't you come on over and we can...
"
,,
4,5,"try to get things back
"
,,
4,5,"to the way they used to be?
"
,,
4,5,"Remember how it was?
"
,,
4,5,"[In pseudo-Czech accent] Perhaps here
"
,,
4,5,"there are many unsuspecting foxes...
"
,,
4,5,"to have sex with us.
"
,,
4,5,"[In pseudo-Czech accent] That is why
"
,,
4,5,"we wear tight pants to show our bulges.
"
,,
4,5," We are two wild and crazy guys!
"
,,
4,5," Two wild and crazy guys!
"
,,
4,5,"You guys look stupid.
"
,,
4,5,"Anyway, let's talk this thing through.
"
,,
4,5,"Hey, Cleveland.
"
,,
4,5,"I was just leaving you a message.
"
,,
4,5,"You violated the sanctity of my marriage.
"
,,
4,5,"When the time comes, you'll know.
"
,,
4,5,"QUAGMIRE: Damn it!
"
,,
4,5,"This is awful!
"
,,
4,5,"Somebody stop them! Do something!
"
,,
4,5,"Good. Let the hate flow through you.
"
,,
4,5,"You're not helping!
"
,,
4,5,"I can't.
"
,,
4,5,"It isn't in me to cause harm to anyone.
"
,,
4,5,"No matter how much
"
,,
4,5,"someone has harmed me.
"
,,
4,5,"I'm sorry, Cleveland.
"
,,
4,5,"Cleveland, I think this beautiful woman
"
,,
4,5,"would like to say something to you.
"
,,
4,5,"You told me this was Lois' intervention.
"
,,
4,5," Nice. Cleveland?
"
,,
4,5," Loretta, what you did was unforgivable.
"
,,
4,5," This marriage is over.
"
,,
4,5," Well, that's just fine, Cleveland.
"
,,
4,5,"'Cause I am through being your wife.
"
,,
4,5,"Well, I may not be perfect,
"
,,
4,5,"but I deserve better than you.
"
,,
4,5,"Look at that, Lois.
"
,,
4,5,"As beautiful as an HBO minority fairytale.
"
,,
4,5,"But, Peter, their marriage is ending.
"
,,
4,5,"Look at the bright side, Lois.
"
,,
4,5,"It's a chance for a fresh start
"
,,
4,5,"for both Cleveland and...
"
,,
4,5,"[Audience applauding]
"
,,
4,5,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
4,5,"What are you doing?
"
,,
4,5," What's wrong with you?
"
,,
4,5," What the hell, man?
"
,,
4,5," Hurts, doesn't it?
"
,,
4,5," What the hell... Yes!
"
,,
4,5,"What the hell's your problem?
"
,,
4,5," My friend? My friend?
"
,,
4,5," What?
"
,,
4,5," You've been kicked in the...
"
,,
4,5," No way!

"
,,
4,6,"Yeah, this will be a lot more fun
"

4,6,"than last Saturday...
"

4,6,"when we went to see

4,6,"Man, does anyone ever win at this game?
"

4,6,"You don't win.
"
,,
4,6,"You just do a little better each time.
"
,,
4,6,"Okay, everybody, time for paintball.
"
,,
4,6,"I forgot to pick up the paintball guns.
"
,,
4,6,"Well, we could use these.
"
,,
4,6,"I brought them from the office.
"
,,
4,6,"Peter, is it safe to be firing real guns
"
,,
4,6,"at each other in the house?
"
,,
4,6,"All right, all right, nobody fire at Lois.
"

4,6,"She's scared.

4,6,"Trivial Pursuit.
"
,,
4,6,"Man, I hate Trivial Pursuit.
"
,,
4,6,"Always makes me feel so stupid.
"

4,6,"More stupid than that time
"

4,6,"[Whispering] I switched Peter's questions

"

4,6,"This is not a race.
"

4,6,"Okay, I wanna say ""who.""

4,6,"I just smoked a whole bunch of crack.
"

4,6,"Good night, losers.
"
,,
4,6,"Well, game night was a success.
"
,,
4,6,"Peter, you do know that all your questions
"
,,
4,6,"were incredibly easy.
"
,,
4,6,"Yeah, easy for me. Good night, morons.
"
,,
4,6,"You ever stop and think,

4,6,"I agree as well. Shallow and pedantic.
"

4,6,"Everything all right. Peter?
"
,,
4,6,"Well, Lois, since you asked, I find
"
,,
4,6,"this meatloaf rather shallow and pedantic.
"
,,
4,6,"What is this,
"
,,
4,6,"you're gonna talk down to everyone...
"
,,
4,6,"just because you won a game
"
,,
4,6,"of Trivial Pursuit?
"
,,
4,6,"Perhaps.
"
,,
4,6,"Okay, you know what?
"
,,
4,6,"Fine, you are a genius, Peter.
"
,,
4,6,"As a matter of fact, let's make it official.
"
,,
4,6,"You ever heard
"

4,6,"of the MacArthur genius grant?
"
,,
4,6,"Perhaps.
"
,,
4,6,"Well, if you qualify as a genius...
"
,,
4,6,"the Foundation will give you
"

4,6,"a $500,000 grant...
"

4,6,"just to sit around

4,6,"and do whatever you want.
"

"
,,
4,6,"All right, Cloris Leachman,

"
,,
4,6,"Peter, according to this,
"

4,6,"you're not a genius.
"
,,
4,6,"In fact, you're mentally retarded.
"
,,
4,6,"Oh, yeah?
"
,,
4,6,"Well, would a mentally retarded guy...
"
,,
4,6,"Oh, yeah?
"
,,
4,6,"Well, would a mentally retarded guy...
"

4,6,"have hired a bulldozer with a drunk driver

4,6,"to level half of his house...

"

4,6,"Maybe.
"

4,6,"Uh-oh.
"

4,6,"Congratulations.
"

4,6,"So, as you can see, you are just
"

4,6,"over the line of mental retardation.
"

4,6,"Don't you mean, just under the line?
"
,,
4,6,"The day I'm corrected by a...

"
,,
4,6,"That's right, senior prom.
"
,,
4,6,"Yeah. Yeah, it's been a while, yeah.
"
,,
4,6,"So, listen.
"
,,
4,6,"I just found out I'm retarded.
"
,,
4,6,"And I'm just calling to let you know...
"
,,
4,6,"you might want to get yourself tested.
"
,,
4,6,"Hello?
"
,,
4,6,"Peter, mental retardation usually happens
"
,,
4,6,"before you're born.
"
,,
4,6,"It isn't something you can catch.
"
,,
4,6,"Don't you think you're overreacting?
"
,,
4,6,"Well, excuse me for being retarded.
"
,,
4,6,"My whole world
"
,,
4,6,"has been turned upside down.
"
,,
4,6,"Black is east, up is white.
"
,,
4,6,"You know, Peter, I hate to say ""I told you
"
,,
4,6,"so"" about not being a genius, but...
"
,,
4,6,"yeah! In your... face,!
"
,,
4,6,"I'm sorry about that.
"
,,
4,6,"I can't believe this is happening to me.
"
,,
4,6,"I can never go back to school again.
"
,,
4,6,"Oh, yes, Meg, yes.
"
,,
4,6,"Yes, everything was going
"
,,
4,6,"swimmingly for you until this.
"
,,
4,6,"Yes, this is the thing
"
,,
4,6,"that will ruin your reputation.
"
,,
4,6,"Not your years of grotesque appearance
"
,,
4,6,"or awkward social graces...
"
,,
4,6,"or that Felix Unger-ish way
"
,,
4,6,"you clear your sinuses.
"

4,6,"No, no, no, it's this.
"
,,
4,6,"Do you hear yourself talk?
"

4,6,"I might kill you tonight.
"
,,
4,6,"Peter, you're still you.
"

4,6,"No piece of paper from the city
"
,,
4,6,"is gonna tell me...
"
,,
4,6,"you're any different
"
,,
4,6,"from the man I married.
"
,,
4,6,"And your life's not gonna change
"
,,
4,6,"because of it.
"

"
,,
4,6,"Peter, watch out!
"
,,
4,6,"So what can I do for you, Peter?
"
,,
4,6,"Well, Joe, I need to talk to you
"
,,
4,6,"about something kind of personal.
"
,,
4,6," Shoot.
"
,,
4,6," Well, you know, I took this test...
"
,,
4,6,"and it sort of turns out
"
,,
4,6,"that I'm technically mentally retarded.
"
,,
4,6,"And, you know, I just wanted to ask...
"
,,
4,6,"you know, how do you deal with it?
"
,,
4,6," Deal with what?
"
,,
4,6," You know, with being retarded.
"
,,
4,6,"Peter, I'm not retarded. I'm handicapped.
"
,,

"
,,
4,6,"Now, let's just try to enjoy our meal.
"
,,
4,6,"I kind of get the helmet.
"
,,
4,6,"But what's with the water wings?
"
,,
4,6,"Well, you did order the soup.
"
,,
4,6,"Like something could happen...
"
,,
4,6,"Get me out!
"
,,
4,6,"These water wings didn't help at all.

4,6,"Now, there are plenty of people
"
,,
4,6,"who have had worse days.
"

4,6,"A parking ticket. I was gone five minutes.
"
,,
4,6,"How could this day get any worse?
"
,,
4,6,"Oh, my God.
"
,,
4,6,"Oh, no!
"
,,
4,6,"I wish I could just close my eyes
"
,,
4,6,"and make all this go away.
"
,,
4,6,"Peter, look out!
"
,,
4,6,"Holy crap!
"
,,
4,6,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
4,6,"Mr. Tucker, are you all right?
"
,,
4,6,"Do I look like I'm all right?
"

4,6,"My back is broken and my leg is twisted!
"
,,
4,6,"Oh, my God! Your hooker's dead.
"
,,
4,6,"Well, she was already dead,
"
,,
4,6,"but that doesn't excuse...
"
,,
4,6,"Wait a minute.
"
,,
4,6,"You're Peter Griffin, the retarded fellow.
"
,,
4,6," Yeah.
"
,,
4,6," Well, then don't worry about it.
"
,,
4,6,"Wait a minute. You mean
"

4,6,"you're not even gonna call the cops?

4,6,"Peter, I don't like this.

4,6,"Hang on a sec.

4,6,"Okay, so these two black guys
"

4,6,"walk into a bar, and the bartender looks...
"
,,
4,6,"Hey, what are you guys talking about?
"
,,
4,6,"I was just telling a joke.
"
,,
4,6,"So, the bartender looks around and says:
"
,,
4,6,"""What'll you two fine gentlemen have?""

4,6,"Oh, God! You're a monster.
"
,,
4,6,"I'm beautiful on the inside.
"
,,
4,6,"Yeah, but, Rocky, there's a limit.
"
,,
4,6,"What is this now?
"
,,
4,6,"Does your face have a pelvis?
"
,,
4,6,"Oh, God, what have I done?
"
,,
4,6,"I'm the worst husband ever.
"
,,
4,6,"Make that the worst father ever.
"
,,
4,6,"Hi, I'm Agent Jessup from Child Services.
"
,,
4,6,"I'm here to take your kids away.
"
,,
4,6,"What? Why?
"
,,

"
,,
4,6,"No way!

,,

4,6,"I'll tell you tomorrow.
"
,,
4,6,"Thanks for letting my friends sleep over,
"
,,
4,6,"Mr. Brown.
"
,,
4,6,"No problem, Meg.
"
,,
4,6,"If y'all get hungry,
"
,,
4,6,"there's some cottage cheese in the fridge.
"
,,
4,6,"I'm gonna get me a spoonful now
"
,,
4,6,"before y'all have at it.
"
,,
4,6,"Oh, my God.
"
,,
4,6,"Craig Hoffman's new car is so cool.
"
,,
4,6,"Oh, my God. Totally. I love the color.
"
,,
4,6,"Really? What color is it?
"
,,
4,6,"It's like blue, kind of blue-green.
"
,,
4,6,"It's the same color as his eyes.
"
,,
4,6,"Wow. I bet he looks so hot driving it.
"
,,
4,6,"I heard he bought it from his dad.
"
,,
4,6,"Yeah, I remember his dad
"
,,
4,6,"dropped him off at school in it...
"
,,
4,6,"one time when he was a freshman.
"
,,
4,6," Doesn't his dad live in Hartford?
"
,,
4,6," I think so.
"
,,
4,6,"My aunt Sheila lives in Hartford.
"
,,
4,6,"They have a mall there that's pretty cool.
"
,,
4,6,"It's part underground.
"
,,
4,6,"That's awesome.
"
,,
4,6,"Damn it, you guys are boring
"
,,
4,6,"the crap out of me.
"
,,
4,6,"It's stupid, mindless chatter, is what it is.
"
,,
4,6,"You know what I'm gonna do?
"
,,
4,6,"I'm just gonna go back to my place
"
,,
4,6,"and rent a dirty movie.
"
,,
4,6,"This is ridiculous.
"
,,
4,6,"That was weird. Oh, well.
"
,,
4,6,"Hey, let's compare breasts.
"
,,
4,6,"Lois? Hey, how you doing, honey?
"
,,
4,6,"Listen, there's no toilet paper
"
,,
4,6,"in the bathroom...
"
,,
4,6,"so, I'm just gonna...
"
,,
4,6,"There we go.
"
,,
4,6,"[Toilet flushing]
"
,,
4,6,"Oh, God. Hang on!
"
,,
4,6,"The doctors still don't know how
"
,,
4,6,"much longer she's gonna have to be here.
"
,,
4,6,"I feel horrible, Brian.
"
,,
4,6,"I put Lois in the hospital, and I lost the
"
,,
4,6,"kids.
"
,,
4,6,"This is turning out worse
"
,,
4,6,"than Stewie's iPod commercial.
"
,,
4,6,"Peter, you just need to show
"
,,
4,6,"what a good father you are.
"
,,
4,6,"Then you can get
"
,,
4,6,"the kids back from Cleveland.
"
,,
4,6,"Wait a second, Brian. You're right.
"
,,
4,6,"And the best way to do that is to show
"
,,
4,6,"what a terrible father Cleveland is.
"
,,
4,6,"This plan is so perfect, it's retarded.
"
,,
4,6,"[Whistling]
"
,,
4,6,"All right, come on, ladies. Right this way.
"
,,
4,6,"This'll show them
"
,,
4,6,"that Cleveland's not fit to be a parent.
"
,,
4,6,"So, tell me, is there any tread left
"
,,
4,6,"on the tires at all?
"
,,
4,6,"Or at this point, would it be like
"
,,
4,6,"throwing a hot dog down a hallway?
"
,,
4,6,"Oh, my Lord. Look who's here.
"
,,
4,6,"Agent Jessup,
"
,,
4,6,"look at all these prostitutes.
"
,,
4,6,"[Singing] <i>One, two, three, four,</i>
"
,,
4,6,"Seven. Seven prostitutes.
"
,,
4,6,"This is a shakedown.
"
,,
4,6,"Mr. Griffin, this isn't going to work.
"
,,
4,6,"Yeah. Peter, you and five
"
,,
4,6,"of those prostitutes, get out.
"
,,
4,6,"So, in conclusion, Peter Griffin,
"
,,
4,6,"you've inspired me...
"
,,
4,6,"to distrust
"
,,
4,6,"all mentally challenged parents.
"
,,
4,6,"Thank you, Your Honor.
"
,,
4,6,"And thank you, Agent Jessup,
"
,,
4,6,"for your comically misleading remarks.
"
,,
4,6,"Mr. Griffin, do you have anything to say
"
,,
4,6,"in your defense...
"
,,
4,6,"as to why this court should return custody
"
,,
4,6,"of your children to you?
"
,,
4,6,"Your Honor, I would like to call
"
,,
4,6,"to the stand my surprise witness...
"
,,
4,6,"The Ghost That Never Lies.
"
,,
4,6,"[Exclaiming in surprise]
"
,,
4,6,"But I'm the only one
"
,,
4,6,"who can see him and hear him...
"
,,
4,6,"so I'll let everyone know
"
,,
4,6,"what he's saying and doing.
"
,,
4,6,"Objection, Your Honor. This is ridiculous.
"
,,
4,6,"Overruled. I'll allow it.
"
,,
4,6,"You better be going somewhere
"
,,
4,6,"with this, Mr. Griffin.
"
,,
4,6,"Thank you, Your Honor.
"
,,
4,6,"Ghost That Never Lies...
"
,,
4,6,"did you witness the events
"
,,
4,6,"that took place on that fateful day?
"
,,
4,6,"You did? Well, how interesting.
"
,,
4,6,"And, do you see the culprit or culprits
"
,,
4,6,"in this courtroom today?
"
,,
4,6,"You do?
"
,,
4,6,"Well, would you kindly
"
,,
4,6,"point him or them out for this court?
"
,,
4,6,"Don't point at me, you jackass!
"
,,
4,6,"Well, if there's nothing further,
"
,,
4,6,"I hereby sentence...
"
,,
4,6,"Wait, wait, wait.
"
,,
4,6,"Your Honor, there is something further.
"
,,
4,6,"Look, I know I screwed up big time.
"
,,
4,6,"But I only did it
"
,,
4,6,"so I could get my kids back.
"
,,
4,6,"I love them.
"
,,
4,6,"And I think it's a bum rap
"
,,
4,6,"that just because I'm retarded...
"
,,
4,6,"that makes me an unfit parent.
"
,,
4,6,"There are plenty of unfit parents out there
"
,,
4,6,"who aren't retarded...
"
,,
4,6,"but they get to keep their kids.
"
,,
4,6,"Bing Crosby, Joan Crawford.
"
,,
4,6,"I think the Ramseys still got one left.
"
,,
4,6,"I just want them back, Your Honor,
"
,,
4,6,"and you're the only one who can help me.
"
,,
4,6,"What do you say?
"
,,
4,6,"Are you kidding? You're a monster.
"
,,
4,6,"In fact, if I could...
"
,,
4,6,"I would put you in a place where you
"
,,
4,6,"would be removed from the general public.
"
,,
4,6,"Perhaps locked in a big, secure building
"
,,
4,6,"with other dangerous people...
"
,,
4,6,"for a pre-determined period of time...
"
,,
4,6,"based on the nature and degree
"
,,
4,6,"of your offense.
"
,,
4,6,"Unfortunately, as far as I know,
"
,,
4,6,"no such place exists.
"
,,
4,6,"So I have no choice but to set you free.
"
,,
4,6,"Does that mean I get my kids back?
"
,,
4,6,"Absolutely not. Case closed.
"
,,
4,6,"Oh, crap!
"
,,
4,6,"It was prison you were thinking of. Prison.
"
,,
4,6,"I already banged the hammer.
"
,,
4,6,"MAN: [On TV] <i>And now,</i>
"
,,
4,6,"Hey, look over here on the carpet.
"
,,
4,6,"That's a cigarette butt.
"
,,
4,6,"This is probably evidence.
"
,,
4,6,"What do you think was in that Danish?
"
,,
4,6,"You think it was cheese?
"
,,
4,6,"'Cause I got a little problem with cheese.
"
,,
4,6,"Hey, I'm talking about evidence here.
"
,,
4,6,"There's lipstick on it.
"
,,
4,6,"Yeah, well, can you bring it over to me?
"
,,
4,6,"I can't move it. This is a crime scene.
"
,,
4,6,"Well, can you describe it to me?
"
,,
4,6,"You know what? Forget it.
"
,,
4,6,"I'll take care of this, okay?
"
,,
4,6,"Oh, no. Just...
"
,,
4,6,"Just let me close my eyes for a minute.
"
,,
4,6,"Look, I know his wife is a smoker.
"
,,
4,6,"Just yesterday,
"
,,
4,6,"when we saw her at the country club...
"
,,
4,6,"she had a cigarette in her hand.
"
,,
4,6,"[Snoring]
"
,,
4,6,"What, so that's it, Peter?
"
,,
4,6,"You're just giving up?
"
,,
4,6,"I don't know what else to do, Brian.
"
,,
4,6,"I guess we're never
"
,,
4,6,"gonna be a family again.
"
,,
4,6," Hi, Peter.
"
,,
4,6," Oh, my God, Lois.
"
,,
4,6," You're all better.
"
,,
4,6," That's right.
"
,,
4,6,"And the doctors say I'll smell like
"
,,
4,6,"French fries for the next six months.
"
,,
4,6,"I'll enjoy that.
"
,,
4,6,"And, Peter, I got a surprise for you.
"
,,
4,6,"You got the kids back.
"
,,
4,6,"I love you so much,
"
,,
4,6,"delicious French-fry wife.
"
,,
4,6,"Now we can live with you again
"
,,
4,6,"even though you're a dangerous retard.
"
,,
4,6,"Don't say ""retard,"" Chris.
"
,,
4,6,"We prefer to be called ""little people.""
"
,,
4,6,"Because there's nothing wrong
"
,,
4,6,"with being mentally challenged.
"
,,
4,6,"In fact, I've learned
"
,,
4,6,"that we are superior people.
"
,,
4,6,"Above all you dumb brainy smarties.
"
,,
4,6,"Someday, you will beg us for mercy
"
,,
4,6,"and we will consider it.
"
,,
4,6,"Isn't it wonderful
"
,,
4,6,"that everything's back to normal?
"
,,
4,6,"Yeah.
"
,,
4,6,"Oh, God. Nobody move.
"
,,
4,6," What is it?
"
,,
4,6," Nothing. Nothing. I'll get it.
"
,,
4,7,"[Singing] <i>It seems today that all you see</i>
"
,,
4,7,"[People laughing]
"
,,
4,7,"This is ridiculous.
"
,,
4,7,"Why did y'all drag me here?
"
,,
4,7,"Because you can't just
"
,,
4,7,"sit home every night since Loretta left.
"
,,
4,7,"You got to get out and meet some women.
"
,,
4,7,"Well, I suppose I could give it a try.
"
,,
4,7,"Hey, baby. How'd you like to go black
"
,,
4,7,"and then have to make...
"
,,
4,7,"a difficult decision regarding
"
,,
4,7,"whether or not to go back?
"
,,
4,7,"Sorry, I went burnt sienna
"
,,
4,7,"and I never went back.
"
,,
4,7,"Ready, baby? Who's this clown?
"
,,
4,7,"Open up, Stewie.
"
,,
4,7,"The airplane's coming in for a landing.
"
,,
4,7,"I guess the pilot must have been
"
,,
4,7,"JFK Junior.
"
,,
4,7,"Even I found that to be in bad taste.
"
,,
4,7,"Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.
"
,,
4,7,"Good morning, Chris. Oh, my God!
"
,,
4,7,"Look at the size of that pimple.
"
,,
4,7,"You're like a circus freak!
"
,,
4,7,"I'm kidding.
"
,,
4,7,"You're just becoming a man, sweetie.
"
,,
4,7,"Yeah. I remember when I became a man.
"
,,
4,7,"The operation was a success.
"
,,
4,7,"What are you gonna go by now?
"
,,
4,7,"Peter.
"
,,
4,7,"You know, Chris, we'll have to
"
,,
4,7,"do something about that.
"
,,
4,7,"But I don't wanna get rid of my zit.
"
,,
4,7,"I like him. He's my friend.
"
,,
4,7,"His name is Doug.
"
,,
4,7,"I just wish I didn't have to look at it.
"
,,
4,7,"We have to look at your anus all day.
"
,,
4,7,"Thank you.
"
,,
4,7,"The Bachelorette <i>comes to Quahog</i>
"
,,
4,7,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
4,7,"That's, like, my favorite show ever.
"
,,
4,7,"Meg, how can you watch that crap?
"
,,
4,7,"That show is not reality. It's all staged.
"
,,
4,7,"It's a complete mockery
"
,,
4,7,"of human relationships.
"
,,
4,7,"You know, this could be the perfect way
"
,,
4,7,"for Cleveland to meet Mrs. Right.
"
,,
4,7,"I got to tell him. Hey, Cleveland.
"
,,
4,7,"Joe? Sorry, I dialed the wrong number.
"
,,
4,7,"I meant to call Cleveland.
"
,,
4,7,"No, I just wanted to tell him something.
"
,,
4,7,"No, I'd like to talk to you, too.
"
,,
4,7,"It's just that...
"
,,
4,7,"Fine. I'll call you after I talk to Cleveland.
"
,,
4,7,"I don't feel obligated. I want to.
"
,,
4,7,"You're a good pimple, Doug.
"
,,
4,7,"Feed me.
"
,,
4,7,"You can talk?
"
,,
4,7,"That's right.
"
,,
4,7,"And we're gonna raise some hell.
"
,,
4,7,"All right! Raise some hell!
"
,,
4,7,"So, why would you be a good candidate
"
,,
4,7,"on <i>The Bachelorette?</i>
"
,,
4,7,"I would be perfect for your show...
"
,,
4,7,"because I know
"
,,
4,7,"how to talk dirty to the ladies.
"
,,
4,7,"Oh, yes. Oh, yes. That feels so good.
"
,,
4,7,"Spit in my mouth.
"
,,
4,7,"Two hundred auditions and nothing.
"
,,
4,7,"We still got one guy waiting.
"
,,
4,7,"You lined up 201 auditions?
"
,,
4,7,"What a weird number.
"
,,
4,7,"You're weird.
"
,,
4,7,"Peter, I can't do this.
"
,,
4,7,"I am too nervous. I got to go.
"
,,
4,7,"No, Cleveland,
"
,,
4,7,"I'm not gonna let you do this.
"
,,
4,7,"I'll tie you down, if I have to.
"
,,
4,7,"Peter, this is only making it worse.
"
,,
4,7,"Oh, God, my claustrophobia is setting in.
"
,,
4,7,"It's all right. It's okay. It's the fabric.
"
,,
4,7,"It's your clothes. Let's get your clothes off.
"
,,
4,7,"Peter, what's wrong with you? I am naked!
"
,,
4,7,"Oh, God, you're self-conscious. I'm sorry.
"
,,
4,7,"Here. You know what?
"
,,
4,7,"Look, Cleveland, look.
"
,,
4,7,"See? Now you're not alone, Cleveland.
"
,,
4,7,"Let me out of here!
"
,,
4,7,"I need to get out of here.
"
,,
4,7,"Cleveland, no, you're staying.
"
,,
4,7,"This is for your own good.
"
,,
4,7,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
4,7,"Hi, we're here for the interview.
"
,,
4,7,"Excuse me. Hi. Listen, I just wanted
"
,,
4,7,"to apologize for Peter.
"
,,
4,7,"He was just trying to help out his friend.
"
,,
4,7,"You see, his wife left him
"
,,
4,7,"and he's been kind of Ionely...
"
,,
4,7,"confused about what he really wants.
"
,,
4,7," What's your name?
"
,,
4,7," Brian.
"
,,
4,7,"Congratulations, Brian.
"
,,
4,7,"You're gonna be on <i>The Bachelorette.</i>
"
,,
4,7,"Really? You're sure
"
,,
4,7,"you don't want to reconsider my friend?
"
,,
4,7,"Let me see.
"
,,
4,7,"Oh, that ain't bad!
"
,,
4,7,"Brian, I can't believe
"
,,
4,7,"you're gonna be on <i>The Bachelorette.</i>
"
,,
4,7,"Yeah, I thought you said
"
,,
4,7,"those shows were stupid.
"
,,
4,7,"They are stupid.
"
,,
4,7,"But I figured I got a few days
"
,,
4,7,"of free booze and food...
"
,,
4,7,"before they kick me off.
"
,,
4,7,"I could use a vacation.
"
,,
4,7,"Oh, yeah, because you've got
"
,,
4,7,"such a heavy workload around here.
"
,,
4,7,"How you coming on that novel
"
,,
4,7,"you're working on, huh?
"
,,
4,7,"Got a big stack of papers there?
"
,,
4,7,"Got a nice little story
"
,,
4,7,"you working on there?
"
,,
4,7,"The big novel you've been working on
"
,,
4,7,"for three years, huh?
"
,,
4,7,"Got a compelling protagonist?
"
,,
4,7,"Got an obstacle for him to overcome?
"
,,
4,7,"Little story brewing there? Working on?
"
,,
4,7,"Working on that for quite some time, huh?
"
,,
4,7,"Talking about that three years ago.
"
,,
4,7,"Been working on that the whole time?
"
,,
4,7,"Nice little narrative.
"
,,
4,7,"Beginning, middle, and end.
"
,,
4,7,"Some friends become enemies,
"
,,
4,7,"some enemies become friends?
"
,,
4,7,"At the end your main character
"
,,
4,7,"is richer for the experience? Yeah?
"
,,
4,7,"No, you deserve some time off.
"
,,
4,7,"I am super excited.
"
,,
4,7,"You think she'll be hot?
"
,,
4,7," I bet she'll be hot.
"
,,
4,7," I think she'll be hot, too.
"
,,
4,7,"No way! So do I!
"
,,
4,7," Quagmire.
"
,,
4,7," Hey, Brian!
"
,,
4,7," How did you get on the show?
"
,,
4,7," I had to do a few favors.
"
,,
4,7,"I got to get on that show.
"
,,
4,7,"Come on, I'll do anything.
"
,,
4,7,"Anything?
"
,,
4,7," Yeah.
"
,,
4,7," All right.
"
,,
4,7," Okay, you're ready?
"
,,
4,7," Yep.
"
,,
4,7,"Okay, check under the bed.
"
,,
4,7," No, nothing.
"
,,
4,7," Check in the closet.
"
,,
4,7,"No, no monsters in here.
"
,,
4,7,"Now check the bathroom.
"
,,
4,7," No, none in here, either.
"
,,
4,7," Okay, good.
"
,,
4,7," So, can I be on <i>The Bachelorette?</i>
"
,,
4,7," Yeah. Goodnight.
"
,,
4,7,"Peter, I'm getting
"
,,
4,7,"a little worried about Chris.
"
,,
4,7,"All he does lately is sit alone in his room
"
,,
4,7,"talking to that zit.
"
,,
4,7,"Relax, Lois. What's a zit gonna do?
"
,,
4,7,"Talk to him and tell him to
"
,,
4,7,"sneak out of the house and cause trouble?
"
,,
4,7,"Now light it, ring the doorbell,
"
,,
4,7,"and run like hell!
"
,,
4,7," I don't know about this, Doug.
"
,,
4,7," Just do it!
"
,,
4,7,"Oh, good Lord!
"
,,
4,7,"Is that... Doody!
"
,,
4,7,"I'm doing the dishes, Joe.
"
,,
4,7,"I'll change you in a minute.
"
,,
4,7,"Trevor, this is Brooke, the bachelorette.
"
,,
4,7,"I wasn't too nervous.
"
,,
4,7,"When I am nervous I work out.
"
,,
4,7,"I wasn't working out,
"
,,
4,7,"so I must not have been nervous.
"
,,
4,7,"I was very pleased and surprised.
"
,,
4,7,"I really was not expecting an open bar.
"
,,
4,7,"Top-shelf booze, I tell you.
"
,,
4,7,"And this guy knew his stuff.
"
,,
4,7,"Made me a Mojito.
"
,,
4,7,"I don't think it's a gay drink.
"
,,
4,7,"Mojito!
"
,,
4,7,"Hey, guys.
"
,,
4,7,"Well, it's been great to meet you all.
"
,,
4,7,"And I am looking forward
"
,,
4,7,"to getting to know you while we're here.
"
,,
4,7," Dude, put your pants on.
"
,,
4,7," Shut up.
"
,,
4,7,"Well, I really like all the guys.
"
,,
4,7,"But some of them
"
,,
4,7,"seem a little too competitive.
"
,,
4,7,"I got to tell you. I don't know what she
"
,,
4,7,"would possibly see in Count Chocula.
"
,,
4,7,"I think he's just here
"
,,
4,7,"because he's a minority.
"
,,
4,7,"You were right, Doug. Mischief is fun.
"
,,
4,7,"We're the best pals since the Snorks.
"
,,
4,7,"I am having a really great time.
"
,,
4,7,"Me, too. I really value our friendship.
"
,,
4,7,"You're not like those other Snorks
"
,,
4,7,"who only want one thing.
"
,,
4,7,"Oh, that was clumsy. Hang on a second.
"
,,
4,7,"Gentlemen, it's time
"
,,
4,7,"for the first rose ceremony.
"
,,
4,7,"Who gets to stay,
"
,,
4,7,"and who takes the bus ride home...
"
,,
4,7,"it's up to Brooke.
"
,,
4,7," Trevor.
"
,,
4,7," That's what Trevor's talking about.
"
,,
4,7,"Hey, can I say hi to a friend of mine?
"
,,
4,7," Sure.
"
,,
4,7," Hi, Jesus!
"
,,
4,7,"No way!
"
,,
4,7,"[Phone ringing]
"
,,
4,7,"Hello. I know. I saw.
"
,,
4,7,"Glenn.
"
,,
4,7," Brian.
"
,,
4,7," What? Are you serious?
"
,,
4,7,"I feel like I didn't get to know you at all.
"
,,
4,7," Would you accept this rose?
"
,,
4,7," All right.
"
,,
4,7,"But I think this whole thing is about
"
,,
4,7,"as pointless as Peter's cow-kite.
"
,,
4,7,"This is never gonna work. Damn cow.
"
,,
4,7,"Cleveland, what am I doing wrong?
"
,,
4,7,"You got to get her running
"
,,
4,7,"before you start running.
"
,,
4,7,"Chris.
"
,,
4,7,"Chris, honey, can I talk to you?
"
,,
4,7,"Oh, my God, he's gone!
"
,,
4,7,"That means this room is mine now.
"
,,
4,7,"I am gonna party my ass off in here.
"
,,
4,7,"Great pot, Stewie.
"
,,
4,7,"Yeah, I got it from
"
,,
4,7,"our cleaning lady's boyfriend.
"
,,
4,7,"It's okay, though, 'cause she's gonna
"
,,
4,7,"use the money to get a mammogram.
"
,,
4,7,"Chris, where have you been?
"
,,
4,7,"Doug told me I don't need to listen to you.
"
,,
4,7,"Doug? Your pimple? Oh, that is it!
"
,,
4,7,"First thing tomorrow, we're going down
"
,,
4,7,"to Goldman's Pharmacy...
"
,,
4,7,"and get some astringent
"
,,
4,7,"to get rid of that thing.
"
,,
4,7,"What did I tell you?
"
,,
4,7,"She's trying to drive us apart.
"
,,
4,7,"We can't let that happen.
"
,,
4,7,"I am in no mood.
"
,,
4,7,"Welcome to the Saddleback Ranch
"
,,
4,7,"and our first group date.
"
,,
4,7,"Is everyone ready
"
,,
4,7,"for a little cowboy action?
"
,,
4,7," Yeah!
"
,,
4,7," I love horses.
"
,,
4,7,"Sorry, I am late, Brian. Here's your ride.
"
,,
4,7,"Oh, come on, you can't expect me
"
,,
4,7,"to ride that thing.
"
,,
4,7,"Sorry, we're short on horses.
"
,,
4,7,"You know what? Forget it.
"
,,
4,7,"I'll just go smoke.
"
,,
4,7," Hey, there, Adam.
"
,,
4,7," Hello, Henry.
"
,,
4,7,"I have the power!
"
,,
4,7,"Brooke, what are you doing here?
"
,,
4,7,"Oh, I just can't take it anymore.
"
,,
4,7,"All these guys just coming on to me.
"
,,
4,7,"I had to sneak off.
"
,,
4,7,"Oh, could I bum one of those?
"
,,
4,7,"You know, I don't even know
"
,,
4,7,"why I agreed to do this show.
"
,,
4,7,"This is just so not me.
"
,,
4,7,"I'd much rather just be home
"
,,
4,7,"listening to my old jazz records.
"
,,
4,7,"Really? I didn't know. I actually have
"
,,
4,7,"quite a jazz collection myself.
"
,,
4,7," What do you like?
"
,,
4,7," DJ Jazzy Jeff!
"
,,
4,7,"I'm kidding!
"
,,
4,7,"Oh, you got me. Oh, you got me, yeah.
"
,,
4,7,"No, I really like Coleman Hawkins,
"
,,
4,7,"Ben Webster.
"
,,
4,7,"Oh, and early Coltrane,
"
,,
4,7,"before he got clean.
"
,,
4,7,"Yeah, no junk, no soul.
"
,,
4,7,"No kidding. I mean, look at Chevy Chase.
"
,,
4,7,"Right.
"
,,
4,7,"You know, I got to say, I thought
"
,,
4,7,"she was just some actress...
"
,,
4,7,"Iooking for her 15 minutes of fame,
"
,,
4,7,"but she's pretty sharp, you know.
"
,,
4,7,"I guess you can't judge
"
,,
4,7,"a Brooke by her cover.
"
,,
4,7,"You can cut that out, right?
"
,,
4,7,"And maybe you can cut out when I said
"
,,
4,7,"junk earlier, the whole Chevy Chase thing.
"
,,
4,7,"Seems like he's probably
"
,,
4,7,"the kind of guy who might sue.
"
,,
4,7,"I mean, the guy's got to have
"
,,
4,7,"no money left.
"
,,
4,7,"All right, gentlemen...
"
,,
4,7,"let's see how Glenn's
"
,,
4,7,"private date with Brooke is going.
"
,,
4,7,"Hey, Brooke, what do you say,
"
,,
4,7,"we get you some more champagne?
"
,,
4,7,"Sure.
"
,,
4,7,"All right.
"
,,
4,7,"Hey, forgot about you guys.
"
,,
4,7,"Well, I guess the date's over.
"
,,
4,7,"Goodnight, Brooke.
"
,,
4,7,"Thanks for a lovely evening.
"
,,
4,7,"[Glenn sniffing]
"
,,
4,7,"[Glenn exclaiming in delight]
"
,,
4,7,"Oh, my God, Peter,
"
,,
4,7,"it looks like there's been a break in.
"
,,
4,7,"Do you think so?
"
,,
4,7,"Oh, God, they're back.
"
,,
4,7,"Whoa, awesome! Totally awesome!
"
,,
4,7,"All right, Goldman.
"
,,
4,7,"What the hell is your problem, Mort?
"
,,
4,7,"I am sorry, Peter. I thought you were
"
,,
4,7,"one of those criminals...
"
,,
4,7,"who broke in and destroyed
"
,,
4,7,"my entire stock of acne medication.
"
,,
4,7,"Oh, my God. Peter, do you think
"
,,
4,7,"Chris might have done this?
"
,,
4,7,"Come on, Lois, he doesn't have the wild
"
,,
4,7,"streak you had when you were younger.
"
,,
4,7,"For God's sake, you used to make
"
,,
4,7,"Plasto molds of celebrity body parts.
"
,,
4,7,"Okay, Daryl, it's almost dry.
"
,,
4,7,"Very nice, by the way.
"
,,
4,7,"This one's going on the shelf
"
,,
4,7,"right next to Dan Fogelberg.
"
,,
4,7,"Hey, Lois, am I up next?
"
,,
4,7,"Just wait in your dressing room.
"
,,
4,7,"I'll come back for you, Oates.
"
,,
4,7,"I am not coming back for Oates.
"
,,
4,7,"Glenn, will you accept this rose?
"
,,
4,7,"Really? After I drugged you...
"
,,
4,7,"and tried to have sex
"
,,
4,7,"with your unconscious body?
"
,,
4,7," What?
"
,,
4,7," Yes.
"
,,
4,7,"This is the final rose tonight.
"
,,
4,7," Brian.
"
,,
4,7," Yes!
"
,,
4,7,"Yeah, I mean,
"
,,
4,7,"I know I was skeptical at first...
"
,,
4,7,"but I got to be honest, I've never
"
,,
4,7,"felt this way about anyone before.
"
,,
4,7,"I mean, I am in love. That's it.
"
,,
4,7,"I am in love.
"
,,
4,7,"I finally understand
"
,,
4,7,"those songs on the radio.
"
,,
4,7,"[Singing] <i>What did you think</i>
"
,,
4,7,"Brooke has narrowed her choice down
"
,,
4,7,"to Quagmire and Brian.
"
,,
4,7,"All that's left is for Brooke
"
,,
4,7,"to meet their families.
"
,,
4,7,"Hey, Brian, I can't wait
"
,,
4,7,"to meet your family.
"
,,
4,7,"Yeah, me, too. They're pretty great.
"
,,
4,7,"Brian, welcome home, you son of a bitch!
"
,,
4,7,"So, did you loose?
"
,,
4,7,"You got to tell me all about it.
"
,,
4,7,"Hey, how was your bachelorette?
"
,,
4,7,"Was she a dumb bimbo like you said
"
,,
4,7,"but with a big rack.
"
,,
4,7,"Come on in and tell me everything.
"
,,
4,7,"I bet your stories will make me laugh
"
,,
4,7,"so hard, I'll shoot milk out of my nose.
"
,,
4,7,"Peter, this is Brooke, the bachelorette.
"
,,
4,7,"She's having dinner with us tonight.
"
,,
4,7,"I went over this with you
"
,,
4,7,"a few minutes ago.
"
,,
4,7,"Why, it's wonderful to meet you.
"
,,
4,7,"We've heard so many nice things.
"
,,
4,7,"Yes, indeed.
"
,,
4,7,"So, how long have you been a prostitute?
"
,,
4,7,"No, Doug, I will not lift up her shirt.
"
,,
4,7,"Chris, we have company.
"
,,
4,7,"So, you ever been with a woman?
"
,,
4,7,"No.
"
,,
4,7," Peter!
"
,,
4,7," What?
"
,,
4,7,"There. Are you happy, Doug?
"
,,
4,7,"Christopher Cross Griffin,
"
,,
4,7,"what are you doing?
"
,,
4,7,"Joe, what are you doing here?
"
,,
4,7,"Peter, we have proof that it was Chris
"
,,
4,7,"who vandalized Goldman's Pharmacy.
"
,,
4,7,"I knew it.
"
,,
4,7,"I didn't want to believe it, but it's true.
"
,,
4,7,"Oh, God, what happened to my baby.
"
,,
4,7,"Who sold you the drugs?
"
,,
4,7,"I can't believe this!
"
,,
4,7,"[AII arguing]
"
,,
4,7,"...what a cavity search is.
"
,,
4,7,"You made my mom cry tonight, Doug.
"
,,
4,7,"I don't think you're a very good friend.
"
,,
4,7,"I am not gonna listen to you anymore.
"
,,
4,7,"Oh, yeah? I'm inside your head now, fatty.
"
,,
4,7,"And I just might reach into your brain
"
,,
4,7,"and do this.
"
,,
4,7,"Okay, I'll listen.
"
,,
4,7,"[Laughing]
"
,,
4,7,"That's my boy.
"
,,
4,7,"Now, grab my bacon grease
"
,,
4,7,"and slather me up some homeys.
"
,,
4,7," What's going on, man?
"
,,
4,7," Wassup, dog.
"
,,
4,7,"Yeah, where are all the whiteheads at?
"
,,
4,7,"Brian, we've had some wonderful times.
"
,,
4,7,"I really like you.
"
,,
4,7,"Look, I understand. It's okay.
"
,,
4,7,"I hope you and Quagmire
"
,,
4,7,"have all the happiness in the world.
"
,,
4,7,"But I am choosing you.
"
,,
4,7,"Just promise me
"
,,
4,7,"you'll make him wear this... What?
"
,,
4,7,"You're choosing me?
"
,,
4,7,"After what happened with my family?
"
,,
4,7,"Well, it wasn't as bad as the evening
"
,,
4,7,"I spent with Glenn and his mother.
"
,,
4,7,"Glenn, would you feed Mittens?
"
,,
4,7,"Mittens has food in his bowl.
"
,,
4,7,"That's old food!
"
,,
4,7,"Mittens, shut up!
"
,,
4,7,"Don't you talk to Mittens that way.
"
,,
4,7,"Mittens is a member of this family.
"
,,
4,7,"Mom, you want this three-way to happen,
"
,,
4,7,"you're gonna have to change your tone.
"
,,
4,7,"My God, you've just made me
"
,,
4,7,"the happiest dog in the world.
"
,,
4,7," I love you, Brooke.
"
,,
4,7," I love you, too, Brian.
"
,,
4,7,"All right, that's a wrap.
"
,,
4,7,"Well, it was great working with you, Brian.
"
,,
4,7,"Good luck.
"
,,
4,7,"What are you talking about?
"
,,
4,7,"What about us?
"
,,
4,7,"Oh, stop it. It's just TV.
"
,,
4,7," Hi, Brian.
"
,,
4,7," Michael Eisner?
"
,,
4,7,"On behalf of ABC,
"
,,
4,7,"I'd like to give you this parting gift.
"
,,
4,7,"A bill for the mansion.
"
,,
4,7,"No givesies-backsies!
"
,,
4,7,"Hey, Brooke, it's me again, Brian.
"
,,
4,7,"Hi. Wasn't sure
"
,,
4,7,"if you got my last message...
"
,,
4,7,"or any of the other ones.
"
,,
4,7,"Anyway, I'll just leave a quick message...
"
,,
4,7,"'cause you might be trying
"
,,
4,7,"to call me right now.
"
,,
4,7,"And I don't want to tie up the line.
"
,,
4,7,"So, I guess...
"
,,
4,7,"I guess... Yeah, give me a call.
"
,,
4,7,"Okay, I'm hanging up...
"
,,
4,7,"in three, two, one.
"
,,
4,7,"Okay, call me back.
"
,,
4,7,"I'll be here all day, and tonight.
"
,,
4,7,"Okay, bye.
"
,,
4,7,"Hey, me again. Thought I might've
"
,,
4,7,"heard a voice when I was hanging up.
"
,,
4,7,"Nope? I guess not.
"
,,
4,7,"Okay, I will talk to you soon.
"
,,
4,7,"Hello? No. Sorry.
"
,,
4,7,"Hey, babe. Just trying you again.
"
,,
4,7,"Listening to our guy Coltrane,
"
,,
4,7,"you know. Okay.
"
,,
4,7,"Anyway, I got a fax earlier
"
,,
4,7,"about cheap airfare to Cancun.
"
,,
4,7,"Didn't know if that was you
"
,,
4,7,"trying to reach me.
"
,,
4,7,"Let me give you my home number again
"
,,
4,7,"just in case you lost it.
"
,,
4,7," Damn.
"
,,
4,7,"[Doorbell ringing]
"
,,
4,7," Package for Brooke Roberts.
"
,,
4,7," Oh, that's me. Thanks.
"
,,
4,7,"BRIAN: <i>Hey, there. Me again.</i>
"
,,
4,7,"Hey, you're home.
"
,,
4,7,"Listen, Brian, I want you
"
,,
4,7,"to leave me alone, or I'm calling the cops.
"
,,
4,7,"[Singing] <i>Brooke, I'm so in love with you</i>
"
,,
4,7,"Chris, where the hell are we?
"
,,
4,7,"I told you, Doug, this is the bacon factory.
"
,,
4,7,"Doctor, I need you to get rid of this zit.
"
,,
4,7," You traitor!
"
,,
4,7," That's a doozy.
"
,,
4,7,"I bet some of those awful kids at school
"
,,
4,7,"call you zit-face.
"
,,
4,7," No.
"
,,
4,7," Pop-a-zit.
"
,,
4,7," No.
"
,,
4,7," Puspeak.
"
,,
4,7," No.
"
,,
4,7," Fat ass?
"
,,
4,7," Yeah.
"
,,
4,7," That's terrible.
"
,,
4,7,"We're gonna have to use
"
,,
4,7,"some cortisone on that.
"
,,
4,7,"Oh, yeah? Two can play at that game.
"
,,
4,7,"Don't think I won't do it, man.
"
,,
4,7,"All right, let's all be cool here.
"
,,
4,7,"No!
"
,,
4,7,"You okay, fat ass?
"
,,
4,7,"She told me she loved me
"
,,
4,7,"on what used to be a hit TV show.
"
,,
4,7,"I can't believe I got sucked into
"
,,
4,7,"that phony reality world...
"
,,
4,7,"just like everyone else.
"
,,
4,7,"I became the very thing I was mocking.
"
,,
4,7,"I know it hurts now, Brian,
"
,,
4,7,"but look at the bright side.
"
,,
4,7,"You have some new material
"
,,
4,7,"for that novel you've been writing.
"
,,
4,7,"You know, the novel
"
,,
4,7,"you've been working on.
"
,,
4,7,"You know, the one
"
,,
4,7,"you've been working on for three years.
"
,,
4,7,"You know, the novel.
"
,,
4,7,"You got something new
"
,,
4,7,"to write about now, you know.
"
,,
4,7,"Maybe a main character
"
,,
4,7,"gets into a relationship...
"
,,
4,7,"then suffers a little heartbreak.
"
,,
4,7,"Something like
"
,,
4,7,"what you've just been through.
"
,,
4,7,"Draw from a real-life experience.
"
,,
4,7,"Little heartbreak, you know,
"
,,
4,7,"work it into the story.
"
,,
4,7,"Make those characters
"
,,
4,7,"a little more three-dimensional.
"
,,
4,7,"A little richer experience for the reader.
"
,,
4,7,"Make those second hundred pages...
"
,,
4,7,"really keep the reader guessing
"
,,
4,7,"what's going to happen.
"
,,
4,7,"Some twists and turns. Little epilogue.
"
,,
4,7,"Everybody learns the hero's journey
"
,,
4,7,"isn't always a happy one.
"
,,
4,7,"Yeah, I look forward to reading it.
"
,,
4,8,"Thanks for baby-sitting, Meg.
"
,,
4,8,"We'll be back in a couple of hours.
"
,,
4,8,"I don't understand why
"
,,
4,8,"I have to baby-sit Stewie.
"
,,
4,8,"I mean, what's he really gonna do
"
,,
4,8,"if we leave him by himself?
"
,,
4,8,"And now to test my teleportation pods.
"
,,
4,8,"Oh, damn!
"
,,
4,8,"I'm a monster!
"
,,
4,8,"[Singing] <i>It seems today that all you see</i>
"
,,
4,8,"So, this is awkward, but...
"
,,
4,8,"have we ever actually, you know, met?
"
,,
4,8,"I mean, you know, I don't even know, say,
"
,,
4,8,"for example, if you have a room up there.
"
,,
4,8,"You know, a room?
"
,,
4,8,"I have a room.
"
,,
4,8,"You know, Meg, if you kill yourself now...
"
,,
4,8,"you'll probably get a full page
"
,,
4,8,"in the yearbook.
"
,,
4,8,"So, you know,
"
,,
4,8,"that's something to think about.
"
,,
4,8,"Just burped.
"
,,
4,8,"[Doorbell rings]
"
,,
4,8,"Hi, Meg.
"
,,
4,8,"You busy Saturday night?
"
,,
4,8,"Neil, you ask me out, like, once a day,
"
,,
4,8,"and I always give you the same answer.
"
,,
4,8,"No!
"
,,
4,8,"God, I don't think I could have been any
"
,,
4,8,"clearer the last time I turned him down.
"
,,
4,8,"[Jazzy instrumental music]
"
,,
4,8,"Hey, Mort.
"
,,
4,8,"Lois and I are out on our date night.
"
,,
4,8,"Why don't you give me some condoms?
"
,,
4,8,"And some Excedrin.
"
,,
4,8,"My wife's got a headache this big.
"
,,
4,8,"You know, it's like from the commercial.
"
,,
4,8,"This big. Only it's my junk.
"
,,
4,8,"All right, then. $12.43.
"
,,
4,8,"Jeez, that's more of a rip-off
"
,,
4,8,"than that breakfast machine I bought.
"
,,
4,8,"Ow! Ow!
"
,,
4,8,"What was the point of all that?
"
,,
4,8,"All it does is shoot you.
"
,,
4,8,"It doesn't make breakfast at all.
"
,,
4,8,"Besides, I forgot my wallet.
"
,,
4,8,"Well, that's okay. I'll just open up a tab.
"
,,
4,8,"Wait a minute, what the hell's a tab?
"
,,
4,8,"Does that mean I don't gotta pay?
"
,,
4,8," Well, not right now, but...
"
,,
4,8," Ah, sweet!
"

4,8,"Hey, while I'm at it,
"
,,
4,8,"give me all these copies of <i>Marie Claire.</i>
"
,,
4,8,"You know, in case I want to
"
,,
4,8,"rub out that easy one...
"
,,
4,8,"before I get Lois into bed tonight.
"
,,
4,8,"Kathleen Turner's on Page 45.
"
,,
4,8,"Kathleen Turner, huh?
"
,,
4,8,"Let's see how she looks.
"
,,
4,8,"Oh, that's a shame.
"

4,8,"COMMENTATOR: [On TV] <i>And now back to</i>

"
,,
4,8,"STEWIE: Meg!
"
,,
4,8,"Meg, I'm hungry!
"
,,
4,8,"There's a granola bar in the cupboard.
"
,,
4,8,"I want it.
"
,,
4,8,"Hey.
"
,,
4,8,"Hey.
"
,,
4,8,"What's this?
"
,,
4,8,"What's going on?
"
,,
4,8,"Am I talking to myself up there?
"
,,
4,8,"Oh, my God.
"
,,
4,8,"Stewie, just shut up and go to bed!
"
,,
4,8,"Do you know what I do, Meg?
"
,,
4,8,"I spit in your mouth while you sleep.
"
,,
4,8,"Finally. Look, Mom, I've had it.
"
,,
4,8,"I am not baby-sitting anymore.
"
,,
4,8,"It's Saturday night,
"
,,
4,8,"I could be out having a life.
"
,,
4,8,"Meg, if you don't want
"
,,
4,8,"to baby-sit anymore, that's fine.
"
,,
4,8,"But don't you stand there and lie to me.
"
,,
4,8,"Meg, she torched your ass, man.
"
,,
4,8,"She torched your ass.
"
,,
4,8,"Why can't you just hire a real baby-sitter?
"
,,
4,8,"Well, I guess we could do that.
"
,,
4,8,"Damn! I'm terrible at meeting new people.
"
,,
4,8,"Like the time I was on <i>Blind Date.</i>
"
,,
4,8," I'm having a great time, Stewie.
"
,,
4,8," Me, too.
"
,,
4,8,"So, you ready to go grab some 'za?
"
,,
4,8,"Yeah.
"
,,
4,8,"So, a wild guess here...
"
,,
4,8,"but from the looks of your arm hair,
"
,,
4,8,"I'm guessing you're Italian?
"
,,
4,8,"All right, you guys, I got eight crates
"
,,
4,8,"of ipecac from Mort, all on my tab.
"
,,
4,8,"Now, whoever goes the longest
"
,,
4,8,"without puking...
"
,,
4,8,"gets the last piece of pie in the fridge.
"
,,
4,8,"Okay, here we go.
"
,,
4,8," How's everybody doing?
"
,,
4,8," Good. Good so far.
"
,,
4,8,"All right, all right.
"
,,
4,8," Nothing yet.
"
,,
4,8," Cool, cool.
"
,,
4,8,"You know, I don't know if you guys
"
,,
4,8,"had any of that pie already...
"
,,
4,8,"but that is some tasty stuff.
"
,,
4,8,"That's from the bake sale that Lois...
"
,,
4,8,"One down. I know somebody
"
,,
4,8,"who won't be having any...
"
,,
4,8,"I'm starting to feel funny.
"
,,
4,8,"Well, I feel fine. I guess I'm...
"
,,
4,8,"Oh, boy! That means I win. I get to eat...
"
,,
4,8,"Oh, God! Why didn't anybody tell me...
"
,,
4,8,"Oh, my God! My insides are on...
"
,,
4,8,"No. No, please. No more, no more. No...
"

4,8,"Dad, I'm scared.

4,8,"Get the phone. Call 911...
"

4,8,"Lois! Lois! Lois, get in here...
"
,,
4,8,"Okay, okay. I think it's all gone.
"
,,
4,8,"I think...

4,8,"I don't wanna, I don't wanna...

4,8,"Hey, Meg, you better check this out.
"
,,
4,8,"[Airplane roaring]
"
,,
4,8,"Oh, God, this is so embarrassing.
"
,,
4,8,"I can't believe this is happening to me.
"
,,
4,8,"Looks like someone could use
"
,,
4,8,"a greeting card to cheer them up.
"
,,
4,8,"I put these on my tab.
"
,,
4,8,"Here, take a <i>Far Side</i> one.
"
,,
4,8,"The vulture thinks he's a cowboy.
"
,,
4,8,"It's kind of funny.

4,8,"Hey, Peter, you got a card for
"
,,
4,8,"if you transferred VD to somebody?
"
,,
4,8,"Let's see here.
"
,,
4,8,"Yup. ""Sorry I accidentally gave you VD.""
"
,,
4,8,"That's all you got is accidental, huh?
"
,,
4,8,"All right, I'll take it.
"
,,
4,8,"Well, first let me thank you
"
,,
4,8,"for answering the ad.
"
,,
4,8,"Now, what do you feel qualifies you
"
,,
4,8,"to be an effective baby-sitter for Stewie?
"
,,
4,8,"[Speaking in Portuguese]
"
,,
4,8,"Yeah. We couldn't run an ad
"
,,
4,8,"that said ""no Portuguese,"" but...
"
,,
4,8,"no Portuguese.
"
,,
4,8,"So, I see here you worked for a family

,,
4,8,"for a number of years.
"
,,
4,8,"Can I call the Herculoids for a reference?
"
,,
4,8,"[Babbling]
"

4,8,"I'm sorry, I don't understand.
"

4,8,"The position has been filled.
"

4,8,"The position has been filled.
"

4,8,"Thank you very much. You can go now.
"
,,
4,8,"[Babbling angrily]
"
,,
4,8,"Leave! Now!
"
,,
4,8,"I didn't think it was gonna be this hard
"
,,
4,8,"to choose a baby-sitter.
"
,,
4,8,"Yes, if only you were this discerning...
"
,,
4,8,"when you picked that happening

4,8,"Bruce Jenner hairdo.
"
,,
4,8,"Sorry I'm late. Can I still apply for the job?

,,
4,8,"[Romantic instrumental music]

"
,,
4,8,"Oh, no.
"

4,8,"Oh! Oh!

4,8,"Unbelievable! Oh, my God!
"
,,
4,8,"How lucky are we, huh?
"

4,8,"""Hey, Stewie,
"
,,
4,8,"what are you doing tonight?""
"
,,
4,8,"""Oh, nothing. Just watching

,,
4,8,"Hey, Mort, do these suppositories
"
,,
4,8,"come in other flavors?
"
,,
4,8,"Peter, are you eating those?
"
,,
4,8,"No, I'm shoving them up my butt.
"
,,
4,8,"Of course I'm eating them.
"
,,
4,8,"Give me a carton.
"
,,
4,8,"Peter, it's the end of the month,
"
,,
4,8,"and I'm calling your tab.
"
,,
4,8," You owe me $34,000.
"
,,
4,8," What?
"
,,
4,8,"Oh, man, how am I gonna come up
"
,,
4,8,"with that kind of money?
"
,,
4,8,"Peter, I'm waiting.
"
,,
4,8,"All right, all right.
"
,,
4,8,"Listen, I got another idea.
"
,,
4,8,"What if I sold you my daughter?
"
,,
4,8,"You drop the tab,
"
,,
4,8,"and your son can have Meg.
"
,,
4,8,"MEG: What?
"
,,
4,8,"Yep, all you gotta do is sign this contract.
"
,,
4,8,"Are you out of your mind?
"
,,
4,8,"You can't sell me, you fat son of a bitch!
"
,,
4,8,"Whoa! Careful getting this fish
"
,,
4,8,"off the hook, Mort.
"
,,
4,8,"She's got some fangs.
"
,,
4,8,"What do you think of that, Neil?
"
,,
4,8,"Daddy bought you a girlfriend.
"
,,
4,8,"Excuse me. If anybody is interested,
"
,,
4,8,"I already have a girlfriend.
"
,,
4,8,"There's no way... Wait, what?
"
,,
4,8,"You ready to go, honey?
"
,,
4,8,"You rejected me too many times, Meg.
"
,,
4,8,"I couldn't wait for you forever.
"
,,
4,8,"Besides, Cecilia thinks
"
,,
4,8,"my psoriasis is sexy.
"
,,
4,8,"I can't believe he's over me.
"
,,
4,8,"I can't believe I'm out $34,000.
"
,,
4,8,"I can't believe it's not butter.
"
,,
4,8,"Stick around. More <i>Family Guy</i> coming up.
"
,,
4,8,"Peter, how could you have tried
"
,,
4,8,"to sell our daughter?
"
,,
4,8,"All right, Lois, I don't want this to ruin
"
,,
4,8,"our date night, so I'll make it up to you.
"
,,
4,8,"Oh, Peter.
"
,,
4,8,"""I'm sorry I tried to sell our daughter.""
"
,,
4,8,"Yeah, you don't know how hard it was
"
,,
4,8,"to find one of those in English.
"
,,
4,8,"Tonight the baby-sitter comes, Rupert.
"
,,
4,8,"Lovely LaDawn.
"
,,
4,8,"Hey, LaDawn. Hey, what's going on?
"
,,
4,8,"How are you?
"
,,
4,8,"Yeah. Just me, Stewie.
"
,,
4,8,"Just being myself.
"
,,
4,8,"Yeah. Well, this here? It's just my package.
"
,,
4,8,"Just my package.
"
,,
4,8,"God delivered it, I signed for it.
"
,,
4,8,"World keeps on spinning. Yeah.
"
,,
4,8,"Oh, no!
"
,,
4,8,"Jenga, there it is.
"
,,
4,8,"Well, I guess that's why they call it Jenga.
"
,,
4,8,"Stewie, you're so cute,
"
,,
4,8,"I can't even stand it.
"
,,
4,8,"Thank you. I'm having a good time, too.
"
,,
4,8,"I hope I don't make any social <i>faux pas...</i>
"
,,
4,8,"like I did at Pamela and Tommy Lee's
"
,,
4,8,"dinner party.
"
,,
4,8,"Hi, sorry I'm late.
"
,,
4,8,"I was visiting my aunt in the hospital.
"
,,
4,8,"She has hepatitis.
"
,,
4,8,"Sorry.
"
,,
4,8,"CECILIA: Neil is such an amazing guy.
"
,,
4,8,"We just make
"
,,
4,8,"an absolutely perfect couple.
"
,,
4,8,"You know, Neil liked me first.
"
,,
4,8,"And I was gonna go out with him
"
,,
4,8,"when I was ready to settle for him.
"
,,
4,8,"Get your own spaz.
"
,,
4,8,"All right, ladies, enough chitchat.
"
,,
4,8,"Take it off, get in the shower
"
,,
4,8,"and bounce around for me.
"
,,
4,8,"Sweetie, your daddy and I
"
,,
4,8,"are going to the movies tonight.
"
,,
4,8,"How would you like LaDawn to baby-sit?
"
,,
4,8,"Yes! I'm going to wow her tonight, Rupert.
"
,,
4,8,"I'm gonna be cooler than Brian
"
,,
4,8,"when he hangs out at the bowling alley.
"
,,
4,8,"That's what I love about high-school girls.
"
,,
4,8,"I keep getting older,
"
,,
4,8,"they stay the same age.
"
,,
4,8,"Yes, they do. Yes, they do.
"
,,
4,8,"Please go out with me.
"
,,
4,8,"I'm just trying to make Neil jealous.
"
,,
4,8,"I promise, I'll pay and everything.
"
,,
4,8,"Yeah. That sounds cool,
"
,,
4,8,"but I'm gonna be in the hospital that night.
"
,,
4,8,"[Screaming in pain]
"
,,
4,8," Hi, gorgeous man.
"
,,
4,8," Oh, you.
"
,,
4,8,"Must I lock up your tongue
"
,,
4,8,"with the rest of the silver?
"
,,
4,8,"Stewie, this is Jeremy.
"
,,
4,8,"Hey, little man. So you're the guy
"
,,
4,8,"who's been trying to steal my girlfriend.
"
,,
4,8,"What... You...
"
,,
4,8,"Girlfriend?
"
,,
4,8,"What kind of sick, twisted game
"
,,
4,8,"are you playing at?
"
,,
4,8,"Stewie sounds a little cranky.
"
,,
4,8,"I'll put him to bed.
"
,,
4,8,"I got your hat! Take that, hatless!
"
,,
4,8,"Now go back to the quad
"
,,
4,8,"and resume your Hacky Sack tourney!
"
,,
4,8,"I'm not gonna lie down
"
,,
4,8,"for some frat-boy bastard...
"
,,
4,8,"with his damn Teva sandals
"
,,
4,8,"and his Skoal Bandits...
"
,,
4,8,"and his Abercrombie & Fitch
"
,,
4,8,"long-sleeved, open-stitched...
"
,,
4,8,"crew-neck Henley smoking his sticky buds
"
,,
4,8,"out of a soda can...
"
,,
4,8,"while watching his favorite downloaded
"
,,
4,8,"Yes, we all love Mr. Plow.
"
,,
4,8,"You've got the song memorized, do you?
"
,,
4,8,"So does everyone else!
"
,,
4,8,"That is exactly the kind of idiot you see
"
,,
4,8,"at Taco Bell at 1:00 in the morning.
"
,,
4,8,"The guy who just whiffed his way
"
,,
4,8,"down the bar-skank ladder.
"
,,
4,8,"Good night, Stewie.
"
,,
4,8,"If he wants to throw hands,
"
,,
4,8,"I'll throw hands.
"
,,
4,8,"I tell you...
"
,,
4,8,"Hey! Neil and Cecilia.
"
,,
4,8,"I didn't expect to see you here.
"
,,
4,8,"Meet Jake, my boyfriend.
"
,,
4,8,"I want some BB's.
"
,,
4,8,"My dad lets me shoot at cats.
"
,,
4,8,"Hi, Meg.
"
,,
4,8,"Neil and I are celebrating
"
,,
4,8,"our two-week anniversary.
"
,,
4,8,"It seems like only yesterday...
"
,,
4,8,"he was just a stranger
"
,,
4,8,"videotaping me through the window.
"
,,
4,8,"Big deal.
"
,,
4,8,"He did that to me three years ago.
"
,,
4,8,"And he gave me the tapes for Christmas.
"
,,
4,8,"He gave me DVDs.
"
,,
4,8,"The production values were amazing,
"
,,
4,8,"much better than <i>Kramer vs. Predator.</i>
"
,,
4,8,"You want him back?
"
,,
4,8,"You can't just disappear for three months
"
,,
4,8,"and then suddenly decide...
"
,,
4,8,"you want him back! You can't have him!
"
,,
4,8,"Well, I'm glad Neil's over me, anyway.
"
,,
4,8,"I'm with Jake now. Right, Jake?
"
,,
4,8,"Maybe someday we'll get married
"
,,
4,8,"and you can go up on me.
"
,,
4,8," Neil, I wanna be your girlfriend.
"
,,
4,8," What?
"
,,
4,8,"I was wrong to drive you away.
"
,,
4,8,"We belong together.
"
,,
4,8,"Of course, I'm understandably skeptical
"
,,
4,8,"of your newfound affection for me.
"
,,
4,8,"You still got that contract
"
,,
4,8,"our dads drew up?
"
,,
4,8,"Give me that.
"
,,
4,8," You wanna hook up?
"
,,
4,8," Buy me something.
"
,,
4,8,"I can't believe we're going out.
"
,,
4,8,"This is so cool.
"
,,
4,8,"Neil. Neil, not so fast.
"
,,
4,8,"Meg, you need to fulfill
"
,,
4,8,"your contractual obligations.
"
,,
4,8,"What are you talking about?
"
,,
4,8,"All right, Meg, according to the contract...
"
,,
4,8,"every night,
"
,,
4,8,"you have to put on my pajamas.
"
,,
4,8,"My mom's record is 12 seconds.
"
,,
4,8," Neil, I think you're old enough to...
"
,,
4,8," Go!
"
,,
4,8," Would you stop kicking? Just hold still.
"
,,
4,8," That's tickling. It tickles.
"
,,
4,8," My thumb.
"
,,
4,8," Hold still. Quit it...
"
,,
4,8,"LaDawn, I thought
"
,,
4,8,"we could watch a DVD together.
"
,,
4,8,"I picked up the first season
"
,,
4,8,"of <i>Jiminy Glick.</i>
"
,,
4,8,"Imagine being that guy for a day.
"
,,
4,8,"Colin Farrell, so I was talking
"
,,
4,8,"to my wife, Dixie, the other day...
"
,,
4,8,"and she was saying
"
,,
4,8,"that you weren't a very good actor.
"
,,
4,8,"And I agreed with her.
"
,,
4,8,"Now, why, Colin,
"
,,
4,8,"why would we both say that?
"
,,
4,8,"All right, that's it.
"
,,
4,8,"Jeremy must be destroyed.
"
,,
4,8,"Mom?
"
,,
4,8,"Dad?
"
,,
4,8,"Mom? Is anyone there?
"
,,
4,8,"Little man? You in here?
"
,,
4,8,"I say, I think this is how you change a tire.
"
,,
4,8,"But what do I know? I'm just a baby!
"
,,
4,8,"Here's your iPod, so you can listen
"
,,
4,8,"to The Streaks while you gasp for air.
"
,,
4,8,"[Mumbles]
"
,,
4,8,"The Strokes. Right.
"
,,
4,8,"Boy, this was a better acquisition
"
,,
4,8,"than I thought.
"
,,
4,8,"We may even be able to put in
"
,,
4,8,"some sorghum this year.
"
,,
4,8,"So, anyway...
"
,,
4,8,"Hey, I made you a mix tape.
"
,,
4,8,"I don't have a dual cassette player...
"
,,
4,8,"so, you know, I had to hold
"
,,
4,8,"the tape recorder up to the radio...
"
,,
4,8,"so the quality is kind of sucky...
"
,,
4,8,"but, you know,
"
,,
4,8,"all the songs describe my feelings.
"
,,
4,8,"I'm sorry, Stewie. I'm just upset.
"
,,
4,8,"Jeremy stopped calling me.
"
,,
4,8,"He what? That blaggard!
"
,,
4,8,"Come here,
"
,,
4,8,"let me just hold you for a while.
"
,,
4,8,"Stewie! No! That is a bad place to touch.
"
,,
4,8,"No. No, no, no, no, no, no.
"
,,
4,8,"But...
"
,,
4,8,"But I... You...
"
,,
4,8,"[Bawling]
"
,,
4,8,"No more TV.
"
,,
4,8,"Well, how about no more job?
"
,,
4,8,"You hear that, Miss Fussy Britches?
"
,,
4,8,"I shall see you fired, damn you!
"
,,
4,8,"I thought we were going to go all the way
"
,,
4,8,"and die together like Hitler and Eva Braun.
"
,,
4,8," We do everything together, <i>ja?</i>
"
,,
4,8,"You got your poison?
"
,,
4,8,"Okay. One, two, three.
"
,,
4,8," You didn't do it.
"
,,
4,8," You didn't do it, either.
"
,,
4,8,"Okay, okay.
"
,,
4,8,"This time we really have to do it.
"
,,
4,8," Okay, all right. You ready? Okay, okay.
"
,,
4,8," Okay.
"
,,
4,8," One, two.
"
,,
4,8," One, two.
"
,,
4,8,"You want me to kill myself
"
,,
4,8,"and you're not going to.
"
,,
4,8," You suck. You suck.
"
,,
4,8," You suck.
"
,,
4,8,"Hey, Stewie, there's something
"
,,
4,8,"thunking around in the trunk of my car...
"
,,
4,8,"and I can't get in there
"
,,
4,8,"'cause somebody busted the lock.
"
,,
4,8,"You have any idea what that's about?
"
,,
4,8,"That. It's this whole...
"
,,
4,8,"It's this whole crazy thing.
"
,,
4,8,"Hey, this is not a barn, young lady.
"
,,
4,8,"I'm just so exhausted.
"
,,
4,8,"You know, I thought I'd be happy
"
,,
4,8,"being with Neil, but I'm not.
"
,,
4,8,"This is horrible.
"
,,
4,8,"Sweetheart, we'll figure some way
"
,,
4,8,"to get you out of this.
"
,,
4,8,"Brian, did you find any loophole
"
,,
4,8,"in the contract?
"
,,
4,8,"Nope, it's airtight.
"
,,
4,8,"The only way out
"
,,
4,8,"is if Neil commits an infidelity.
"
,,
4,8,"Well, that's it then.
"
,,
4,8,"We got to find somebody to seduce Neil.
"
,,
4,8," Who, me?
"
,,
4,8," Well, if not you, Lois, then who?
"
,,
4,8,"Beverly D'Angelo?
"
,,
4,8,"'Cause I don't think she'd do it.
"
,,
4,8,"And I don't even know
"
,,
4,8,"how to get ahold of her.
"
,,
4,8,"Hello, LaDawn.
"
,,
4,8,"Listen, I certainly hope you'll excuse
"
,,
4,8,"last night's indiscretion.
"
,,
4,8,"It was just... Oh, my God, LaDawn!
"
,,
4,8,"What's that on your neck?
"
,,
4,8,"Lois! Thank God you're here, Lois.
"
,,
4,8,"It was all her friends.
"
,,
4,8,"They were doing marijuana and heroin.
"
,,
4,8,"And they were taking eczema
"
,,
4,8,"and touching each other.
"
,,
4,8," LaDawn, wake up this instant.
"
,,
4,8," What?
"
,,
4,8," I don't...
"
,,
4,8," You know what? Don't bother, LaDawn.
"
,,
4,8,"You are fired.
"
,,
4,8,"Well, I really don't know
"
,,
4,8,"how this happened...
"
,,
4,8,"but I guess this is the last time
"
,,
4,8,"I get to see you.
"
,,
4,8,"I'm gonna miss you, little guy.
"
,,
4,8,"This is for you.
"
,,
4,8,"She made me a mix tape.
"
,,
4,8,"Oh, dear God, what have I done?
"
,,
4,8,"I've made a terrible mistake.
"
,,
4,8,"LaDawn! LaDawn!
"
,,
4,8,"LaDawn!
"
,,
4,8,"All right, you all set, honey?
"
,,
4,8,"LOIS: I can't believe I'm doing this.
"
,,
4,8,"It's so disgusting.
"
,,
4,8,"But it's for my little girl.
"
,,
4,8,"Dad, how do you know Neil will show up?
"
,,
4,8,"Don't worry, Meg.
"
,,
4,8,"I sent him an invitation he couldn't refuse.
"
,,
4,8,"Strange. These conventions
"
,,
4,8,"usually have Segway parking.
"
,,
4,8,"Hello? Am I too late for the Q&A?
"
,,
4,8,"Yeah, but you're just in time for the T&A.
"
,,
4,8,"Mrs. Griffin, what are you...
"
,,
4,8,"You can call me Mystique.
"
,,
4,8,"Mrs. Griffin, this is wrong.
"
,,
4,8,"Well, well, well, look at this, Meg.
"
,,
4,8,"Your boyfriend is violating
"
,,
4,8,"both your contract and my wife.
"
,,
4,8,"Meg, I wasn't doing anything.
"
,,
4,8,"Mrs. Griffin was just... You're bending it.
"
,,
4,8,"I don't care.
"
,,
4,8,"You've nullified the contract. I'm free!
"
,,
4,8,"Free?
"
,,
4,8,"I don't understand, Meg.
"
,,
4,8,"You don't want to be my girlfriend?
"
,,
4,8,"Well, I thought I did.
"
,,
4,8,"But I guess I was just jealous.
"
,,
4,8,"I see.
"
,,
4,8,"Well, Meg, I want you to be with me
"
,,
4,8,"because you want to be with me...
"
,,
4,8,"not because you have to.
"
,,
4,8,"Thank you, Neil.
"
,,
4,8,"Cecilia, it's The Goldman.
"
,,
4,8,"How about we fire up the old Segway...
"
,,
4,8,"and find a nice quiet field
"
,,
4,8,"to do long division in?
"
,,
4,8,"I mean, a nice quiet field
"
,,
4,8,"in which to do long division. Sorry.
"
,,
4,8,"Sorry, everybody.
"
,,
4,8,"Okay, I'm on my way.
"
,,
4,8,"He's going back to Cecilia?
"
,,
4,8,"I can't believe I'm actually jealous.
"
,,
4,8,"I can't believe I actually touched him.
"
,,
4,8,"I still can't believe it's not butter.
"
,,
4,8,"Next week I run for mayor of Quahog.
"
,,
4,8,"Do I have what it takes?
"
,,
4,8,"We'll find out. Don't miss it.
"
,,
4,8,"Well, here we are again.
"
,,
4,8,"Another Saturday night with basic cable.
"
,,
4,8,"Yep.
"
,,
4,8,"I suppose neither of us
"
,,
4,8,"is really cut out for love, and we...
"
,,
4,8,"Oh, my God! Jeremy's still in the trunk!
"
,,
4,8,"Oh, God, how long has it been?
"
,,
4,8,"Let's see. Two weeks. Yep.
"
,,
4,8,"Yeah, he's dead.
"
,,
4,8,"Definitely dead.
"
,,
4,9,"[Singing] <i>It seems today that all you see</i>
"
,,
4,9,"Okay, now, don't wander too far, kids.
"
,,
4,9,"You know, more children get kidnapped
"
,,
4,9,"at the grocery store than anywhere else.
"
,,
4,9," Hey.
"
,,
4,9," You got me!
"
,,
4,9," Not quick enough.
"
,,
4,9," Not quick enough, no.
"
,,
4,9," No, I was close, though.
"
,,
4,9," You were close.
"
,,
4,9,"I'm gonna go get some oranges, Stewie.
"
,,
4,9,"Here, hold the rest of these bags
"
,,
4,9,"for Mommy.
"
,,
4,9,"What brilliant parenting, Lois.
"
,,
4,9,"Leave a tiny infant with a plastic bag.
"
,,
4,9,"You know, I might asphyxiate myself,
"
,,
4,9,"just to teach you a lesson.
"
,,
4,9,"Here I go, just like that boy from INXS.
"
,,
4,9,"I am going to do it.
"
,,
4,9,"Blast! Good Lord, Lois...
"
,,
4,9,"either I was a C-section
"
,,
4,9,"or you're Wonder Woman.
"
,,
4,9,"Chris, would you run and get some milk?
"
,,
4,9,"And be sure to take it from the back.
"
,,
4,9," Chris, where have you been?
"
,,
4,9," I don't know.
"
,,
4,9," $53.98.
"
,,
4,9," Oh no, I forgot to go to the bank.
"
,,
4,9,"I'm a little short.
"
,,
4,9,"I'll have to put the ham back.
"
,,
4,9,"You know, I got some candy in my van,
"
,,
4,9,"if your kid wants some.
"
,,
4,9,"Oh, great!
"
,,
4,9," Wait a second!
"
,,
4,9," You got me! You got me.
"
,,
4,9," I'll get him, though. I'll get him.
"
,,
4,9," I bet you will. I bet you will.
"
,,
4,9,"Is that ham? I thought you put that back.
"
,,
4,9,"Oh...
"
,,
4,9," No, I put the other ham back.
"
,,
4,9," I don't remember another ham.
"
,,
4,9,"Well, you were too busy
"
,,
4,9,"eyeballing that <i>Redbook...</i>
"
,,
4,9," with Glenn Close on the cover.
"
,,
4,9," Hey, she is a handsome woman.
"
,,
4,9,"Well, well! Look who's carrying a little
"
,,
4,9,"flame for Glenn Close. What a surprise!
"
,,
4,9,"Although it's not the first time
"
,,
4,9,"you've surprised me.
"
,,
4,9,"I have so much stuff to do today.
"
,,
4,9,"I have to do laundry,
"
,,
4,9,"then I have a piano lesson...
"
,,
4,9,"then I have to make dinner. I am so busy.
"
,,
4,9,"Better hurry.
"
,,
4,9,"Lois, I want my graham...
"
,,
4,9,"Oh.
"
,,
4,9," Hey.
"
,,
4,9," Hey.
"
,,
4,9,"Playing a little dress-up?
"
,,
4,9," Yeah.
"
,,
4,9," Yeah, good.
"
,,
4,9,"It's fun to pretend.
"
,,
4,9," So listen, if you see Lois tell her...
"
,,
4,9," Graham cracker.
"
,,
4,9,"Graham cracker, yes, yes. That's it.
"
,,
4,9,"All right, so...
"
,,
4,9,"I'm just gonna go out in the hallway
"
,,
4,9,"and throw up about something else.
"
,,
4,9,"This is cute.
"
,,
4,9,"Oh, my God.
"
,,
4,9,"[Laughing maniacally]
"
,,
4,9,"Oh, my God, that was such a rush.
"
,,
4,9,"Yeah. I'm alive!
"
,,
4,9," Thanks for having us over.
"
,,
4,9," Yeah, it's a wonderful dinner.
"
,,
4,9,"And on this beautiful new china.
"
,,
4,9,"You guys have a lot of new stuff.
"
,,
4,9," Yeah, Lois has been splurging her ass off.
"
,,
4,9," Yeah, she has.
"
,,
4,9,"You know, she bought me
"
,,
4,9,"something yesterday...
"
,,
4,9,"but I am not going to tell you what it is.
"
,,
4,9,"I want you to guess. Just close your eyes.
"
,,
4,9," It's a soccer horn.
"
,,
4,9," I know what it is!
"
,,
4,9,"Hey, is that an original Matisse?
"
,,
4,9,"Hey, Bonnie. Listen, why don't you stop
"
,,
4,9,"with the questions, huh?
"
,,
4,9,"You're ruining everyone's good time.
"
,,
4,9,"Like Peter did, when he used to entertain
"
,,
4,9,"terminally ill kids.
"
,,
4,9,"Hi there. How you all doing?
"
,,
4,9,"All right, so I'm at the DMV the other day.
"
,,
4,9,"Long lines. Long lines at the DMV.
"
,,
4,9,"But you'll find out all about that
"
,,
4,9,"when you get...
"
,,
4,9,"[Stammering]
"
,,
4,9,"Moving on. So I finally tried Viagra and...
"
,,
4,9,"[Boy groaning]
"
,,
4,9,"We got a joker in the audience there.
"
,,
4,9,"You got something
"
,,
4,9,"you want to say, there, Mr. Heckler?
"
,,
4,9,"Dying hurts.
"
,,
4,9,"Tell me about it.
"
,,
4,9,"So anyway, who hates flying?
"
,,
4,9,"[Brian clearing his throat]
"
,,
4,9," Brian, what are you doing here?
"
,,
4,9," I should ask you the same question.
"
,,
4,9,"Lois, you're in an auto parts store,
"
,,
4,9,"stealing mufflers.
"
,,
4,9,"This is worse than
"
,,
4,9,"that Winona Ryder thing.
"
,,
4,9,"Are you saying I am a klepto?
"
,,
4,9,"Actually, I was talking about
"
,,
4,9,"It is settled, May.
"
,,
4,9,"Our parents have consented...
"
,,
4,9,"and you and I are to be married
"
,,
4,9,"on the first warm, sunny day of spring.
"
,,
4,9,"That would be most good, Newland,
"
,,
4,9,"most good.
"
,,
4,9,"I am sorry, but she is just awful.
"
,,
4,9,"Is there any way...
"
,,
4,9,"I mean, can we add, like,
"
,,
4,9,"a topless scene, or something?
"
,,
4,9," Yeah.
"
,,
4,9," Really?
"
,,
4,9," Yeah.
"
,,
4,9," We can? Great. All right, we got a movie.
"
,,
4,9,"God, you're right, Brian,
"
,,
4,9,"I'm out of control...
"
,,
4,9,"but I don't know what to do.
"
,,
4,9,"I'm just hooked on the rush of shoplifting.
"
,,
4,9,"I haven't felt a thrill like this
"
,,
4,9,"in a long time.
"
,,
4,9,"Well, I think you've had enough thrills.
"
,,
4,9,"Why don't you just put everything back?
"
,,
4,9,"Okay, Brian.
"
,,
4,9,"You know, you really are a good friend.
"
,,
4,9,"Let me rub your belly.
"
,,
4,9,"[Brian moaning in ecstasy]
"
,,
4,9,"Put it back.
"
,,
4,9,"A Matisse painting?
"
,,
4,9,"Ha. Ha.
"
,,
4,9,"[Imitating a car]
"
,,
4,9,"Oh no, Rupert, we're out of gas.
"
,,
4,9,"We better ask directions at that creepy,
"
,,
4,9,"and possibly haunted, house.
"
,,
4,9,"A ghost! It's okay. It's okay.
"
,,
4,9,"We got away just in time.
"
,,
4,9,"All right, now,
"
,,
4,9,"is that everything you stole?
"
,,
4,9,"That's everything.
"
,,
4,9,"You know, you really should talk
"
,,
4,9,"to a therapist about this.
"
,,
4,9,"I mean, it really helped Peter out...
"
,,
4,9,"when he became obsessed
"
,,
4,9,"with that fantasy world of his.
"
,,
4,9,"Yeah!
"
,,
4,9," You're a little too heavy, buddy.
"
,,
4,9," Yeah!
"
,,
4,9," We're going down.
"
,,
4,9," Yeah!
"
,,
4,9,"Yeah.
"
,,
4,9,"You know, Lois, we're just lucky...
"
,,
4,9,"we got this under control
"
,,
4,9,"before the police caught onto you.
"
,,
4,9,"Hold it right there, Lois,
"
,,
4,9,"you are under arrest.
"
,,
4,9,"Oh, crap. All right, look, just take it easy,
"
,,
4,9,"Joe. All right, Lois will go peacefully.
"
,,
4,9,"Oh, my God, I am so embarrassed.
"
,,
4,9,"Let me just get my purse.
"
,,
4,9,"[Laughing maniacally]
"
,,
4,9,"Sucker!
"
,,
4,9,"Sorry, Lois. Regulations.
"
,,
4,9,"I can't give you any special treatment.
"
,,
4,9," It's okay, Joe, I understand.
"
,,
4,9," Shut up, maggot!
"
,,
4,9,"Your Honor, I am so sorry
"
,,
4,9,"for stealing all that stuff.
"
,,
4,9,"I just couldn't control myself.
"
,,
4,9,"Well, Mrs. Griffin,
"
,,
4,9,"considering this is your first offense...
"
,,
4,9,"I've decided to go lenient and...
"
,,
4,9,"Where the hell is my gavel?
"
,,
4,9,"[Giggling sheepishly]
"
,,
4,9,"Give me that.
"
,,
4,9,"I sentence you to two years
"
,,
4,9,"in the State Prison.
"
,,
4,9," Man, that is bogus.
"
,,
4,9," Order in the court!
"
,,
4,9,"Another outburst like that, Mr. Griffin,
"
,,
4,9,"and I'll extend the sentence.
"
,,
4,9," Okay, three years.
"
,,
4,9," That was a sneeze.
"
,,
4,9," Four years.
"
,,
4,9," I am sorry.
"
,,
4,9," Five years.
"
,,
4,9," You douchebag.
"
,,
4,9," All right, three years it is.
"
,,
4,9," Three years in prison?
"
,,
4,9,"Oh, my God, what have I done?
"
,,
4,9,"Oh, man, I haven't been this upset
"
,,
4,9,"since I watched <i>The Blob</i> on television.
"
,,
4,9,"Look out behind you, lady! It's the Blob!
"
,,
4,9,"I'll save you.
"
,,
4,9,"Here you go. Meet your new friends.
"
,,
4,9," Hi, I'm Lois.
"
,,
4,9," I'm Fisty, that's Stabby, and that's Balls.
"
,,
4,9," Pull up a chair, we're playing cards.
"
,,
4,9," Oh. Okay.
"
,,
4,9," So, are those biblical names?
"
,,
4,9," Yeah, Fisty is.
"
,,
4,9,"Boy, I sure miss Lois.
"
,,
4,9,"I wish she was here
"
,,
4,9,"to clean up all this stuff.
"
,,
4,9," Hey, what's this?
"
,,
4,9," Mustard.
"
,,
4,9,"Oh, that's right.
"
,,
4,9,"We had hot dogs last week.
"
,,
4,9," You gonna eat that?
"
,,
4,9," The mustard on your shoulder? No.
"
,,
4,9,"Kids, look! Look. A deer.
"
,,
4,9," Can we pet him?
"
,,
4,9," No, no. Just watch.
"
,,
4,9,"[Sighing]
"
,,
4,9,"Peter!
"
,,
4,9,"There's so much doody in here.
"
,,
4,9,"I can't take it any more.
"
,,
4,9,"I haven't eaten in four days...
"
,,
4,9,"'cause I just can't fit any more in there.
"
,,
4,9,"Help me.
"
,,
4,9,"Okay, now when we get
"
,,
4,9,"to your mother's cage, say hello...
"
,,
4,9,"but don't drag your ass,
"
,,
4,9,"'cause I want to go the reptile house.
"
,,
4,9," And we got to see those pandas.
"
,,
4,9," Peter, this isn't a zoo, it's a prison.
"
,,
4,9," Quagmire, what are you doing here?
"
,,
4,9," It's conjugal visit day.
"
,,
4,9,"You know, I love doing a woman in the can.
"
,,
4,9,"Oh, giggidy, giggidy, goo!
"
,,
4,9,"Who else but Quagmire?
"
,,
4,9,"[Singing] <i>He's Quagmire</i>
"
,,
4,9,"Giggidy, giggidy, giggidy.
"
,,
4,9,"I do hope nothing happens
"
,,
4,9,"to spoil this fancy dinner party.
"
,,
4,9,"Giggidy, giggidy, giggidy, giggidy, giggidy,
"
,,
4,9,"giggidy, giggidy, goo.
"
,,
4,9,"Who else but Quagmire?
"
,,
4,9,"Giggidy, giggidy, goo.
"
,,
4,9,"Oh, it is so good to see all of you.
"
,,
4,9,"How is everything at home?
"
,,
4,9,"It's horrible, Lois. I've had to do
"
,,
4,9,"all the things that you usually do.
"
,,
4,9,"Like the other night,
"
,,
4,9,"I had to go to your book club meeting.
"
,,
4,9,"I really admired the mother character's
"
,,
4,9,"admission of personal torment...
"
,,
4,9," after her daughter's death.
"
,,
4,9," I disagree.
"
,,
4,9,"I felt a total lack of ethical integrity...
"
,,
4,9,"in her readiness to abandon her children
"
,,
4,9,"and start a life of her own.
"
,,
4,9,"Here's another thing:
"
,,
4,9,"The book can also be...
"
,,
4,9,"a hat.
"
,,
4,9,"And the other night, I had to do a...
"
,,
4,9,"Well, you know, that thing that you
"
,,
4,9,"usually do for me every Thursday night.
"
,,
4,9,"I can't believe you're serving
"
,,
4,9,"a three-year sentence, it seems so harsh.
"
,,
4,9,"The only upside is that it's given me time
"
,,
4,9,"to think about why I ended up in here.
"
,,
4,9,"I guess I was stealing, because
"
,,
4,9,"I was so sick of the same old routine.
"
,,
4,9,"I felt like I had a void in my life.
"
,,
4,9," Like, there was a secret hole in me.
"
,,
4,9," Oh, God!
"
,,
4,9,"And I was trying to fill that hole with
"
,,
4,9,"all kinds of expensive objects and things.
"
,,
4,9,"Oh, God!
"
,,
4,9,"And I felt wonderful
"
,,
4,9,"with all those things filling that hole.
"
,,
4,9,"Oh, God!
"
,,
4,9,"I did this to myself...
"
,,
4,9,"so I'm just gonna have to lay back and
"
,,
4,9,"let the penal system teach me a lesson.
"
,,
4,9,"That one is also sexual.
"
,,
4,9,"Well, I guess with good behavior,
"
,,
4,9,"you could be out in two years.
"
,,
4,9,"I made my own bed with this one, guys.
"
,,
4,9,"I'm just gonna have to pay my debt
"
,,
4,9,"to society.
"
,,
4,9,"Not necessarily. I think I got an idea
"
,,
4,9,"of how to smuggle you out.
"
,,
4,9,"Bye-bye, take care, now. Have a nice day.
"
,,
4,9,"[Peter mumbling]
"
,,
4,9,"What do we do?
"
,,
4,9,"Hurry! We'll hide in that van.
"
,,
4,9,"My God, you know what this means?
"
,,
4,9," You're all accessories to my escape.
"
,,
4,9," She's right. We're fugitives from the law.
"
,,
4,9," What the hell is wrong with you?
"
,,
4,9," I'm a dog, all right.
"
,,
4,9,"I have a very tough time
"
,,
4,9,"standing up in the car.
"
,,
4,9,"Well, then we're fugitives.
"
,,
4,9,"But at least the family's back together.
"
,,
4,9," I wonder where we're going.
"
,,
4,9," Calm down!
"
,,
4,9,"I'll tell you what were going to do.
"
,,
4,9,"Wherever this van stops,
"
,,
4,9,"we'll begin a new life together.
"
,,
4,9,"We'll blend in
"
,,
4,9,"to the fabric of that community.
"
,,
4,9,"Peter, we're in Asiantown.
"
,,
4,9,"Well, at least I don't have to worry
"
,,
4,9,"about the evil monkey here.
"
,,
4,9,"If we're gonna hide out here in Asiantown
"
,,
4,9,"we have to find a place to live.
"
,,
4,9,"Yes, and we should do nothing to draw
"
,,
4,9,"attention to ourselves as outsiders.
"
,,
4,9,"Oh, my God! It's Jackie Chan.
"
,,
4,9,"Oh, my God! It's Jackie Chan.
"
,,
4,9,"Oh, my God! It's Jackie Chan.
"
,,
4,9,"Hi there!
"
,,
4,9,"Always nice to meet a fan of my movies.
"
,,
4,9," My God, you're Ethan Hawke!
"
,,
4,9," No, I'm not.
"
,,
4,9,"Sorry, my mistake.
"
,,
4,9,"My God, it's Ethan Hawke!
"
,,
4,9," Mom, can we go get some food?
"
,,
4,9," My God, there's Malcolm in middle!
"
,,
4,9," I'm not a boy.
"
,,
4,9," Yes, you are.
"
,,
4,9," I can't believe we have to live here.
"
,,
4,9," This sucks!
"
,,
4,9,"Tell me about it. I haven't seen
"
,,
4,9,"one female baby since we got here.
"
,,
4,9,"This place is a sausage-fest.
"
,,
4,9,"Come on, kids, we've been through worse.
"
,,
4,9,"Meg, you remember when you found out...
"
,,
4,9,"your gynecologist
"
,,
4,9,"never finished med school?
"
,,
4,9,"All right, Meg,
"
,,
4,9,"let's take a look at that bergina.
"
,,
4,9,"But Peter, how are we going to support
"
,,
4,9,"ourselves here?
"
,,
4,9,"We'll all have to get jobs, but I'm sure
"
,,
4,9,"we'll each find something we can do.
"
,,
4,9," Where are you from?
"
,,
4,9," Tokyo.
"
,,
4,9,"Tokyo! Yeah, it's a great town.
"
,,
4,9," Lot of people, though.
"
,,
4,9," Yup.
"
,,
4,9,"You're here on business?
"
,,
4,9,"I bet its business...
"
,,
4,9,"'cause I had a fare earlier today that...
"
,,
4,9,"This used to be a people business,
"
,,
4,9,"but now, I don't know.
"
,,
4,9,"Damn! I say, I seem to have sewn
"
,,
4,9,"a shoe to my hand, may I go to the nurse?
"
,,
4,9,"Replace him!
"
,,
4,9,"Faster!
"
,,
4,9,"So, what exactly would you say
"
,,
4,9,"qualifies you to work as a sumo wrestler?
"
,,
4,9,"Oh, are you kidding?
"
,,
4,9,"I'm a born athlete, just like Greg Louganis.
"
,,
4,9,"Hi, I'm Peter Griffin.
"
,,
4,9,"You're probably asking yourself,
"
,,
4,9,"""Which way are they gonna go?
"
,,
4,9,"""Are they gonna make
"
,,
4,9,"a diving-board head-injury joke?
"
,,
4,9,"""Are they gonna make an AIDS joke?
"
,,
4,9,"""Or are they gonna make a joke
"
,,
4,9,"about the fact...
"
,,
4,9,"""that his last name
"
,,
4,9,"sounds suspiciously like 'anus'?""
"
,,
4,9,"Well, we're gonna take the high road
"
,,
4,9,"and do a no-body-hair joke.
"
,,
4,9," Brian?
"
,,
4,9," Hi, I'm Greg Louganis. I'm totally shaven.
"
,,
4,9,"Terrific! Terrific.
"
,,
4,9,"Damn it, Swanson. I want them found.
"
,,
4,9,"Mayor West, we have every available man
"
,,
4,9,"looking for the Griffins.
"
,,
4,9,"We just don't have any leads.
"
,,
4,9,"Not the Griffins, you moron!
"
,,
4,9,"The rest of my Lite Brite pieces!
"
,,
4,9,"My name isn't ""Adam We""!
"
,,
4,9,"Or is it? Who am I?
"
,,
4,9,"What number did you dial?
"
,,
4,9,"Don't ever call here again.
"
,,
4,9,"I guess I told him!
"
,,
4,9,"Nobody messes with Adam We.
"
,,
4,9,"brought to you by Asian Trix.
"
,,
4,9,"Silly rabbit! Trix are for kids!
"
,,
4,9,"You share!
"
,,
4,9,"I'm not really sure what to do here.
"
,,
4,9,"Boy! You've put on weight, Jackie Chan.
"
,,
4,9,"JOE: Oh, my God!
"
,,
4,9,"BONNIE: Did you walk?
"
,,
4,9,"Oh...
"
,,
4,9,"MAN: <i>You're watching CBS ASIANTOWN.</i>
"
,,
4,9," Hey, everybody, I'm home.
"
,,
4,9," Oh, you're just in time.
"
,,
4,9,"I ordered Caucasian for dinner.
"
,,
4,9,"Chris, I'm hungry.
"
,,
4,9,"It's your turn to keep watch for the cops.
"
,,
4,9,"Wait a minute,
"
,,
4,9,"am I the only one who thinks this is nuts?
"
,,
4,9,"We've given up our whole lives.
"
,,
4,9,"Come on, Brian,
"
,,
4,9,"a change of scenery is always good.
"
,,
4,9,"Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed
"
,,
4,9,"my trip to Nebraska.
"
,,
4,9,"So, anybody see any good movies lately?
"
,,
4,9," No, not really.
"
,,
4,9," No.
"
,,
4,9,"Read any good books?
"
,,
4,9,"No.
"
,,
4,9,"Anything new with corn?
"
,,
4,9," Yeah, corn...
"
,,
4,9," Corn...
"
,,
4,9," You betcha!
"
,,
4,9," Corn...
"
,,
4,9," Yeah.
"
,,
4,9," Corn is always interesting.
"
,,
4,9,"Hey, Mom, Mr. Swanson's here to visit us.
"
,,
4,9,"What?
"
,,
4,9,"Oh, my God, we got to get out of here!
"
,,
4,9,"Taxi! Follow that family.
"
,,
4,9,"Come on, everybody, over the fence.
"
,,
4,9,"Ah, yes, a fence.
"
,,
4,9,"The cripple's natural enemy.
"
,,
4,9,"I think we lost him.
"
,,
4,9," There they are.
"
,,
4,9," Quick! Into the sewer.
"
,,
4,9," Good Lord! It's disgusting down here.
"
,,
4,9," Boy, Stewie's got the right idea.
"
,,
4,9," What the hell are you doing?
"
,,
4,9," It's wet down there, Brian.
"
,,
4,9,"This sucks worse than that time
"
,,
4,9,"I did cocaine with Karl Malden.
"
,,
4,9,"What are you getting
"
,,
4,9,"all bent out of shape about?
"
,,
4,9,"Well, you know, Karl, I didn't get...
"
,,
4,9,"I got virtually nothing here, you know?
"
,,
4,9,"Look, I don't see what the problem is.
"
,,
4,9,"No, you wouldn't, would you?
"
,,
4,9,"Look, all I'm saying is,
"
,,
4,9,"I got the raw end of the deal.
"
,,
4,9," You invited me over.
"
,,
4,9," Yeah, well, now I'm regretting it.
"
,,
4,9,"When I fire rockets...
"
,,
4,9,"I always pretend
"
,,
4,9,"I shooting at Alan Alda and Jamie Farr.
"
,,
4,9,"Take that, wisecracking meatball surgeon!
"
,,
4,9," Which way should we go?
"
,,
4,9," I don't know, let's ask the Goonies.
"
,,
4,9," Take the left one.
"
,,
4,9," Thanks. Hey, Chunk, come here.
"
,,
4,9,"Before you go, do the truffle shuffle.
"
,,
4,9," Oh, come on!
"
,,
4,9," Do the truffle shuffle.
"
,,
4,9,"Childhood obesity.
"
,,
4,9,"Lois, come on, what are you doing?
"
,,
4,9," I can't do it, Peter.
"
,,
4,9," What are you talking about?
"
,,
4,9,"Look at us? We're running
"
,,
4,9,"through a sewer, and it's because of me.
"
,,
4,9,"Look, honey, it was very sweet of you
"
,,
4,9,"to break me out of jail...
"
,,
4,9,"but I did something wrong.
"
,,
4,9,"And I'm the one who should pay,
"
,,
4,9,"not my whole family.
"
,,
4,9,"I'm gonna turn myself in.
"
,,
4,9,"You're mine now, Lois!
"
,,
4,9,"[Joe screaming]
"
,,
4,9,"Oh, my God, Joe!
"
,,
4,9,"Joe, you're too heavy. I can't hang on.
"
,,
4,9,"Pretend I'm your child, Lois.
"
,,
4,9,"Not Meg! Not Meg!
"
,,
4,9,"Lois, you saved my life.
"
,,
4,9,"I say, Corey Haim!
"
,,
4,9,"Are you with the Goonies as well?
"
,,
4,9,"No, I just live down here. Mine!
"
,,
4,9,"It was so nice of Joe to work things out
"
,,
4,9,"with that judge.
"
,,
4,9,"Yeah, but I'm sure gonna miss my buddies
"
,,
4,9,"down at the sumo ring.
"
,,
4,9,"Dad, can you teach me
"
,,
4,9,"how to sumo wrestle?
"
,,
4,9,"It's not too hard, Chris.
"
,,
4,9,"Brian, help me demonstrate.
"
,,
4,9," Peter, maybe somebody else could...
"
,,
4,9," Come on!
"
,,
4,9,"Okay, so on the count to three,
"
,,
4,9,"you try to push me out of the ring...
"
,,
4,9,"I try to push you out of the ring.
"
,,
4,9,"Okay? Ready?
"
,,
4,9,"One, two, three!
"
,,
4,9,"What the hell? What the hell?
"
,,
4,9," Brian, I'm sorry...
"
,,
4,9," No! No. You know what?
"
,,
4,9,"It's not cool, Peter. It's not cool.
"
,,
4,10,"It seems today that all you see
"
,,
4,10,"Is violence in movies and sex on TV
"
,,
4,10,"But where are those
"
,,
4,10,"good old-fashioned values
"
,,
4,10,"On which we used to rely?
"
,,
4,10,"Lucky there's a family guy
"
,,
4,10,"Lucky there's a man
"
,,
4,10,"who positively can do
"
,,
4,10,"all the things that make us
"
,,
4,10,"Laugh and cry
"
,,
4,10,"He's a family guy
"
,,
4,10,"Come on, everybody. Let's go.
"
,,
4,10,"Oh, this is so exciting.
"
,,
4,10,"This is the tenth year my father's
"
,,
4,10,"raced his yacht in the Newport Regatta.
"
,,
4,10,"Man, I hope he lets me
"
,,
4,10,"on his team this year.
"
,,
4,10,"I haven't been part of a team
"
,,
4,10,"since I was with the Four Peters.
"
,,
4,10," Come on, Stewie. Let's go.
"
,,
4,10," Yes, yes. I'm just checking the mall.
"
,,
4,10," I say, here's one from the vet.
"
,,
4,10," Give me that.
"
,,
4,10,"Good lord, worms? You have worms?
"
,,
4,10,"I don't have worms, all right?
"
,,
4,10,"I just got checked for worms.
"
,,
4,10,"Oh, wait. No, I do have worms.
"
,,
4,10,"Oh, God. What am I gonna do?
"
,,
4,10,"I can't afford the medication for this.
"
,,
4,10," Well, you could ask Lois and the fat one.
"
,,
4,10," No. No. No.
"
,,
4,10,"You cannot tell them about this, please.
"
,,
4,10,"Peter is not very discreet
"
,,
4,10,"with private matters.
"
,,
4,10,"Hey, everybody!
"
,,
4,10,"Meg just had her first period!
"
,,
4,10,"Peter, shut up!
"
,,
4,10,"It's 3:00 in the morning.
"
,,
4,10,"What the hell's
"
,,
4,10,"going on out there?
"
,,
4,10,"Damn it! People are
"
,,
4,10,"trying to sleep.
"
,,
4,10,"I'm just saying, I'm proud of her.
"
,,
4,10,"She's a woman.
"
,,
4,10,"Yes, that's very hot,
"
,,
4,10,"and I'll deaI with it in the morning...
"
,,
4,10,"but right now, I am exhausted.
"
,,
4,10,"Just please don't tell them.
"
,,
4,10,"Perhaps you should worry
"
,,
4,10,"a little less about your pride...
"
,,
4,10,"and a little more about
"
,,
4,10,"the creepy-crawlies...
"
,,
4,10,"shawshanking their way
"
,,
4,10,"out of your balloon knot.
"
,,
4,10,"Come on, kids.
"
,,
4,10,"Off to Grandma and Grandpa's house.
"
,,
4,10,"Thank God I finally get some time away
"
,,
4,10,"from the eviI monkey in my closet.
"
,,
4,10,"Mrs. Babs. Mr. Carter.
"
,,
4,10,"La familia Griffin.
"
,,
4,10,"Lois, darling. It's wonderfuI to see you.
"
,,
4,10,"Hi, Mom. Hi, Daddy.
"
,,
4,10," Grandpa!
"
,,
4,10," Hello, everyone.
"
,,
4,10,"Hiya, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
4,10,"Peter, I see
"
,,
4,10,"you're still fatter than holy hell.
"
,,
4,10,"You can read me like a book.
"
,,
4,10,"So, which of the Latin countries
"
,,
4,10,"are you from?
"
,,
4,10,"The one with the civiI war,
"
,,
4,10,"the one with the cocaine...
"
,,
4,10,"or the one with the fancy hats?
"
,,
4,10,"Isn't this fun, Peter?
"
,,
4,10,"You and I get to stay
"
,,
4,10,"in my old high-schooI room.
"
,,
4,10,"Wow. This looks
"
,,
4,10,"just like my room at home.
"
,,
4,10,"Yeah, except for all the trophies
"
,,
4,10,"and pictures of friends.
"
,,
4,10,"That's the second most impressive trophy
"
,,
4,10,"I've ever seen.
"
,,
4,10,"And the Grammy for Album of the Year
"
,,
4,10,"goes to...
"
,,
4,10,"Justin Timberlake.
"
,,
4,10,"It actually goes to Nelly.
"
,,
4,10,"Nelly.
"
,,
4,10,"Wow, Mom.
"
,,
4,10,"Were you a Miss Teen Rhode Island?
"
,,
4,10,"I sure was, Meg, when I was 16 years old.
"
,,
4,10,"In fact, your mom
"
,,
4,10,"was offered a modeling contract.
"
,,
4,10,"Really? Why didn't you take it?
"
,,
4,10,"Well, I wanted to,
"
,,
4,10,"but your grandfather wouldn't let me.
"
,,
4,10,"But, Daddy, they offered me a contract.
"
,,
4,10,"My girI is not lowering herself
"
,,
4,10,"to modeling.
"
,,
4,10,"That sort of uncouth activity
"
,,
4,10,"is below this family.
"
,,
4,10,"Now go away. I'm busy.
"
,,
4,10," Farnsworth.
"
,,
4,10," The usuaI, sir?
"
,,
4,10," Feeding the worms, are you?
"
,,
4,10," Stewie, shut up, all right?
"
,,
4,10,"Yes, I imagine those little fellows
"
,,
4,10,"are enjoying quite a feast.
"
,,
4,10,"You know what's interesting?
"
,,
4,10,"I've only been allve for six weeks.
"
,,
4,10,"I know nothing of the world
"
,,
4,10,"beyond this dog's stomach.
"
,,
4,10,"And I still find Six Feet Under pretentious.
"
,,
4,10,"So, Mr. Pewterschmidt,
"
,,
4,10,"the big race is tomorrow, eh?
"
,,
4,10,"Bet you're gonna need
"
,,
4,10,"some big strapping men...
"
,,
4,10,"to help you with your boat.
"
,,
4,10,"Are you calling me gay?
"
,,
4,10,"No. No, I just thought you might want
"
,,
4,10,"some extra seamen...
"
,,
4,10,"on your poop deck.
"
,,
4,10,"Cashscam is your way
"
,,
4,10,"to make reaI money.
"
,,
4,10,"You could become rich
"
,,
4,10,"beyond your wildest dreams...
"
,,
4,10,"by selling these fine products
"
,,
4,10,"over the phone.
"
,,
4,10,"Rich beyond my wildest dreams.
"
,,
4,10,"I say, I could be a millionaire playboy.
"
,,
4,10,"Okay, girls. Are you all ready to play?
"
,,
4,10,"all right, then. One, two, three.
"
,,
4,10,"Green light.
"
,,
4,10,"Red light. Green light.
"
,,
4,10,"Red light.
"
,,
4,10,"Brandy, you're out.
"
,,
4,10,"Sorry, you have to sleep
"
,,
4,10,"with Rob Schneider tonight.
"
,,
4,10,"""Making copies. "" Remember that?
"
,,
4,10,"I was born in 1987.
"
,,
4,10,"Ladies and gentlemen...
"
,,
4,10,"welcome to the 20th annuaI
"
,,
4,10,"Newport Regatta.
"
,,
4,10,"Newport would like to extend
"
,,
4,10,"a speciaI welcome...
"
,,
4,10,"to all those here today who have children
"
,,
4,10,"stationed overseas in Iraq.
"
,,
4,10,"I'm just kidding.
"
,,
4,10,"There they are, team Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
4,10,"Say, where's your husband
"
,,
4,10,"or as I call him, ""my son-in-lard""?
"
,,
4,10,"Snap. Snap.
"
,,
4,10,"Oh, I'm sure he'll be along, Daddy.
"
,,
4,10,"Ahoy, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
4,10,"Peter, what the hell are you doing
"
,,
4,10,"in my bathtub?
"
,,
4,10,"Oh, this is not a bathtub.
"
,,
4,10,"This is the SS Pewterschmidt Kicker.
"
,,
4,10,"This is ridiculous.
"
,,
4,10,"I won't have a member of my family
"
,,
4,10,"racing in a bathtub.
"
,,
4,10,"Well, Daddy,
"
,,
4,10,"you didn't want Peter in your boat...
"
,,
4,10,"so team Griffin is gonna give you
"
,,
4,10,"a run for your money.
"
,,
4,10,"And now, to fire
"
,,
4,10,"the starting gun...
"
,,
4,10,"is recently paroled presidentiaI assassin,
"
,,
4,10,"John Hinckley.
"
,,
4,10,"You fired that gun reaI nice, John.
"
,,
4,10,"Wow, Jodie Foster. Hey, thanks.
"
,,
4,10,"Maybe I was wrong about you.
"
,,
4,10,"Maybe I was wrong about all men.
"
,,
4,10,"We're not going fast enough.
"
,,
4,10," Loser!
"
,,
4,10," What did he say?
"
,,
4,10," Hello?
"
,,
4,10," I said you're a loser.
"
,,
4,10,"Who is this?
"
,,
4,10,"There's the finish line.
"
,,
4,10,"We can't let him beat us.
"
,,
4,10,"We gotta lose some extra weight.
"
,,
4,10,"Quick, everyone, take off your clothes.
"
,,
4,10," It's working.
"
,,
4,10," Just need a little more...
"
,,
4,10,"We love you, honey.
"
,,
4,10,"Lois, what the hell were you doing
"
,,
4,10,"out there?
"
,,
4,10,"Not listening to you for once, Daddy...
"
,,
4,10,"and look what happened.
"
,,
4,10,"I had a lot of fun.
"
,,
4,10,"I should've stopped listening to you
"
,,
4,10,"a long time ago.
"
,,
4,10," Let's go home, Peter.
"
,,
4,10," Right behind you.
"
,,
4,10,"Hey, where's Meg?
"
,,
4,10,"What is it, sir?
"
,,
4,10,"That's what we call a manatee, boys...
"
,,
4,10,"or, in nauticaI slang, the sea-cow.
"
,,
4,10,"Damn these worms. Ow, this itch.
"
,,
4,10,"Brian, what the hell are you doing?
"
,,
4,10,"Nothing. Just some Pilates.
"
,,
4,10,"Don't lie to me, Brian. I know what this is.
"
,,
4,10,"You're looking for an ass-race.
"
,,
4,10,"First one to the kitchen wins. Go!
"
,,
4,10," Still got the worms, eh?
"
,,
4,10," Yeah, that stupid medicine's $300.
"
,,
4,10,"Well, let me make you a proposaI.
"
,,
4,10,"I'll front you the money,
"
,,
4,10,"and you pay it off by working for me.
"
,,
4,10,"Cashscam? Are you kidding? I don't want
"
,,
4,10,"anything to do with that pyramid scheme.
"
,,
4,10," Very well, then. Enjoy your worms.
"
,,
4,10," Wait. Wait.
"
,,
4,10,"What would I have to do?
"
,,
4,10,"Just be in my room tomorrow at 9:00 a. m.
"
,,
4,10,"for orientation.
"
,,
4,10,"UntiI then, keep this in mind.
"
,,
4,10,"Whether you think you can
"
,,
4,10,"or you think you can't, you're right.
"
,,
4,10,"See you tomorrow.
"
,,
4,10,"Hey, everybody. Wait till you see this.
"
,,
4,10,"Oh, my God. Movable printed type.
"
,,
4,10,"We must keep this from the serfs
"
,,
4,10,"lest they gain literacy...
"
,,
4,10,"and threaten the landed gentry.
"
,,
4,10," What you got there, my lord?
"
,,
4,10," Nothing. Back to your turnips.
"
,,
4,10,"Look, it's a picture of us at the Regatta.
"
,,
4,10,"Wow, Mom. You look pretty.
"
,,
4,10,"Thank you, Chris. I thought so, too.
"
,,
4,10,"And you know what?
"
,,
4,10,"I'm gonna take that chance...
"
,,
4,10,"my father never let me take
"
,,
4,10,"when I was younger.
"
,,
4,10,"I'm gonna become a modeI.
"
,,
4,10,"Hey, that's fantastic, Lois.
"
,,
4,10,"And I'll pleasure myself to your photos.
"
,,
4,10," Me, too.
"
,,
4,10," Me, too.
"
,,
4,10,"Oh, God. Meg, that's sick.
"
,,
4,10," That's your mother.
"
,,
4,10," I'm just trying to fit in.
"
,,
4,10,"Get out. Get out of this house.
"
,,
4,10,"I said now!
"
,,
4,10,"That's good about your modeling, Lois.
"
,,
4,10,"Here are your pictures, Lois.
"
,,
4,10,"They sure are terrific.
"
,,
4,10,"Thank you, Mort.
"
,,
4,10,"I'm trying to get into modeling.
"
,,
4,10,"That's great. Oh, hey! Get out of here.
"
,,
4,10,"Hey, go on. Get out.
"
,,
4,10," I didn't hurt anybody.
"
,,
4,10," Scat, Mister.
"
,,
4,10,"I know deep down I'm your friend.
"
,,
4,10,"That greased-up deaf guy
"
,,
4,10,"is going to be the death of me.
"
,,
4,10,"Like business isn't bad enough already.
"
,,
4,10,"Well, gosh, Mort. You ever think
"
,,
4,10,"about sending out a maller?
"
,,
4,10,"'Cause I know where you could get
"
,,
4,10,"a good deaI on a modeI.
"
,,
4,10," I'm touching on the candy.
"
,,
4,10," Get out. Get out.
"
,,
4,10,"What the hell is all this?
"
,,
4,10,"Oh, Brian, you're here. Good.
"
,,
4,10,"Okay, let me give you the rundown.
"
,,
4,10,"This is your work area.
"
,,
4,10,"Please keep personaI knickknacks tastefuI.
"
,,
4,10,"You get 25 minutes for lunch, and...
"
,,
4,10,"Enjoy it here.
"
,,
4,10,"Welcome aboard.
"
,,
4,10," Yes?
"
,,
4,10," It's Brian.
"
,,
4,10,"Oh, yes, the new fellow. Come on in.
"
,,
4,10,"What exactly am I supposed to do?
"
,,
4,10,"You'll pick up the phone
"
,,
4,10,"and you'll sell, sell, sell.
"
,,
4,10,"But before you go thinking
"
,,
4,10,"it's all seriousness...
"
,,
4,10,"the first Friday of every month
"
,,
4,10,"is Wacky-Tacky-Tie Day...
"
,,
4,10,"so, you know, start thinking up
"
,,
4,10,"some fun tacky ties to wear.
"
,,
4,10,"Oh, we're done.
"
,,
4,10,"Here you go, guys.
"
,,
4,10,"Lois, could I be a son of a bitch
"
,,
4,10,"and impose on you...
"
,,
4,10,"to sign one of your flyers for me.
"
,,
4,10,"Of course, Cleveland.
"
,,
4,10,"Oh, man.
"
,,
4,10,"I can't believe I'm sleeping with a modeI.
"
,,
4,10,"I'm luckier than the State of Rhode Island.
"
,,
4,10,"Well, I can't decide what to call this place.
"
,,
4,10,"We'll flip a coin.
"
,,
4,10,"all right. Heads, Rhode Island.
"
,,
4,10,"Talls, Ca-ca-poo-poo-pee-pee-shire.
"
,,
4,10,"Pardon me. Are you Lois Griffin,
"
,,
4,10,"the Goldman's Pharmacy girI?
"
,,
4,10,"Yes, I suppose I am.
"
,,
4,10,"Karin Parotta, modeling agent.
"
,,
4,10,"Listen, sugar, I've seen your stuff.
"
,,
4,10,"You're a breath of fresh air in my stoma.
"
,,
4,10,"I could get you a lot more work
"
,,
4,10,"if you sign with my agency.
"
,,
4,10,"Really? Oh, my God! How exciting.
"
,,
4,10,"Well, here's my card. Give me a call.
"
,,
4,10,"Now, perhaps some young gentleman
"
,,
4,10,"would like to light me up.
"
,,
4,10,"allow me.
"
,,
4,10,"So, what's going on?
"
,,
4,10,"You ever get freaky
"
,,
4,10,"with that thing or what?
"
,,
4,10,"Brian, could you
"
,,
4,10,"come in here for one second?
"
,,
4,10,"Yeah, what is-
"
,,
4,10,"Hang on. Hang on one second.
"
,,
4,10,"Yes, Grover, what is it?
"
,,
4,10,"This has to be quick.
"
,,
4,10,"I am so pressed.
"
,,
4,10,"Yes, the letter ""G"" is wonderfuI.
"
,,
4,10,"Of course, and the number ""6.""
"
,,
4,10,"Okay. Okay.
"
,,
4,10,"Grover. Grover. Grover.
"
,,
4,10,"Grover. Grover.
"
,,
4,10,"You know what? If you're gonna shout,
"
,,
4,10,"we can just talk later.
"
,,
4,10,"Okay. all right, you know what?
"
,,
4,10,"Call me back when you calm down.
"
,,
4,10,"You wanted something?
"
,,
4,10,"Oh, yes. Can you go ahead
"
,,
4,10,"and send Lois a congratulatory basket?
"
,,
4,10,"Thank you.
"
,,
4,10,"Oh, and if Cookie Monster calls,
"
,,
4,10,"tell him I'm not talking to him...
"
,,
4,10,"untiI he gets out of rehab.
"
,,
4,10,"Contraband check.
"
,,
4,10," What are these?
"
,,
4,10," I don't know.
"
,,
4,10,"What do you mean, you don't know?
"
,,
4,10,"I don't know how they got there.
"
,,
4,10,"Well, I think you do know.
"
,,
4,10,"No. No, Derek was in here earlier.
"
,,
4,10,"He was making the beds.
"
,,
4,10,"He probably put them... I was in the john.
"
,,
4,10,"You guys are Nazis, man.
"
,,
4,10,"You're freaking Nazis.
"
,,
4,10,"Well, here we are, Lois.
"
,,
4,10,"Your first professionaI photo shoot.
"
,,
4,10,"Karin, this is so exciting.
"
,,
4,10,"Knock them dead, honey.
"
,,
4,10,"Hey. Peter Griffin. How's it going?
"
,,
4,10,"I'm... I'm hitting that.
"
,,
4,10,"Hi, is Mr. Donald Nguyen there, please?
"
,,
4,10,"And is he the head of the household?
"
,,
4,10,"If I can just have a few moments
"
,,
4,10,"of your time...
"
,,
4,10,"Hello?
"
,,
4,10,"Oh, Brian, there you are.
"
,,
4,10,"Can I talk to you about something?
"
,,
4,10,"Yeah, what is it?
"
,,
4,10,"That coffee mug you have on your desk
"
,,
4,10,"that says, ""Life's a beach""...
"
,,
4,10,"that's dangerously close
"
,,
4,10,"to the word ""bitch,"" isn't it?
"
,,
4,10,"Yeah, that's the joke.
"
,,
4,10,"Absolutely, and nobody
"
,,
4,10,"appreciates a joke like Stewie.
"
,,
4,10,"And, you know, between you and me,
"
,,
4,10,"I think it's a stitch...
"
,,
4,10,"but some of the other employees
"
,,
4,10,"have found it offensive.
"
,,
4,10,"Other employees?
"
,,
4,10,"Who else works here besides me?
"
,,
4,10,"...you. That's who works here!
"
,,
4,10,"Dinner's almost ready, kids.
"
,,
4,10,"Wow, Lois, look at you.
"
,,
4,10,"You're like Britney Spears...
"
,,
4,10,"except you're not a fat guy.
"
,,
4,10,"I'll get it.
"
,,
4,10,"Dad, how could you be okay with Mom
"
,,
4,10,"parading herself around like this?
"
,,
4,10,"I mean, she's half-naked.
"
,,
4,10,"It makes all women look bad.
"
,,
4,10,"Meg, who let you back in the house?
"
,,
4,10,"Oh, Karin. Come on in.
"
,,
4,10,"Lois, I got your new headshots,
"
,,
4,10,"and I set up a shoot for you...
"
,,
4,10,"over at Glamour next Monday...
"
,,
4,10,"but, sugar,
"
,,
4,10,"you're gonna need these to stay on top.
"
,,
4,10,"Diet pills? Karin, I'm not gonna take these.
"
,,
4,10,"I don't need to.
"
,,
4,10,"Lois, sooner or later
"
,,
4,10,"every modeI needs a little boost, huh?
"
,,
4,10,"I just wanna make sure
"
,,
4,10,"you got everything you need.
"
,,
4,10," Hey, you like Pez?
"
,,
4,10," Sure.
"
,,
4,10,"Hey, who's putting together a puzzle?
"
,,
4,10,"'Cause I just found a hot piece.
"
,,
4,10,"Wow. Lois, you look great.
"
,,
4,10,"I'd like to split you in half
"
,,
4,10,"like a piece of lumber.
"
,,
4,10,"Thank you, Glenn.
"
,,
4,10,"Yeah, Lois.
"
,,
4,10,"I'd like to wear you like a hockey mask.
"
,,
4,10,"You guys!
"
,,
4,10,"Okay, easy, fellas.
"
,,
4,10,"Lois, I'd like to make
"
,,
4,10,"a carameI-colored baby with you.
"
,,
4,10,"Take it easy, Cleveland.
"
,,
4,10,"Take your jacket off.
"
,,
4,10,"Jacket off. Jacket off. Jacket off.
"
,,
4,10,"all right. all right. That's it. That's enough.
"
,,
4,10,"Peter, what are you doing?
"
,,
4,10,"Lois, if you being a modeI
"
,,
4,10,"means you're going to be eye-candy...
"
,,
4,10,"for the whole town,
"
,,
4,10,"then I ain't going for it.
"
,,
4,10,"Excuse me?
"
,,
4,10,"Who do you think you are, my father?
"
,,
4,10,"Lois, I think Meg was right.
"
,,
4,10,"Lowering yourself and women
"
,,
4,10,"and something and all that noise.
"
,,
4,10,"You can't stop me from modeling, Peter.
"
,,
4,10,"This is important to me.
"
,,
4,10,"I am going to the top, and there's nothing
"
,,
4,10,"you or anyone else can do about it.
"
,,
4,10,"Who the hell does he think he is?
"
,,
4,10,"Come on. Come on.
"
,,
4,10,"Go away!
"
,,
4,10,"We now return to...
"
,,
4,10,"Mmm-mmmh.
"
,,
4,10,"Mmm-hmmm.
"
,,
4,10,"Mmm-hmmmh.
"
,,
4,10,"Mmm-hmmm.
"
,,
4,10,"Hey, there, sweetie.
"
,,
4,10,"I got a wax this morning,
"
,,
4,10,"and let's just say...
"
,,
4,10," you're cleared for landing, huh?
"
,,
4,10," Giggidy!
"
,,
4,10,"Lois, what the hell's up with you lately?
"
,,
4,10,"You're acting all weird,
"
,,
4,10,"and you're staying out all night.
"
,,
4,10,"I was just out with some of the girls,
"
,,
4,10,"and you're not gonna believe this.
"
,,
4,10,"I got invited to a Vogue magazine party.
"
,,
4,10,"That guest list is more exclusive
"
,,
4,10,"than the Garden of Eden.
"
,,
4,10,"So, basically, you can eat from
"
,,
4,10,"any tree you want, except this one.
"
,,
4,10,"Can we sit underneath it?
"
,,
4,10,"You know,
"
,,
4,10,"I would just not go near it at all.
"
,,
4,10,"Brian, thanks for showing up so promptly
"
,,
4,10,"for your quarterly evaluation.
"
,,
4,10,"Now, then. I'm going to do something
"
,,
4,10,"I call the compliment sandwich...
"
,,
4,10,"where I say something good, then talk
"
,,
4,10,"about where you need improvement...
"
,,
4,10,"and then end with something good.
"
,,
4,10,"Whatever you gotta do.
"
,,
4,10,"Okay.
"
,,
4,10,"Let's see. Something good.
"
,,
4,10,"Something good. Something good.
"
,,
4,10,"You look like Snoopy,
"
,,
4,10,"and it makes me smile.
"
,,
4,10,"Where you need improvement.
"
,,
4,10,"You have smelly dog farts.
"
,,
4,10,"Something good. Something good.
"
,,
4,10,"You really dazzled that rep
"
,,
4,10,"from the Cincinnati office last week.
"
,,
4,10,"That is sensationaI. You really made me
"
,,
4,10,"feeI confident about those numbers.
"
,,
4,10,"Listen, if you're ever looking
"
,,
4,10,"for a change of scenery...
"
,,
4,10,"we could sure use
"
,,
4,10,"a fellow like you in Cincinnati.
"
,,
4,10," That was you in disguise.
"
,,
4,10," No, it wasn't.
"
,,
4,10," Yes, it was.
"
,,
4,10," No, it wasn't.
"
,,
4,10," Fine, it wasn't.
"
,,
4,10," It was.
"
,,
4,10,"Mr. Pewterschmidt, I need your help.
"
,,
4,10,"Lois is out of controI.
"
,,
4,10,"I mean, she's acting crazier than I did
"
,,
4,10,"that time I tried Ecstasy.
"
,,
4,10,"Oh, Brian, your fur is so soft.
"
,,
4,10,"Oh, your ears.
"
,,
4,10,"Your ears are like dog ears.
"
,,
4,10,"Oh, this couch.
"
,,
4,10,"Stewie, your head is so smooth.
"
,,
4,10,"How is that even... How you doing that?
"
,,
4,10,"How you doing that?
"
,,
4,10,"Oh! Everything here is fantastic.
"
,,
4,10,"Oh, these clothes.
"
,,
4,10,"I'm really worried about her,
"
,,
4,10,"Mr. Pewterschmidt...
"
,,
4,10,"and I figured I'd come to you since
"
,,
4,10,"you were always good at reeling her in.
"
,,
4,10,"Well, Lois was always a wild stallion...
"
,,
4,10,"but don't worry.
"
,,
4,10,"I know how to controI her.
"
,,
4,10,"And I'll help you...
"
,,
4,10,"but first, you have to do something for me.
"
,,
4,10,"Eat this pine cone.
"
,,
4,10," Well...
"
,,
4,10," Eat it. It will amuse me.
"
,,
4,10," How is it? How does it taste?
"
,,
4,10," It's awfuI.
"
,,
4,10," Finish it. Eat it.
"
,,
4,10," I hate it.
"
,,
4,10,"Eat it. Eat it. Swallow it.
"
,,
4,10," It hurts.
"
,,
4,10," This is for Lois. Go on.
"
,,
4,10," It hurts!
"
,,
4,10," Good.
"
,,
4,10," all right. We good to go?
"
,,
4,10," Yup.
"
,,
4,10,"all right, how's my man-tan?
"
,,
4,10,"There we go. all set.
"
,,
4,10,"Good. A little body glitter for you.
"
,,
4,10,"Yeah. Yeah. That's hot. That's hot.
"
,,
4,10,"all right, let's do this.
"
,,
4,10," What are you doing? Like... obvious.
"
,,
4,10," Shut up.
"
,,
4,10,"Check out these ribs, Lois.
"
,,
4,10,"Oh, yeah? That's nothing.
"
,,
4,10,"Go ahead. Try them out.
"
,,
4,10,"Hey, not bad.
"
,,
4,10," You see Jimmy Smits in there?
"
,,
4,10," Yeah.
"
,,
4,10,"Yeah, that was cooI.
"
,,
4,10,"So, what did you wanna see me about?
"
,,
4,10,"You know, Brian, there was a note
"
,,
4,10,"in the suggestion box that says:
"
,,
4,10,"""Stewie should eat a steaming bag of... ""
"
,,
4,10,"Well, I'm not gonna say the last word,
"
,,
4,10,"but I think you know what it is.
"
,,
4,10,"Look, Brian, a corporation
"
,,
4,10,"is a lot like a centipede.
"
,,
4,10,"It only works if all the legs are moving
"
,,
4,10,"toward the same end.
"
,,
4,10,"And you know what you are, Brian?
"
,,
4,10," You're a busted leg.
"
,,
4,10," What?
"
,,
4,10,"Are you firing me?
"
,,
4,10,"Don't think about coming back
"
,,
4,10,"and shooting up the place...
"
,,
4,10,"because security has your picture.
"
,,
4,10,"What the hell are you guys doing?
"
,,
4,10,"You're not leaving this room untiI
"
,,
4,10,"you agree to stop this modeling thing...
"
,,
4,10,"once and for all.
"
,,
4,10,"This isn't gonna work, you guys.
"
,,
4,10,"Why can't you understand
"
,,
4,10,"I'm doing what I want?
"
,,
4,10,"Jeez, Carter, what are we doing?
"
,,
4,10,"I mean, if Lois wants to be a modeI...
"
,,
4,10,"we don't got any right to stop her.
"
,,
4,10,"You really mean that, Peter?
"
,,
4,10,"Of course, I do.
"
,,
4,10,"I just want you to be happy.
"
,,
4,10,"This is ridiculous.
"
,,
4,10,"No daughter of mine is going to be happy.
"
,,
4,10,"Excuse me, Carter. I think I owe you this.
"
,,
4,10,"That's for giving me a book last Christmas.
"
,,
4,10,"You're rich, you jerk.
"
,,
4,10,"Well, Lois, I guess you should go ahead
"
,,
4,10,"and get back to your party.
"
,,
4,10,"What's wrong?
"
,,
4,10,"Aren't you gonna go do your little turn
"
,,
4,10,"on the catwalk, Lois?
"
,,
4,10,"On the catwalk?
"
,,
4,10,"Yeah, on the catwalk?
"
,,
4,10,"Do your little turn on the catwalk?
"
,,
4,10,"Well, now that you say
"
,,
4,10,"you're fine with it...
"
,,
4,10,"to be honest, I'm not really sure
"
,,
4,10,"I wanna do it anymore.
"
,,
4,10,"I think all I really wanted
"
,,
4,10,"was the freedom to know I could...
"
,,
4,10,"and now I have it because I have you.
"
,,
4,10,"You sure do, Lois.
"
,,
4,10,"What are we gonna do with him?
"
,,
4,10,"Hey, you wanna make him
"
,,
4,10,"really mad, Lois?
"
,,
4,10,"Let's have sex on his back like we used to.
"
,,
4,10,"What the hell's going on?
"
,,
4,11,"It seems today that all you see
"
,,
4,11,"Is violence in movies and sex on TV
"
,,
4,11,"But where are those
"
,,
4,11,"good old-fashioned values
"
,,
4,11,"On which we used to rely?
"
,,
4,11,"Lucky there's a family guy
"
,,
4,11,"Lucky there's a man who
"
,,
4,11,"Positively can do
"
,,
4,11,"all the things that make us
"
,,
4,11,"Laugh and cry
"
,,
4,11,"He's a family guy
"
,,
4,11,"And now back to
"
,,
4,11,"Old People Agree With Arnold Palmer.
"
,,
4,11,"Tomato soup, grilled cheese,
"
,,
4,11,"and a weak cup of tea...
"
,,
4,11,"is the best lunch in my book.
"
,,
4,11," He's right.
"
,,
4,11," I enjoy things I remember.
"
,,
4,11,"Peter, I'm off to my book club.
"
,,
4,11,"Don't forget you have to go
"
,,
4,11,"to the PTA meeting.
"
,,
4,11,"Me? Go to a PTA meeting?
"
,,
4,11,"What, are you high?
"
,,
4,11,"Not anymore. I crashed hours ago.
"
,,
4,11,"By the way, we're out of chips,
"
,,
4,11,"cookies, and Funny Bones.
"
,,
4,11,"Now, I'm going to my book club
"
,,
4,11,"and you are going to the meeting.
"
,,
4,11,"Hey, Brian, how about you go
"
,,
4,11,"to that meeting for me, huh?
"
,,
4,11,"Yeah. I don't think so.
"
,,
4,11,"Oh, come on, buddy. You owe me.
"
,,
4,11,"You remember
"
,,
4,11,"what I did for you last week?
"
,,
4,11,"Sighing softly to the river
"
,,
4,11,"Comes the loving breeze
"
,,
4,11,"Setting nature all aquiver
"
,,
4,11,"Rustling through the trees
"
,,
4,11,"Through the trees!
"
,,
4,11,"all right. I'll go.
"
,,
4,11,"Quagmire, what are you doing here?
"
,,
4,11,"You don't have kids.
"
,,
4,11,"Don't be so sure, Brian.
"
,,
4,11,"I've slept with chicks all over the world.
"
,,
4,11,"Who knows, I could have kids in their 20s.
"
,,
4,11," What are you doing here?
"
,,
4,11," I got roped into this by Peter.
"
,,
4,11,"Wow, that's a lovely color.
"
,,
4,11,"Your dress is...
"
,,
4,11,"The color of your dress is...
"
,,
4,11," I like... You're very pretty.
"
,,
4,11," Oh, thank you.
"
,,
4,11,"I'm the 11th grade history teacher,
"
,,
4,11,"Miss Parks.
"
,,
4,11,"Oh! Like Rosa Parks.
"
,,
4,11,"Or, you know,
"
,,
4,11,"or someone white named Parks.
"
,,
4,11,"Nothing cuter than a nervous white dog.
"
,,
4,11,"Well, I'm Brian and...
"
,,
4,11,"gosh, if I'm not being too forward,
"
,,
4,11,"it's lovely to meet you, Miss Parks.
"
,,
4,11,"Oh, please. Call me Shauna.
"
,,
4,11,"Shauna! Shauna!
"
,,
4,11,"So, Brian, you ready
"
,,
4,11,"to go play some darts at The Clam?
"
,,
4,11,"Sorry, Peter. I can't make it tonight.
"
,,
4,11,"I have a date.
"
,,
4,11,"Dad!
"
,,
4,11,"You were supposed to drive tonight.
"
,,
4,11,"What am I supposed to do?
"
,,
4,11,"If I drive, I'll have to have
"
,,
4,11,"a bunch of drinks first...
"
,,
4,11,"because I am very self-conscious
"
,,
4,11,"about my driving.
"
,,
4,11,"Oh, you've got a date! What's his name?
"
,,
4,11,"Do you see that? Do you see what I did?
"
,,
4,11,"I made it seem
"
,,
4,11,"as though you were a homosexuaI.
"
,,
4,11,"That's funny to me.
"
,,
4,11,"How exciting, Brian.
"
,,
4,11,"So who's the lucky lady?
"
,,
4,11,"Well, actually, her name is Shauna Parks.
"
,,
4,11,"Meg's teacher?
"
,,
4,11,"Yeah, we really hit it off. She's great.
"
,,
4,11,"Brian on a date.
"
,,
4,11,"That'll be more pathetic than that game
"
,,
4,11,"of Marco Polo I played with Helen Keller.
"
,,
4,11,"Marco.
"
,,
4,11,"Marco.
"
,,
4,11,"Marco.
"
,,
4,11,"Marco.
"
,,
4,11,"Marco.
"
,,
4,11,"Marco.
"
,,
4,11,"Marco.
"
,,
4,11,"Marco.
"
,,
4,11,"Marco.
"
,,
4,11,"I don't know. I mean,
"
,,
4,11,"I think I want to have kids someday.
"
,,
4,11,"Oh, I love kids. I just love them.
"
,,
4,11,"I can't get enough of those little buggers,
"
,,
4,11,"let me tell you.
"
,,
4,11,"You know, it's like I tell the other
"
,,
4,11,"volunteers down at the adoption center:
"
,,
4,11,"My God, you know, if I could just take
"
,,
4,11,"all the orphans in the world...
"
,,
4,11,"and just, you know,
"
,,
4,11,"buy a farm somewhere...
"
,,
4,11,"and let them all run free, you know.
"
,,
4,11,"Just let them do little macaroni-art
"
,,
4,11,"pictures of their dead parents.
"
,,
4,11,"So what's it like to work
"
,,
4,11,"at a high schooI?
"
,,
4,11,"Oh, Brian, I just love it.
"
,,
4,11,"Working at James Woods High is great.
"
,,
4,11,"You know, I've always wondered why they
"
,,
4,11,"named if after James Woods, you know?
"
,,
4,11,"I mean, there's got to be somebody
"
,,
4,11,"more deserving.
"
,,
4,11,"Like, just, you know,
"
,,
4,11,"off the top of my head, I don't know...
"
,,
4,11,"Sidney Poitier, Reggie Jackson,
"
,,
4,11,"Martin Luther King...
"
,,
4,11,"You know, those are just three names
"
,,
4,11,"that come to mind.
"
,,
4,11,"Brian, that's a great idea.
"
,,
4,11,"We should get them to rename the schooI
"
,,
4,11,"after Dr. King.
"
,,
4,11,"You like Dr. King? Because I love Dr. King.
"
,,
4,11,"I love... M.L.K!
"
,,
4,11,"Man, he's my guy.
"
,,
4,11,"He's... I mean, I love all black people,
"
,,
4,11,"you know.
"
,,
4,11,"I mean, if I could take
"
,,
4,11,"all the black people in the world...
"
,,
4,11,"and just, you know, just buy a farm
"
,,
4,11,"somewhere and let them all...
"
,,
4,11,"Whoa, you know what,
"
,,
4,11,"that actually didn't really come out right.
"
,,
4,11,"Brian, relax. I'm having a great time.
"
,,
4,11,"You don't have to try so hard.
"
,,
4,11,"Great. Great. 'Cause, you know, I'm not
"
,,
4,11,"okay with slavery. Just so we're clear.
"
,,
4,11,"I mean, if I was offered
"
,,
4,11,"a slave, I'd say no.
"
,,
4,11,"By the way, Bonnie...
"
,,
4,11,"we just finished reading
"
,,
4,11,"The Da Vinci Code at my book club.
"
,,
4,11,"You were right. It's terrific.
"
,,
4,11,"Let me guess. Some flowery, 300-page,
"
,,
4,11,"menopausaI masturbatory aid.
"
,,
4,11,"I loved it.
"
,,
4,11,"And the chapters are only
"
,,
4,11,"about two pages long.
"
,,
4,11,"So you feeI really smart when you read it.
"
,,
4,11,"Take it outside, Lois.
"
,,
4,11,"Good night, sweetie.
"
,,
4,11,"Oh, yes. Just as I thought: France, art...
"
,,
4,11,"murder?
"
,,
4,11,"Well, this is a bigger surprise
"
,,
4,11,"than that time Peter vanished into thin air.
"
,,
4,11," Hey, Stewie. Peekaboo!
"
,,
4,11," Yes, I see you, fat man.
"
,,
4,11,"Where's Daddy?
"
,,
4,11,"Where did you go? Oh, this is impossible.
"
,,
4,11,"I can hear you, but I can't see...
"
,,
4,11,"Well, he must really be gone!
"
,,
4,11," Peekaboo!
"
,,
4,11," How the hell did you do that?
"
,,
4,11,"I thought you'd disappeared,
"
,,
4,11,"otherwise I wouldn't have picked my...
"
,,
4,11,"Great, leave when I'm in the middle
"
,,
4,11,"of a sentence.
"
,,
4,11,"Hey, there you are, Brian.
"
,,
4,11,"We're all set for tonight, right?
"
,,
4,11,"Oh, tonight's no good, Peter.
"
,,
4,11,"I have another date with Shauna.
"
,,
4,11,"Oh, come on. Again?
"
,,
4,11,"Well, fine, Brian. If that girI
"
,,
4,11,"is more important to you than me...
"
,,
4,11,"then I guess
"
,,
4,11,"I'll have to find a new best paI.
"
,,
4,11,"Boy, Barney, it's sure been great
"
,,
4,11,"hanging out with you.
"
,,
4,11,"I've enjoyed it, too, Peter.
"
,,
4,11,"Hey, you almost done in the john?
"
,,
4,11,"'Cause we're late for darts.
"
,,
4,11,"all done, Peter.
"
,,
4,11,"You think you have a crap job.
"
,,
4,11,"I don't need Brian to watch TV with.
"
,,
4,11,"I got you, Meg.
"
,,
4,11,"Hey, what's that? What's that?
"
,,
4,11,"Is that a dog?
"
,,
4,11,"Is that another dog on the TV, huh?
"
,,
4,11,"You see that? Go get it. Go get it.
"
,,
4,11,"What's that? Who's that? Who's that?
"
,,
4,11,"Oh! Who's that?
"
,,
4,11,"Who's there?
"
,,
4,11,"Is there somebody at the door?
"
,,
4,11,"Somebody at the door? Huh?
"
,,
4,11,"Somebody at the door?
"
,,
4,11,"What are you gonna do about it?
"
,,
4,11,"What are you gonna do about it?
"
,,
4,11,"What are you...
"
,,
4,11,"I'm not a dog, you fat bastard!
"
,,
4,11,"Wow, Stewie, you're up early.
"
,,
4,11,"I'm up still. I've been reading all night.
"
,,
4,11,"Hang on, Lois. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.
"
,,
4,11,"Well, I loved this book.
"
,,
4,11,"Nothing like a good story
"
,,
4,11,"to recharge your batteries.
"
,,
4,11,"Hey, everybody, check this out.
"
,,
4,11,"This is wonderfuI. Look at this, Peter.
"
,,
4,11,"""Two hundred die in train derallment. ""
"
,,
4,11,"Oh, God, Lois. That is just morbidly obese.
"
,,
4,11,"No, no, Peter. Right here.
"
,,
4,11,"I mentioned to Shauna that they ought to
"
,,
4,11,"change the name of James Woods High...
"
,,
4,11,"to Martin Luther King, Jr.,
"
,,
4,11,"and she really ran with it.
"
,,
4,11,"The schooI board is voting on it tomorrow.
"
,,
4,11,"Congratulations, Brian.
"
,,
4,11,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
"
,,
4,11,"Wait, wait, wait.
"
,,
4,11,"You and your girlfriend are taking the
"
,,
4,11,"name James Woods off the high schooI?
"
,,
4,11," Well, yes. For Martin Luther King.
"
,,
4,11," That's crazy.
"
,,
4,11,"You're gonna name the schooI
"
,,
4,11,"after the star of Space 1999?
"
,,
4,11,"No, that's Martin Landau.
"
,,
4,11," Oh. The guy who played Sheneneh?
"
,,
4,11," That's Martin Lawrence.
"
,,
4,11," The drunk crooner?
"
,,
4,11," That's Dean Martin.
"
,,
4,11," The drink that's best served on the rocks?
"
,,
4,11," Martini & Rossi.
"
,,
4,11," The guy on The West Wing?
"
,,
4,11," Martin Sheen.
"
,,
4,11," The guy from Platoon?
"
,,
4,11," Charlie Sheen.
"
,,
4,11,"No, no, the other guy from Platoon.
"
,,
4,11," It's...
"
,,
4,11," Come on.
"
,,
4,11,"Willem Dafoe.
"
,,
4,11,"No, it's Tom Berenger.
"
,,
4,11,"We were looking for Tom Berenger.
"
,,
4,11,"Well, thanks for playing.
"
,,
4,11,"I'm sorry it didn't work out for you.
"
,,
4,11,"Oh, that's okay. I had a lot of fun.
"
,,
4,11,"I'm a big fan of the show.
"
,,
4,11,"Wait a minute!
"
,,
4,11,"Peter, Martin Luther King was
"
,,
4,11,"an inspiration to an entire generation.
"
,,
4,11,"He was a driving force
"
,,
4,11,"behind the civiI rights movement.
"
,,
4,11,"Lois, we're talking about
"
,,
4,11,"Rhode Island's own James Woods here.
"
,,
4,11,"He's a hero in these parts, huh?
"
,,
4,11,"Use your head.
"
,,
4,11,"Peter, you're acting like an idiot.
"
,,
4,11,"Oh, yeah? I don't like the way
"
,,
4,11,"you've been acting lately.
"
,,
4,11,"I think it has a lot to do
"
,,
4,11,"with that woman...
"
,,
4,11,"you've been spending so much time with.
"
,,
4,11,"Why don't you just mind
"
,,
4,11,"your own damn business, Peter?
"
,,
4,11,"Will you guys stop fighting, please?
"
,,
4,11,"What's wrong with Meg?
"
,,
4,11,"Oh, nothing.
"
,,
4,11,"It's just her time of the month.
"
,,
4,11,"Not again.
"
,,
4,11,"Well, Mr. Griffin, your arguments
"
,,
4,11,"for the schooI's name change...
"
,,
4,11,"are quite compelling.
"
,,
4,11,"Brian, I think you did it.
"
,,
4,11,"Oh, amen.
"
,,
4,11,"By the way,
"
,,
4,11,"I just want to remind everybody...
"
,,
4,11,"to put their e-mall address
"
,,
4,11,"on the list in the back there...
"
,,
4,11,"so we can send you
"
,,
4,11,"our quarterly newsletter.
"
,,
4,11,"It's chock-full of goings-on around
"
,,
4,11,"the schooI. It's got a word jumble.
"
,,
4,11,"A little hint:
"
,,
4,11,"all the answers have to do
"
,,
4,11,"with something here at the schooI.
"
,,
4,11,"Yes, I'm sure
"
,,
4,11,"we're all looking forward to that.
"
,,
4,11,"Now, unless there is any objection,
"
,,
4,11,"I move that the board pass this measure.
"
,,
4,11,"I've got an objection,
"
,,
4,11,"and so does this man.
"
,,
4,11,"James Woods!
"
,,
4,11," Oh, my God.
"
,,
4,11," I don't believe it.
"
,,
4,11,"Hi. How are you? Hello, everyone.
"
,,
4,11,"He brought James Woods here?
"
,,
4,11,"What the hell is he doing?
"
,,
4,11,"Believe me,
"
,,
4,11,"Peter does stupid things all the time.
"
,,
4,11,"That's why he got fired from that airline.
"
,,
4,11," Coffee for you, Capt. Griffin?
"
,,
4,11," Thank you, stewardess.
"
,,
4,11,"Hey, where are we right now?
"
,,
4,11,"On an airplane?
"
,,
4,11,"No. This room. What is this room called?
"
,,
4,11," The flight deck?
"
,,
4,11," No.
"
,,
4,11," ControI room?
"
,,
4,11," No.
"
,,
4,11,"Cockpit?
"
,,
4,11,"Oh, God! I told you I'd get her to say it.
"
,,
4,11,"Oh, God!
"
,,
4,11,"all right. Go on. Get out of here.
"
,,
4,11,"Look, I came as soon as
"
,,
4,11,"Peter contacted my website.
"
,,
4,11,"Let me just say, I'm all in favor
"
,,
4,11,"of renaming the schooI after Dr. King.
"
,,
4,11," What?
"
,,
4,11," Wow!
"
,,
4,11,"A big star and yet so humble.
"
,,
4,11,"James Woods High SchooI it remains.
"
,,
4,11," What?
"
,,
4,11," You can't be serious.
"
,,
4,11,"Yes! This is more exciting than that time
"
,,
4,11,"I got to ride the washing machine.
"
,,
4,11,"Man, what a great lunch, Lois.
"
,,
4,11,"Thank you so much for having me over.
"
,,
4,11,"Well, it's not often
"
,,
4,11,"we get to meet celebrities.
"
,,
4,11,"Yeah, except when I was
"
,,
4,11,"Christina Aguilera's manager.
"
,,
4,11,"Okay, let me just go ahead and stop you
"
,,
4,11,"right there. You sound terrible, all right?
"
,,
4,11,"You're doing this thing, which is just,
"
,,
4,11,"you know... What the hell is that?
"
,,
4,11,"And you look like if I touched you,
"
,,
4,11,"you'd be sticky...
"
,,
4,11,"and frankly, you smell bad.
"
,,
4,11,"You're pretty much offensive
"
,,
4,11,"to all five senses.
"
,,
4,11,"That's only four.
"
,,
4,11,"Well, actually, you know when you smell
"
,,
4,11,"something and it gets stuck in there...
"
,,
4,11,"and you can sort of taste it?
"
,,
4,11,"Yeah. Well, I'm tasting you right now
"
,,
4,11,"and it tastes awfuI.
"
,,
4,11,"Truly disgusting, like salty garbage.
"
,,
4,11,"Yeah, I totally taste it.
"
,,
4,11,"Oh, Brian, there you are.
"
,,
4,11,"Look who's here for lunch.
"
,,
4,11,"Hello, Mr. Woods.
"
,,
4,11,"Peter tells me you're in films.
"
,,
4,11,"Peter, can I talk to you in the living room?
"
,,
4,11,"I can't believe you went
"
,,
4,11,"to that much effort just to sabotage me.
"
,,
4,11,"You're a jerk, you know that?
"
,,
4,11,"Listen, at least I wasn't trying to change
"
,,
4,11,"the name of the schooI...
"
,,
4,11,"to impress my girlfriend.
"
,,
4,11,"Now that is not true.
"
,,
4,11,"Oh, yeah?
"
,,
4,11,"Then why did you pick Martin Luther King?
"
,,
4,11,"Why not Ronald Reagan?
"
,,
4,11,"He was always fun,
"
,,
4,11,"especially in his later years.
"
,,
4,11,"Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.
"
,,
4,11,"Tear it down.
"
,,
4,11,"Reagan smash. Reagan smash.
"
,,
4,11,"What's that?
"
,,
4,11,"Oh, it's just Reagan.
"
,,
4,11,"Just leave him alone. He'll tire himself out.
"
,,
4,11,"Reagan sleepy.
"
,,
4,11,"You're an ass, you know that?
"
,,
4,11,"You're just jealous because
"
,,
4,11,"I'm hanging around with someone else.
"
,,
4,11,"Hey, I don't care, man.
"
,,
4,11,"Girls are stupid anyway.
"
,,
4,11,"Well, fine.
"
,,
4,11,"Then maybe I'll go see her right now.
"
,,
4,11,"Fine! I'll just hang out with James Woods.
"
,,
4,11,"Well, Peter, thanks for lunch.
"
,,
4,11," Guess I'll be heading back to old L.A. now.
"
,,
4,11," You're leaving?
"
,,
4,11,"Oh, man, I thought maybe
"
,,
4,11,"you could stick around...
"
,,
4,11,"and, you know,
"
,,
4,11,"maybe you and me could be pals.
"
,,
4,11,"You mean just hang around
"
,,
4,11,"like regular people.
"
,,
4,11,"Regular people, sure, yeah.
"
,,
4,11,"That does sound appeallng.
"
,,
4,11,"You know what?
"
,,
4,11,"I'm gonna check back into my hoteI.
"
,,
4,11,"Oh, screw that.
"
,,
4,11,"You'll stay with me right here.
"
,,
4,11,"Come on,
"
,,
4,11,"we'll have a campout in the yard.
"
,,
4,11,"Wicked cooI.
"
,,
4,11,"His sweater was neatly folded
"
,,
4,11,"on the grave...
"
,,
4,11,"so we went back to the car...
"
,,
4,11,"and the severed hook was hanging
"
,,
4,11,"from the door handle...
"
,,
4,11,"because the calls were coming
"
,,
4,11,"from inside the house.
"
,,
4,11,"That's a scary story, Peter.
"
,,
4,11,"It's almost as scary as... boo!
"
,,
4,11,"Boy, James Woods, you're the best friend
"
,,
4,11,"a guy could ever have.
"
,,
4,11,"I feeI the same way about you, Peter.
"
,,
4,11,"Someone to care for
"
,,
4,11,"To be there for
"
,,
4,11,"I have James Woods
"
,,
4,11,"Someone to do for
"
,,
4,11,"Muddle through for
"
,,
4,11,"You have James Woods
"
,,
4,11,"Someone to share joy
"
,,
4,11,"Or despair with
"
,,
4,11,"Whichever betides you
"
,,
4,11,"Life becomes a chore
"
,,
4,11,"Unless you're living for
"
,,
4,11,"Someone to tend to
"
,,
4,11,"Be a friend to
"
,,
4,11,"I have James Woods
"
,,
4,11,"Someone to strive for
"
,,
4,11,"Do or die for
"
,,
4,11,"You have James Woods
"
,,
4,11,"It's true
"
,,
4,11,"We two
"
,,
4,11,"Have a likewise point of view
"
,,
4,11,"'Cause James Woods
"
,,
4,11,"has you
"
,,
4,11,"And I have James Woods
"
,,
4,11,"too
"
,,
4,11," Shauna?
"
,,
4,11," Brian, over here.
"
,,
4,11,"I couldn't save your seat.
"
,,
4,11,"I know I'm late, I apologize.
"
,,
4,11," Hello, fellow moviegoer.
"
,,
4,11," Sorry, I couldn't get him to move.
"
,,
4,11," Where have you been?
"
,,
4,11," I just had it out with Peter.
"
,,
4,11,"Would you like some corn?
"
,,
4,11,"I brought it from home.
"
,,
4,11,"Peter? You're still not friends
"
,,
4,11,"with that idiot after what he did?
"
,,
4,11,"Well, I mean, that may be a little harsh.
"
,,
4,11,"I'm not going to avoid Peter
"
,,
4,11,"like the drunk chick at a party.
"
,,
4,11,"I just smoked the wrong side
"
,,
4,11,"of a cigarette!
"
,,
4,11,"Who wants to go swimming?
"
,,
4,11,"This song is about me!
"
,,
4,11,"Look, Brian, Peter is a jerk.
"
,,
4,11,"And as far as I'm concerned,
"
,,
4,11,"it's either him or me.
"
,,
4,11,"Shauna, come on, why you want
"
,,
4,11,"to play a brother like that?
"
,,
4,11,"I think I have my answer.
"
,,
4,11,"You know what? I will have some of that.
"
,,
4,11," What the hell is this?
"
,,
4,11," Creamed corn.
"
,,
4,11,"I brought it from home, because I don't
"
,,
4,11,"like the creamed corn they have here.
"
,,
4,11,"It's too crunchy.
"
,,
4,11,"Peter, I'm sorry, I was a jerk.
"
,,
4,11,"Let's be friends again. Okay.
"
,,
4,11," Peter, can I talk to you for a second?
"
,,
4,11," What is it, Brian?
"
,,
4,11,"Listen, I'm sorry for everything
"
,,
4,11,"that's happened between us...
"
,,
4,11,"and I figure, I don't know, I thought
"
,,
4,11,"maybe we could be friends again, huh?
"
,,
4,11,"What do you say? I kind of miss
"
,,
4,11,"sleeping at the foot of your bed.
"
,,
4,11," I don't think so.
"
,,
4,11," Come on, can't we just go...
"
,,
4,11," I tried to tell you.
"
,,
4,11," This is my spot now, Brian.
"
,,
4,11,"Oh. I see.
"
,,
4,11,"Look, Lois. Lois, look, look, look.
"
,,
4,11,"He's dreaming he's running.
"
,,
4,11,"Okay, James, you ready?
"
,,
4,11,"Now catch it in your mouth like Brian.
"
,,
4,11," James, you got to bite down.
"
,,
4,11," I got a question, Peter.
"
,,
4,11,"Motivation. What is my motivation?
"
,,
4,11,"Just throw it back to me.
"
,,
4,11,"You know what? This is boring.
"
,,
4,11,"I got a better idea.
"
,,
4,11,"James, do we really
"
,,
4,11,"have to watch Videodrome?
"
,,
4,11,"Yeah, I think you're really
"
,,
4,11,"going to appreciate...
"
,,
4,11,"all the subtle nuances in my performance.
"
,,
4,11,"See? For example, see how even though
"
,,
4,11,"this other guy is talking...
"
,,
4,11,"your eye is drawn to me.
"
,,
4,11,"Yeah, that's neat.
"
,,
4,11," Is there going to be any nudity?
"
,,
4,11," Yes, I get naked.
"
,,
4,11,"You know, it's bad enough
"
,,
4,11,"that Peter and I were fighting...
"
,,
4,11,"but ever since he met James Woods,
"
,,
4,11,"it's like I don't even exist.
"
,,
4,11,"Do you really care about a man
"
,,
4,11,"who used to try and pick up girls...
"
,,
4,11,"at the Miss USA Pageant?
"
,,
4,11,"Hey, how's it going? I'm Peter.
"
,,
4,11,"You want to go out sometime?
"
,,
4,11,"Maybe you got a Saturday night free...
"
,,
4,11,"You know what? To hell with you, then.
"
,,
4,11,"Yeah, go to hell.
"
,,
4,11,"I'm Peter. What do you say you and me go
"
,,
4,11,"get a couple of beers, maybe we could...
"
,,
4,11,"Fine. You know what?
"
,,
4,11,"You got mosquito-bite boobs anyway.
"
,,
4,11,"I don't care. I don't care. I don't need you.
"
,,
4,11,"Hey, how are you? I'm Peter.
"
,,
4,11,"I got a coupon for Sizzler
"
,,
4,11,"with your name on it.
"
,,
4,11,"Maybe the two of us could...
"
,,
4,11,"You know what? I don't care.
"
,,
4,11,"You're a bitch.
"
,,
4,11,"Brian, I know you're upset now, but if
"
,,
4,11,"there's anything I've learned in this life...
"
,,
4,11,"is that you can't let the little things...
"
,,
4,11,"Hey! Hey!
"
,,
4,11,"Where's my money?
"
,,
4,11,"Don't you walk out on me!
"
,,
4,11,"Hey.
"
,,
4,11,"Hey.
"
,,
4,11,"So where's your good buddy,
"
,,
4,11,"James Woods?
"
,,
4,11,"Turns out he wasn't very good
"
,,
4,11,"at catching stuff with his mouth.
"
,,
4,11," Where's your girlfriend?
"
,,
4,11," Same problem.
"
,,
4,11,"James, what are
"
,,
4,11,"you doing here?
"
,,
4,11," What's going on?
"
,,
4,11," Hello, Peter.
"
,,
4,11,"Would you like some cold roast beef?
"
,,
4,11,"What do you mean?
"
,,
4,11,"I don't know, Peter, I had this crazy idea...
"
,,
4,11,"that you and I were supposed to
"
,,
4,11,"have dinner tonight.
"
,,
4,11,"But I guess you had other plans, huh?
"
,,
4,11,"Brian and I were just at The Clam.
"
,,
4,11,"Oh, that's fun.
"
,,
4,11,"That sounds like you had a fun time.
"
,,
4,11,"And where would I fit in with the fun time?
"
,,
4,11,"Where does James Woods fit into
"
,,
4,11,"the fun, you...?
"
,,
4,11,"Look, James, you're acting kind of weird.
"
,,
4,11,"I'll act however I want to act,
"
,,
4,11,"you son of a bitch!
"
,,
4,11,"I'm sorry, Peter, I didn't mean that.
"
,,
4,11,"Boy, I haven't been this creeped out
"
,,
4,11,"since I saw that episode of Star Trek.
"
,,
4,11," Number One.
"
,,
4,11," Yes, Captain.
"
,,
4,11,"Let me ask you something.
"
,,
4,11,"If I whispered in your ear
"
,,
4,11,"that Commander Worf's head...
"
,,
4,11,"looks like a fanny,
"
,,
4,11,"would you join me in a laugh?
"
,,
4,11," Yeah, I could get in on that.
"
,,
4,11," all right!
"
,,
4,11,"Here it comes!
"
,,
4,11,"Commander Worf's head
"
,,
4,11,"looks like a fanny!
"
,,
4,11," You can both suck my ridges.
"
,,
4,11," Get a sense of humor, Rocky Dennis.
"
,,
4,11,"Boy, I tell you, Brian, James Woods
"
,,
4,11,"has been getting kind of obsessive...
"
,,
4,11,"ever since you and me
"
,,
4,11,"started hanging out again.
"
,,
4,11,"How are you going to handle that?
"
,,
4,11,"We got to come up with some crazy
"
,,
4,11,"scheme like the kids on That '70s Show.
"
,,
4,11,"And I think I got it.
"
,,
4,11,"all right,
"
,,
4,11,"that's the last of the Reese's Pieces.
"
,,
4,11,"Good. Now we wait.
"
,,
4,11,"Peter? A piece of candy!
"
,,
4,11,"A piece of candy!
"
,,
4,11,"A piece of candy!
"
,,
4,11,"A piece of candy!
"
,,
4,11,"A piece of candy!
"
,,
4,11,"A piece of candy!
"
,,
4,11,"A piece of candy!
"
,,
4,11,"A piece of candy!
"
,,
4,11,"A piece of candy!
"
,,
4,11,"A piece of candy!
"
,,
4,11,"A piece of candy!
"
,,
4,11,"A piece of candy!
"
,,
4,11,"A piece of candy!
"
,,
4,11,"Man, I hope that's James Woods.
"
,,
4,11,"'Cause if it's me under there again,
"
,,
4,11,"I'm gonna be really pissed off.
"
,,
4,11,"It's good to have you back
"
,,
4,11,"in that spot, Brian.
"
,,
4,11,"It's good to be back, Peter.
"
,,
4,11,"By the way, what did you end up doing
"
,,
4,11,"with James Woods?
"
,,
4,11,"Don't worry, Brian.
"
,,
4,11,"He's being examined by top men.
"
,,
4,11," Who?
"
,,
4,11," Top men.
"
,,
4,12,"It seems today that all you see
"
,,
4,12,"Is violence in movies and sex on TV
"
,,
4,12,"But where are those
"
,,
4,12,"good old-fashioned values
"
,,
4,12,"On which we used to rely?
"
,,
4,12,"Lucky there's a family guy
"
,,
4,12,"Lucky there's a man who
"
,,
4,12,"Positively can do
"
,,
4,12,"all the things that make us
"
,,
4,12,"Laugh and cry
"
,,
4,12,"He's a family guy
"
,,
4,12,"all right, boys. Let's see what we've got.
"
,,
4,12,"Well, at least we got something.
"
,,
4,12,"God! Damn! Stupid penguins.
"
,,
4,12,"Sorry, guys,
"
,,
4,12,"but the way things have been going...
"
,,
4,12,"I can't afford to keep you.
"
,,
4,12,"I'm gonna have to put you down.
"
,,
4,12,"This is the hardest thing
"
,,
4,12,"I've ever had to do.
"
,,
4,12,"I love you both. So, sorry.
"
,,
4,12,"I'll always love you.
"
,,
4,12,"We now return
"
,,
4,12,"to Gilmore Girls.
"
,,
4,12,"Mom, I need to talk to you about Dean.
"
,,
4,12,"Which Dean? Howard Dean, James Dean
"
,,
4,12,"or Jimmy Dean.
"
,,
4,12,"Too old, too dead, and too fattening.
"
,,
4,12,"You don't have to tell that to my thighs.
"
,,
4,12,"Can you ask your thighs
"
,,
4,12,"if they borrowed my Gap capris?
"
,,
4,12,"They did not and are insulted
"
,,
4,12,"that you've asked such a thing.
"
,,
4,12,"As insulted as Kitty Kelley...
"
,,
4,12,"when people accuse her of taking
"
,,
4,12,"liberties with her best-selling tell-alls.
"
,,
4,12," Almost. Wanna make out?
"
,,
4,12," Absolutely not.
"
,,
4,12," Oh, you're so Iying.
"
,,
4,12," I so am.
"
,,
4,12,"Oh, honey, how was your day?
"
,,
4,12,"Did you catch any fish?
"
,,
4,12,"No, but I caught this turtle.
"
,,
4,12,"Named him Terence.
"
,,
4,12,"Then killed him, and hollowed him out
"
,,
4,12,"into an ashtray for Stewie.
"
,,
4,12,"Peter, we have a family to feed.
"
,,
4,12,"We all count on you to provide for us.
"
,,
4,12,"I know, and I feeI terrible.
"
,,
4,12,"I must look like a bigger loser
"
,,
4,12,"than when I was on that game show.
"
,,
4,12,"And now, back to America's
"
,,
4,12,"favorite game show...
"
,,
4,12,"Bobcat or Bjork.
"
,,
4,12,"Okay, Peter. Listen closely and tell us...
"
,,
4,12,"if this is a song
"
,,
4,12,"by Icelandic vocallst Bjork...
"
,,
4,12,"or, the rantings of former comedian
"
,,
4,12,"Bobcat Goldthwait.
"
,,
4,12,"Here we go.
"
,,
4,12,"Well, Bill, that's gotta be Bobcat.
"
,,
4,12,"Sorry, that was Bjork.
"
,,
4,12,"I tell you, fellows,
"
,,
4,12,"if I don't find some fish out there soon...
"
,,
4,12,"my family's gonna go hungry.
"
,,
4,12,"If it's fish you wants, Pelican's Reef
"
,,
4,12,"is where you'll find them.
"
,,
4,12,"I've seen fish there.
"
,,
4,12,"More fish than you could possibly imagine.
"
,,
4,12,"Fish as far as the eye can see.
"
,,
4,12,"Lots and lots of fish...
"
,,
4,12,"I guess, would be the main bullet point
"
,,
4,12,"of this presentation.
"
,,
4,12,"Jeez, where is this Pelican's Reef?
"
,,
4,12,"There.
"
,,
4,12,"But beware, no man has ever returned.
"
,,
4,12,"Many have gone. all have been lost.
"
,,
4,12,"Vanished, never to be seen again.
"
,,
4,12,"No one has ever come back...
"
,,
4,12,"I guess, would be the centraI theme
"
,,
4,12,"of what I'm trying to get across here.
"
,,
4,12,"Pelican's Reef, huh?
"
,,
4,12,"Then, that's where I'll go.
"
,,
4,12,"'Cause I'm not afraid of a challenge.
"
,,
4,12,"Like that time I outfarted MichaeI Moore.
"
,,
4,12," Hi, there.
"
,,
4,12," How are you doing?
"
,,
4,12,"all right, everybody. I'll be back in a week.
"
,,
4,12," Brian, look after the family.
"
,,
4,12," Aye, aye.
"
,,
4,12," Chris, don't pick your bum.
"
,,
4,12," No promises.
"
,,
4,12,"Meg, if you get intimate with a guy,
"
,,
4,12,"make him wear this.
"
,,
4,12,"Dad, that's a garbage bag.
"
,,
4,12,"Don't you mean a condom?
"
,,
4,12,"Meg, hefty, hefty, hefty.
"
,,
4,12,"Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy.
"
,,
4,12,"Honey, be carefuI.
"
,,
4,12,"This Pelican's Reef sounds dangerous.
"
,,
4,12,"That's why I built you
"
,,
4,12,"a widow's walk, Lois.
"
,,
4,12,"So you can watch the sea untiI I return.
"
,,
4,12,"Go on, try it out.
"
,,
4,12," Peter, that doesn't look entirely-
"
,,
4,12," Go on!
"
,,
4,12,"Peter, I'm really not comfortable,
"
,,
4,12,"stepping foot on this-
"
,,
4,12,"Lois, I gotta leave in, like, five minutes.
"
,,
4,12,"Is this scotch tape?
"
,,
4,12,"You drunk.
"
,,
4,12,"Boy, I really appreciate you guys
"
,,
4,12,"helping me out on this.
"
,,
4,12,"Peter, we're your friends. We're always
"
,,
4,12,"there for you in your time of need.
"
,,
4,12,"Especially when you provide the free beer.
"
,,
4,12,"Hey, I got an idea. Let's play ""I never"".
"
,,
4,12,"You gotta drink if you did the thing
"
,,
4,12,"that the person says they never did.
"
,,
4,12,"Well, I got one.
"
,,
4,12,"I never slept with a woman
"
,,
4,12,"with the lights on.
"
,,
4,12,"I'll go next.
"
,,
4,12,"I never had sex with Cleveland's wife.
"
,,
4,12,"all right, let's see.
"
,,
4,12,"I never did a chick
"
,,
4,12,"in a Logan airport bathroom.
"
,,
4,12,"God, let's see. What else is there?
"
,,
4,12,"I never gave a reach around
"
,,
4,12,"to a spider monkey...
"
,,
4,12,"while reciting the pledge of allegiance.
"
,,
4,12,"Oh, God.
"
,,
4,12,"I never picked up an illegaI allen
"
,,
4,12,"at Home Depot...
"
,,
4,12,"to take home and choke me,
"
,,
4,12,"while I touched myself.
"
,,
4,12,"Oh, come on.
"
,,
4,12,"I never did the same thing
"
,,
4,12,"but with someone from Jo-Ann Fabrics.
"
,,
4,12,"Oh, God, this is ridiculous.
"
,,
4,12,"Oh, boy. He's out cold.
"
,,
4,12,"Hey, let's write on him.
"
,,
4,12,"What the hell is that?
"
,,
4,12,"Oh, my God. There's fish everywhere.
"
,,
4,12," Wow! This must be Pelican's Reef.
"
,,
4,12," Holy crap! We're rich!
"
,,
4,12,"Rich? I'll tell you what's rich.
"
,,
4,12,"The amusing folksy monologues
"
,,
4,12,"of young Will Rogers.
"
,,
4,12,"But me, I like the visuaI slapstick gag.
"
,,
4,12,"Like this comically oversized powder puff.
"
,,
4,12,"Makeup. Now, that's rich.
"
,,
4,12,"Play me off, Johnny.
"
,,
4,12,"In locaI news, we have more on the
"
,,
4,12,"approach of Hurricane RuPauI...
"
,,
4,12,"which is working his or her
"
,,
4,12,"way up the coast.
"
,,
4,12,"Let's go live to Ollie Williams
"
,,
4,12,"with the blackie weather report.
"
,,
4,12," Ollie.
"
,,
4,12," It's raining sideways.
"
,,
4,12,"Sounds rough, Ollie.
"
,,
4,12,"You have an umbrella?
"
,,
4,12,"Had one.
"
,,
4,12," Where is it?
"
,,
4,12," Inside out, two miles away.
"
,,
4,12," Is there anything we can do for you?
"
,,
4,12," Bring me some soup.
"
,,
4,12," What kind?
"
,,
4,12," Turkey.
"
,,
4,12,"all right, we'll get on that.
"
,,
4,12,"Coming up next,
"
,,
4,12,"a pig who refuses to eat Jews.
"
,,
4,12,"After this.
"
,,
4,12,"A hurricane. Oh, my God!
"
,,
4,12,"Peter's out there.
"
,,
4,12,"Don't worry, Lois.
"
,,
4,12,"Peter's good at getting out of trouble.
"
,,
4,12,"Just like Kobe Bryant.
"
,,
4,12,"We want the truth, Kobe.
"
,,
4,12,"Did you rape her?
"
,,
4,12,"What were we talking about?
"
,,
4,12," That's a hell of a catch, Peter.
"
,,
4,12," Guys, this is great.
"
,,
4,12,"Not only will I be able to put food
"
,,
4,12,"on the table, and pay all my bills...
"
,,
4,12,"I'll also be able to finance
"
,,
4,12,"my Christmas album.
"
,,
4,12,"Sessions presents,
"
,,
4,12,"a Peter Griffin Christmas.
"
,,
4,12,"Featuring such standards as...
"
,,
4,12,"Everybody, look at the snow
"
,,
4,12,"in the yard
"
,,
4,12,"And who could forget...
"
,,
4,12,"I brought these gifts for you
"
,,
4,12,"They're up in my bum
"
,,
4,12,"And everyone's favorite...
"
,,
4,12,"Look at the bells, look at the bells
"
,,
4,12,"Holy crap, here come Jesus
"
,,
4,12,"And he doesn't look too happy
"
,,
4,12,"Merry Christmas, everyone.
"
,,
4,12,"Here's to fish.
"
,,
4,12,"Hey, could I have one of those?
"
,,
4,12,"Hey, Death, what are you doing here?
"
,,
4,12,"Me? I'm here because of that.
"
,,
4,12,"And their vesseI was swept to the bottom
"
,,
4,12,"of the briny deep.
"
,,
4,12,"Swallowed whole
"
,,
4,12,"by the treacherous, unforgiving sea.
"
,,
4,12,"They sank, I guess,
"
,,
4,12,"would be the one thing...
"
,,
4,12,"to take away
"
,,
4,12,"from this part of the seminar.
"
,,
4,12,"When we come back, I'll show you...
"
,,
4,12,"how eye contact can make or break
"
,,
4,12,"any business relationship.
"
,,
4,12,"It's lucky you packed
"
,,
4,12,"so many blow-up dolls...
"
,,
4,12,"Quag, Quagmire.
"
,,
4,12,"Be carefuI.
"
,,
4,12,"The tiniest prick will pop these things.
"
,,
4,12,"Giggidy.
"
,,
4,12,"We've been out here for days. I'm starving.
"
,,
4,12," Hey, what's that?
"
,,
4,12," Where? What?
"
,,
4,12,"You're eating something.
"
,,
4,12," You bastard! You have food?
"
,,
4,12," I don't know what you're talking about.
"
,,
4,12,"Give me that.
"
,,
4,12,"Peter! You've been eating my legs?
"
,,
4,12,"Yeah.
"
,,
4,12,"See, now this is why I didn't say anything.
"
,,
4,12," I knew you were gonna get like this.
"
,,
4,12," What the hell is wrong with you?
"
,,
4,12," Look, Joe-
"
,,
4,12," You've been eating me!
"
,,
4,12,"Okay, you know what.
"
,,
4,12,"Let's just agree to disagree.
"
,,
4,12,"Hey, guys. There's an island.
"
,,
4,12,"Oh, thank goodness.
"
,,
4,12,"Oh, wow. I feeI like an explorer.
"
,,
4,12,"Just like my ancestor,
"
,,
4,12,"Ponce de Leon Griffin.
"
,,
4,12,"There it is boys, the Fountain of Youth.
"
,,
4,12,"Just like I told you.
"
,,
4,12,"Well, that was worth
"
,,
4,12,"the eight-year boat ride.
"
,,
4,12,"We gather today to remember
"
,,
4,12,"those brave Quahog men...
"
,,
4,12,"who were lost at sea.
"
,,
4,12,"The Bible declares an eye for an eye.
"
,,
4,12,"So, let us now take our vengeance
"
,,
4,12,"on this murderous ocean.
"
,,
4,12,"You won't be hurting anyone anymore.
"
,,
4,12," I just can't believe he's gone.
"
,,
4,12," Don't worry, Lois. We'll get through this.
"
,,
4,12,"Daddy, I'm gonna miss you.
"
,,
4,12,"Daddy!
"
,,
4,12,"Oh, he's dead.
"
,,
4,12,"I know, sweetie. I'm sad, too.
"
,,
4,12,"But you're making a scene.
"
,,
4,12,"all our friends are here.
"
,,
4,12,"Screw you, fish.
"
,,
4,12,"I miss you so much.
"
,,
4,12,"But I promise, one day I'll see you again,
"
,,
4,12,"Captain Caveman.
"
,,
4,12,"It feels like we've been here forever.
"
,,
4,12,"Okay, here's one.
"
,,
4,12,"What would you guys rather be?
"
,,
4,12,"Blind or a midget?
"
,,
4,12,"Oh, that's easy. Blind.
"
,,
4,12,"It heightens your other senses
"
,,
4,12,"to near superhero levels.
"
,,
4,12,"Yeah, and every woman I did
"
,,
4,12,"would be CheryI Tiegs.
"
,,
4,12,"Definitely blind.
"
,,
4,12,"You guys are crazy.
"
,,
4,12,"Hey, you don't wanna be a midget?
"
,,
4,12,"One of those funny little guys
"
,,
4,12,"running around...
"
,,
4,12,"getting in all kinds of shenanigans.
"
,,
4,12,"Smoking a cigar,
"
,,
4,12,"while you're riding around in a stroller.
"
,,
4,12," Good point.
"
,,
4,12," Never thought of it that way.
"
,,
4,12," They are God's little punch lines.
"
,,
4,12," Okay, all right. Here's another one.
"
,,
4,12,"Black or crippled?
"
,,
4,12,"all right, fellas.
"
,,
4,12,"We've been out here for months.
"
,,
4,12,"And we all know
"
,,
4,12,"that men have certain needs.
"
,,
4,12,"And being there's no women around,
"
,,
4,12,"we're gonna have to have an orgy.
"
,,
4,12," Anybody horny?
"
,,
4,12," No.
"
,,
4,12," No.
"
,,
4,12," Yeah, me neither.
"
,,
4,12,"And whoever's toe that is,
"
,,
4,12,"I appreciate your enthusiasm...
"
,,
4,12,"but I think, you can stop.
"
,,
4,12,"Boy, I'm sure glad
"
,,
4,12,"nobody's here to see this.
"
,,
4,12,"And if you look off
"
,,
4,12,"the left side of the ship...
"
,,
4,12,"you'll see a bunch of homosexuals.
"
,,
4,12," That was a great cruise.
"
,,
4,12," Yeah, the buffet was great.
"
,,
4,12,"And I enjoyed shooting Skeet.
"
,,
4,12,"Don't worry, Mr. Ulrich,
"
,,
4,12,"we'll get you to the hospitaI.
"
,,
4,12,"You bastard.
"
,,
4,12,"There's nothing good about
"
,,
4,12,"what you do or who you are.
"
,,
4,12,"Lois, I'm home.
"
,,
4,12," Peter.
"
,,
4,12," Daddy.
"
,,
4,12," Dad.
"
,,
4,12," What's your name again?
"
,,
4,12,"I wanna say allen.
"
,,
4,12," Oh, it's so good to see you guys.
"
,,
4,12," Peter, we'd given up hope.
"
,,
4,12,"I can't tell you how happy I am
"
,,
4,12,"that you're allve.
"
,,
4,12,"Oh, come here, sweetheart.
"
,,
4,12,"Wait, Peter.
"
,,
4,12,"There's something you should know.
"
,,
4,12,"I'm not quite sure how to tell you this,
"
,,
4,12,"but I got remarried.
"
,,
4,12,"What?
"
,,
4,12,"It was a very difficult time
"
,,
4,12,"and he was there for us.
"
,,
4,12,"What the hell... Who was there for you?
"
,,
4,12,"Honey, I'm home.
"
,,
4,12," Peter, you're allve.
"
,,
4,12," Brian.
"
,,
4,12,"This is just like that sitcom
"
,,
4,12,"where there's two dads.
"
,,
4,12,"Except nobody's laughing.
"
,,
4,12,"No, wait, it's the same.
"
,,
4,12,"You married Brian?
"
,,
4,12,"Peter, remember.
"
,,
4,12,"We thought you were dead.
"
,,
4,12,"I needed help and Brian was there.
"
,,
4,12,"He even took a job selling cars
"
,,
4,12,"to keep the family afloat.
"
,,
4,12,"Well, just get a divorce
"
,,
4,12,"and everything will be back to normaI.
"
,,
4,12,"It's not that easy.
"
,,
4,12,"What am I supposed to tell Brian?
"
,,
4,12,"Thanks for saving our family, now scram.
"
,,
4,12,"And besides, he's been great with the kids.
"
,,
4,12,"I mean, Chris is doing better in schooI.
"
,,
4,12,"And Meg even went on a date with
"
,,
4,12,"the announcer from the Super Friends.
"
,,
4,12,"Meanwhile, under Meg Griffin's bra.
"
,,
4,12,"Fine. I can see, I'm not wanted here.
"
,,
4,12,"Maybe I'll just find my own place.
"
,,
4,12,"Oh, Peter. I just feeI terrible about this.
"
,,
4,12,"I don't need your sympathy.
"
,,
4,12,"I don't need anything.
"
,,
4,12,"You know what?
"
,,
4,12,"Maybe I'll just go take up my old job...
"
,,
4,12,"as a construction worker in New York.
"
,,
4,12,"Although I never did get
"
,,
4,12,"the cat calling right.
"
,,
4,12," Yeah, baby.
"
,,
4,12," I want a piece of that.
"
,,
4,12,"You suck!
"
,,
4,12,"Hey, listen, Lois.
"
,,
4,12,"You know, I know,
"
,,
4,12,"your head must be turned upside down...
"
,,
4,12,"by this whole Peter thing.
"
,,
4,12,"So, you know, if there's anything
"
,,
4,12,"you wanna talk about...
"
,,
4,12,"Oh, don't worry, Brian.
"
,,
4,12,"I'll admit this is an emotionaI time for me
"
,,
4,12,"but you and I are married...
"
,,
4,12,"and that's the way it's gonna stay.
"
,,
4,12,"So any possibility of...
"
,,
4,12,"tonight being the night
"
,,
4,12,"we finally push the beds together.
"
,,
4,12,"Good night, Brian.
"
,,
4,12,"Come on.
"
,,
4,12,"Jeez, enough with that already.
"
,,
4,12,"You're like a dog with a bone.
"
,,
4,12,"Tell me about it. I'll be in the basement.
"
,,
4,12," Doing what?
"
,,
4,12," What do you think?
"
,,
4,12,"Wow, Joe,
"
,,
4,12,"where did you get the new legs?
"
,,
4,12,"Transplant. They belonged to
"
,,
4,12,"a death row inmate who got the chair.
"
,,
4,12,"Unfortunately for me,
"
,,
4,12,"he was also a paraplegic.
"
,,
4,12,"Guys, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
"
,,
4,12,"Lois is the only woman for me.
"
,,
4,12,"Well, then, it sounds like you've gotta
"
,,
4,12,"find a way to win her back.
"
,,
4,12,"Yeah, like we could get her drunk
"
,,
4,12,"and take turns having sex with her.
"
,,
4,12," How would that help me?
"
,,
4,12," Oh, help you?
"
,,
4,12,"Yeah, yeah. Then, no.
"
,,
4,12,"No, then, that wouldn't help you.
"
,,
4,12,"Well, Joe is absolutely right.
"
,,
4,12,"I just gotta figure out
"
,,
4,12,"a way to win Lois back.
"
,,
4,12,"I can do that, I'm a smart guy.
"
,,
4,12,"I once built that time machine out of a
"
,,
4,12,"DeLorean.
"
,,
4,12,"all right, past. Here I come.
"
,,
4,12,"Wow. Everybody in 1955 was on fire.
"
,,
4,12,"I never knew that.
"
,,
4,12," Oh, hello, Lois.
"
,,
4,12," Peter.
"
,,
4,12,"What are you doing here
"
,,
4,12,"and where are your clothes?
"
,,
4,12,"Oh, did I forget my clothes?
"
,,
4,12,"You know, I'd leave my ass behind...
"
,,
4,12,"if it wasn't so perfectly attached
"
,,
4,12,"to my sternum.
"
,,
4,12,"Perhaps I should cover myself.
"
,,
4,12,"Look, Peter,
"
,,
4,12,"I know what you're trying to do...
"
,,
4,12,"but it's not gonna work.
"
,,
4,12,"I'm married to Brian.
"
,,
4,12,"Oh, that's right. How inappropriate of me.
"
,,
4,12,"Well, I guess, I should be going.
"
,,
4,12," Lois, do you have a magnet in your head?
"
,,
4,12," What?
"
,,
4,12,"You must, because it's attracting
"
,,
4,12,"my buns of steeI.
"
,,
4,12,"Peter, knock it off.
"
,,
4,12,"You knock it off.
"
,,
4,12,"You're the one with the magnet.
"
,,
4,12,"I'm serious, knock it off.
"
,,
4,12,"Peter, no.
"
,,
4,12,"Peter, for God's sake.
"
,,
4,12,"Oh, who am I kidding?
"
,,
4,12,"I can't fight this anymore.
"
,,
4,12,"I missed you so much.
"
,,
4,12,"Lois, I smell whipped cream.
"
,,
4,12,"Are you making strawberry shortcake?
"
,,
4,12,"So it's a shouting match you want, eh?
"
,,
4,12,"Well, game on, Quahog.
"
,,
4,12,"I'm beating you!
"
,,
4,12,"Hey, Griffin, your sales are in the toilet.
"
,,
4,12,"You got problems at home?
"
,,
4,12,"No! What would make you say that?
"
,,
4,12,"Ex-husband back in the picture,
"
,,
4,12,"you're working during the day.
"
,,
4,12,"They got time to bump uglies.
"
,,
4,12,"That's right, I said, bump uglies.
"
,,
4,12,"Big whoop. Want to fight about it?
"
,,
4,12,"Shut up, Paddy, you're crazy.
"
,,
4,12,"Lois would never cheat on me.
"
,,
4,12,"I trust her completely.
"
,,
4,12,"Excuse me.
"
,,
4,12,"I'm looking for a car that's been
"
,,
4,12,"tricked out to look like an ice-cream truck.
"
,,
4,12,"Damn it! I'm sorry, what?
"
,,
4,12,"You know, with colorfuI pictures
"
,,
4,12,"of ice cream treats.
"
,,
4,12,"And it plays a tune
"
,,
4,12,"that's fun for the young children.
"
,,
4,12,"Okay, I'm going out.
"
,,
4,12," Where are you going?
"
,,
4,12," To my garden club.
"
,,
4,12,"It's 10:30 at night and you have a saddle.
"
,,
4,12,"Well, it's a...
"
,,
4,12,"What's this? What's this, Brian, huh?
"
,,
4,12,"What's this, huh?
"
,,
4,12," It's a ball.
"
,,
4,12," Oh, is this your ball?
"
,,
4,12,"You want it, huh? You want this, huh?
"
,,
4,12,"Yes, I would like it, please, yes.
"
,,
4,12,"You want this, huh? You want the ball?
"
,,
4,12," Yes, I would like to have it very much.
"
,,
4,12," You want the ball?
"
,,
4,12,"I would enjoy having it, yes. Give it to me.
"
,,
4,12,"Go, get it.
"
,,
4,12,"I'm sorry, Lois, I was mistaken.
"
,,
4,12,"I thought you threw the ball in there...
"
,,
4,12,"but I can see now you still have it.
"
,,
4,12,"Go, get the ball.
"
,,
4,12,"I say, are you blind, or just stupid?
"
,,
4,12," What do you mean?
"
,,
4,12," Perhaps you'd like to see...
"
,,
4,12,"what Lois and the fat man have been up to
"
,,
4,12,"in your absence.
"
,,
4,12,"Hello, MTV, I think
"
,,
4,12,"I would be perfect for The ReaI World.
"
,,
4,12,"Because I speak my mind
"
,,
4,12,"and not everyone likes that.
"
,,
4,12,"But I'm not afraid to go there.
"
,,
4,12,"And I can be sexy.
"
,,
4,12,"Look at my fanny, look at my fanny,
"
,,
4,12,"look at my fanny.
"
,,
4,12," Wow, I can't believe they didn't take you.
"
,,
4,12," Shut up!
"
,,
4,12,"all right, here it is.
"
,,
4,12,"Oh Peter.
"
,,
4,12,"Hang on.
"
,,
4,12,"Shazzam!
"
,,
4,12,"Good for you.
"
,,
4,12,"My God. How could they do this to me?
"
,,
4,12,"Peter, I can't keep
"
,,
4,12,"sneaking around with you like this.
"
,,
4,12," See, it's not fair to Brian.
"
,,
4,12," What about me, Lois. I love you, too.
"
,,
4,12,"And the other thing is, Lois, hi, he's a dog.
"
,,
4,12,"Please. Please don't make this any harder
"
,,
4,12,"than it has to be.
"
,,
4,12,"You know, I will always love you,
"
,,
4,12,"but I made a commitment to Brian.
"
,,
4,12,"I can never repay him
"
,,
4,12,"for what he's done for this family.
"
,,
4,12,"I'm sorry, Peter.
"
,,
4,12,"all right, Simon, do your worst.
"
,,
4,12,"I find it's easy
"
,,
4,12,"if I make it into a little song.
"
,,
4,12,"Red, green, blue, green, blue, blue
"
,,
4,12,"Then you put in words
"
,,
4,12,"I like tea and cakes for tea and cake time
"
,,
4,12," Brian, you're still up.
"
,,
4,12," Lois, listen.
"
,,
4,12,"We need to talk.
"
,,
4,12,"Oh, my, I better leave you two alone.
"
,,
4,12," What's the matter, Brian?
"
,,
4,12," I've been thinking about us.
"
,,
4,12,"And I just don't think it's working out.
"
,,
4,12,"Oh, my God. No way.
"
,,
4,12,"You wanna break up. Why?
"
,,
4,12,"I just don't think
"
,,
4,12,"you're the right woman for me.
"
,,
4,12,"Oh, bitch. You got jacked, bitch.
"
,,
4,12,"Maybe you should see
"
,,
4,12,"if Peter will still take you back.
"
,,
4,12," I'm sorry, Lois.
"
,,
4,12," I understand, Brian.
"
,,
4,12,"There's no possible way
"
,,
4,12,"I can ever thank you enough for this.
"
,,
4,12," You're a good friend.
"
,,
4,12," You're a good friend too, Lois.
"
,,
4,12,"That's kind of nice.
"
,,
4,12,"Well, thank God,
"
,,
4,12,"everything's back to normaI.
"
,,
4,12,"I'll say.
"
,,
4,12,"And to think, Brian, I was, like,
"
,,
4,12,"a day away from having sex with you.
"
,,
4,12,"I was gonna push those beds together...
"
,,
4,12,"and take you
"
,,
4,12,"around the freaking world, Brian.
"
,,
4,12,"But a nice pat on the head
"
,,
4,12,"is just as good, huh?
"
,,
4,12," You want your ball?
"
,,
4,12," No, Lois, I don't want the ball right now.
"
,,
4,12,"I'll be in the basement.
"
,,
4,12," Doing what?
"
,,
4,12," What do you think?
"
,,
4,12,"Okay, somebody's gonna have to
"
,,
4,12,"explain that to me.
"
,,
4,13,"It seems today that all you see
"
,,
4,13,"Is violence in movies and sex on TV
"
,,
4,13,"But where are those
"
,,
4,13,"good old-fashioned values
"
,,
4,13,"On which we used to rely?
"
,,
4,13,"Lucky there's a family guy
"
,,
4,13,"Lucky there's a man who
"
,,
4,13,"Positively can do
"
,,
4,13,"all the things that make us
"
,,
4,13,"Laugh and cry
"
,,
4,13,"He's a family guy
"
,,
4,13,"On the next episode
"
,,
4,13,"ofDeadwood.
"
,,
4,13," Anything yet?
"
,,
4,13," No, you?
"
,,
4,13,"Nope.
"
,,
4,13,"Next Deadwood.
"
,,
4,13,"Chris, what're you all dressed up for?
"
,,
4,13,"These are my back-to-schooI clothes.
"
,,
4,13,"I start high schooI tomorrow.
"
,,
4,13,"Oh, boy. You better watch out
"
,,
4,13,"for the Freshman Hunt.
"
,,
4,13,"Yeah. That's where seniors hunt down
"
,,
4,13,"freshmen and nall them with paddles.
"
,,
4,13,"Man, remember how much that was,
"
,,
4,13,"beating those freshmen silly?
"
,,
4,13,"Oh, yeah.
"
,,
4,13,"You're not serious, are you?
"
,,
4,13,"Chris, I'm just as serious as I was
"
,,
4,13,"when I saw PauI Reiser do standup.
"
,,
4,13,"What's the deaI with airline food?
"
,,
4,13,"I mean, is this stuff bad or what?
"
,,
4,13,"Well, that's not nice.
"
,,
4,13,"Those chefs work really hard.
"
,,
4,13,"And what's with those Starbucks, huh?
"
,,
4,13,"They're everywhere.
"
,,
4,13,"Lot of people want coffee.
"
,,
4,13,"It's supply and demand. It's the foundation
"
,,
4,13,"of our entire economy, PauI.
"
,,
4,13,"And who do I talk to about
"
,,
4,13,"those long lines at the ATM?
"
,,
4,13,"That's what I want to know.
"
,,
4,13,"Not me, Mr. Reiser.
"
,,
4,13,"Someone who has time to fritter away,
"
,,
4,13,"but not me.
"
,,
4,13,"Peter, what're you doing?
"
,,
4,13,"You've been out of work forever.
"
,,
4,13,"You promised me you were going out
"
,,
4,13,"to look for a job today.
"
,,
4,13,"Oh, okay. I'll go look for a job, Lois.
"
,,
4,13,"What is this? The latest Redbook.
"
,,
4,13,"Is she gone?
"
,,
4,13,"Them and their squabbling.
"
,,
4,13,"Although I suppose they're not
"
,,
4,13,"the first couple to have problems.
"
,,
4,13," Did you have a nice day?
"
,,
4,13," It was okay.
"
,,
4,13,"You know,
"
,,
4,13,"our son got into your closet today.
"
,,
4,13,"Okay.
"
,,
4,13,"Anything... Anything in there, maybe you
"
,,
4,13,"wouldn't have wanted him to see?
"
,,
4,13,"No.
"
,,
4,13,"Really? You don't have any
"
,,
4,13,"dirty pictures in there?
"
,,
4,13,"No.
"
,,
4,13,"Then how do you explain these?
"
,,
4,13," So what? So, I have some paintings.
"
,,
4,13," Is this how you want me to look?
"
,,
4,13,"Come on, Karen.
"
,,
4,13,"Do you hate your body so much...
"
,,
4,13,"you have to reduce every painting of
"
,,
4,13,"the female form to pornography?
"
,,
4,13,"Don't you do that.
"
,,
4,13,"Don't make this my fault.
"
,,
4,13,"It is your fault.
"
,,
4,13,"I just want to come home and have dinner.
"
,,
4,13,"And have my wife say, ""Hello, how was
"
,,
4,13,"your day?"" That's impossible for you.
"
,,
4,13," You know what this is about?
"
,,
4,13," What?
"
,,
4,13,"This is about your disrespect for me,
"
,,
4,13,"this family and everything we stand for.
"
,,
4,13,"What do we stand for?
"
,,
4,13,"Who are we, the Goracks now?
"
,,
4,13,"Suddenly you're Cynthia Gorack.
"
,,
4,13,"That's what you want, isn't it?
"
,,
4,13,"You want to be Cynthia Gorack.
"
,,
4,13,"You know what, at least Cynthia Gorack's
"
,,
4,13,"husband cares about her family.
"
,,
4,13,"I can't even talk to you
"
,,
4,13,"when you're like this.
"
,,
4,13,"Okay. It's over now because you say it is.
"
,,
4,13,"Way to go, Karen.
"
,,
4,13,"You solve all our problems
"
,,
4,13,"by just walking away!
"
,,
4,13,"And it's so obvious
"
,,
4,13,"I don't care about the family.
"
,,
4,13,"I just killed a 700-pound tiger
"
,,
4,13,"with a stick and a rock!
"
,,
4,13,"That doesn't make you a man, Gary.
"
,,
4,13,"Here we go.
"
,,
4,13,"Here's act two of the performance.
"
,,
4,13,"Karen pretends to leave home
"
,,
4,13,"for the 20th time.
"
,,
4,13,"You know what, Karen. Go!
"
,,
4,13,"I'm not going to stop you. Just go!
"
,,
4,13," Get out! Get the hell out!
"
,,
4,13," Screw you, Gary!
"
,,
4,13,"Yeah, if you did that more often,
"
,,
4,13,"maybe I wouldn't need these paintings!
"
,,
4,13,"What the hell you looking at?
"
,,
4,13,"I say, anybody listen
"
,,
4,13,"to Howard Stern this morning?
"
,,
4,13,"He had some strippers in the studio.
"
,,
4,13,"They sounded hot.
"
,,
4,13,"Then he made a joke about a negro.
"
,,
4,13,"But Robin laughed, so it was okay.
"
,,
4,13,"I think I'm coming down with something.
"
,,
4,13,"Chris, relax.
"
,,
4,13,"The Freshman Hunt doesn't really exist.
"
,,
4,13,"It's just a myth to scare freshmen.
"
,,
4,13,"Really? Oh boy, that's a relief.
"
,,
4,13,"Now have a good day at schooI, sweetie.
"
,,
4,13,"Freshman!
"
,,
4,13,"Help me!
"
,,
4,13,"Freshman.
"
,,
4,13,"I got you, you freshman.
"
,,
4,13,"I'm going to teach you the lesson
"
,,
4,13,"that it is not okay to be a freshman.
"
,,
4,13,"all right, Mr. Griffin.
"
,,
4,13,"Jobs you think you would be suited for.
"
,,
4,13,"Let's see what you wrote.
"
,,
4,13,"""Cowboy, astronaut...
"
,,
4,13,"""warlock, more powerfuI astronaut,
"
,,
4,13,"beer expert. ""
"
,,
4,13,"Yeah. And I need something
"
,,
4,13,"that pays more than my last job as...
"
,,
4,13,"Sandy Duncan's glass eye.
"
,,
4,13,"Hey Sandy. Sandy?
"
,,
4,13,"What?
"
,,
4,13," What're you buying?
"
,,
4,13," Some breakfast cereaI.
"
,,
4,13,"No, don't get that. That's a bad cereaI.
"
,,
4,13,"Get some of the Boo Berry.
"
,,
4,13,"Turns out there's a job opening
"
,,
4,13,"at the Pawtucket Brewery.
"
,,
4,13,"Wow, that sounds even better than
"
,,
4,13,"when I got paid to take part in that study.
"
,,
4,13,"The only one who couldn't finish
"
,,
4,13,"the puzzle is the fat one.
"
,,
4,13,"I'm sorry. I can't see what you're
"
,,
4,13,"going for here. Let me look at...
"
,,
4,13,"Oh, it's a jar of preserves. Oh.
"
,,
4,13,"Yeah, I guess
"
,,
4,13,"that's what all the red pieces were.
"
,,
4,13,"Hey, Chris, was schooI any better today?
"
,,
4,13,"No, I hate it. I never want to go back!
"
,,
4,13,"Oh, come on, it'll get better.
"
,,
4,13,"You just have to find your place.
"
,,
4,13,"Let's go, Stewie.
"
,,
4,13,"Time to change your diaper.
"
,,
4,13,"I'm not worried about high schooI at all.
"
,,
4,13,"Worst-case scenario...
"
,,
4,13,"I'll carve out a niche as the effeminate
"
,,
4,13,"male friend of the popular girls.
"
,,
4,13,"Okay, tonight's my OC party.
"
,,
4,13,"I got a case of wine coolers,
"
,,
4,13,"so we can drink every time Ryan seethes.
"
,,
4,13," CooI, I'd love to come.
"
,,
4,13," Me too.
"
,,
4,13,"How'd you get the wine coolers?
"
,,
4,13,"Oh, it's... I just did some stuff
"
,,
4,13,"for a guy in the parking lot.
"
,,
4,13,"Does anyone have any Scope?
"
,,
4,13,"I don't care what she says.
"
,,
4,13,"I'm never going back!
"
,,
4,13,"Look, you can't run away
"
,,
4,13,"from your problems, Chris.
"
,,
4,13,"That's what I tried to do.
"
,,
4,13,"I joined the Peace Corps and a day later,
"
,,
4,13,"I was two continents away.
"
,,
4,13," Really?
"
,,
4,13," Yup.
"
,,
4,13,"But 6,000 miles
"
,,
4,13,"and all the dope I could smoke...
"
,,
4,13,"still couldn't separate me
"
,,
4,13,"from my problems.
"
,,
4,13,"And this was good dope.
"
,,
4,13,"I mean, it was growing everywhere.
"
,,
4,13,"Oh, my God.
"
,,
4,13,"This one time, we got so baked...
"
,,
4,13,"we ended up eating all the food
"
,,
4,13,"the World Health Organization...
"
,,
4,13,"had airlifted in.
"
,,
4,13,"Man, those villagers were so pissed.
"
,,
4,13,"They tried to chase us, but let me just say,
"
,,
4,13,"thank God for polio.
"
,,
4,13,"Anyway, my point is that...
"
,,
4,13,"Is Peter here? I want to re-hire him.
"
,,
4,13,"My new eye isn't working out.
"
,,
4,13,"Hey, Wheat Thins! Take your top off.
"
,,
4,13,"I like pancakes, I like pancakes
"
,,
4,13,"They make me a happy Peter
"
,,
4,13,"I am happy, I am happy,
"
,,
4,13,"la la la la la.
"
,,
4,13,"Peter, you seem happy this morning.
"
,,
4,13,"You bet.
"
,,
4,13,"I'm starting my new job at the brewery.
"
,,
4,13,"Finally, I'm one of those guys who can't
"
,,
4,13,"wait to get to work in the morning.
"
,,
4,13,"Like a dairy cow.
"
,,
4,13,"Oh, yes!
"
,,
4,13,"Yes!
"
,,
4,13,"Peter, I just found this note
"
,,
4,13,"in Chris' room.
"
,,
4,13," He ran away to join the Peace Corps.
"
,,
4,13," Oh, my God! Give me that!
"
,,
4,13,"No, that.
"
,,
4,13,"I'm bored with it now!
"
,,
4,13,"Peter, Chris ran off to South America.
"
,,
4,13,"Well, where the hell
"
,,
4,13,"would he get an idea like that?
"
,,
4,13,"Wait a second. Don't we know someone
"
,,
4,13,"who was in the Peace Corps?
"
,,
4,13,"Yeah, who was that?
"
,,
4,13,"Was that Beau Bridges?
"
,,
4,13," Do we know Beau Bridges?
"
,,
4,13," No, we don't.
"
,,
4,13,"I am positive we know somebody
"
,,
4,13,"who was in the Peace Corps.
"
,,
4,13,"Look, it's me, all right.
"
,,
4,13,"He got the idea from me.
"
,,
4,13,"Brian, what the hell is wrong with you?
"
,,
4,13,"I didn't do it on purpose.
"
,,
4,13,"And before you fly off the handle,
"
,,
4,13,"you may want to think about it.
"
,,
4,13,"The kid's obviously confused.
"
,,
4,13,"This might be good for him.
"
,,
4,13,"People do crazy things
"
,,
4,13,"when they're confused.
"
,,
4,13,"Like the time my agent
"
,,
4,13,"dropped that bomb on me.
"
,,
4,13," No one in this town will hire you.
"
,,
4,13," Oh, yeah?
"
,,
4,13,"Taxi. Taxi. Taxi!
"
,,
4,13,"all right, Chris.
"
,,
4,13,"We're approaching your assigned village.
"
,,
4,13,"Tell the people to work together
"
,,
4,13,"and drink clean water.
"
,,
4,13,"And by the way, the word ""colored"" still
"
,,
4,13,"flies down there. So, get your fill.
"
,,
4,13,"Hello, I am Chief Oleki.
"
,,
4,13,"Welcome to my village.
"
,,
4,13,"Our air is clean. Our food is bountifuI
"
,,
4,13,"and our water is caffeine-free.
"
,,
4,13,"Never had it. Never will.
"
,,
4,13,"This is my daughter, Loka.
"
,,
4,13,"My son, Hidalgo. And my cousin, Vinny.
"
,,
4,13,"Hey, how you doing?
"
,,
4,13,"Give me a word, any word at all...
"
,,
4,13,"and I'll pronounce it funny for a nickeI.
"
,,
4,13," Hello?
"
,,
4,13," Hi, Mom.
"
,,
4,13," Chris, are you all right?
"
,,
4,13," Chris, buddy, thank God you're okay!
"
,,
4,13," Hi, Dad.
"
,,
4,13," Hey, this has been driving me crazy.
"
,,
4,13," Who was the chick on Remington Steele?
"
,,
4,13," Hello?
"
,,
4,13," Stephanie Zimballst?
"
,,
4,13," No, Stewie Griffin. Who's this?
"
,,
4,13," Thank you.
"
,,
4,13," Chris, what are you doing down there?
"
,,
4,13,"Relax, Mom. I'm having a great time.
"
,,
4,13," You people knocked me off the modem.
"
,,
4,13," When are you coming home?
"
,,
4,13,"How's the food in South America?
"
,,
4,13,"Do the women there
"
,,
4,13,"have exposed clitterati?
"
,,
4,13,"I'll be home in a month, after people
"
,,
4,13,"have forgotten I'm a freshman.
"
,,
4,13,"Well... Please, just take care
"
,,
4,13,"of yourself, honey.
"
,,
4,13,"Hey guys. Is everyone on the phone?
"
,,
4,13," I got to go.
"
,,
4,13," Something's in the oven.
"
,,
4,13," I lost a shoe.
"
,,
4,13," Don't leave me on phone with her!
"
,,
4,13," Stewie?
"
,,
4,13," Hey...
"
,,
4,13," How's school?
"
,,
4,13," Hi, Stewie...
"
,,
4,13,"Listen, I am swamped...
"
,,
4,13,"but Mom has kept me up to date
"
,,
4,13,"on everything you're doing...
"
,,
4,13,"and I think it's just great.
"
,,
4,13,"Hanging up now.
"
,,
4,13,"Boy, this place sure has changed
"
,,
4,13,"since Pawtucket Pat sold it.
"
,,
4,13,"So, this is where you'll be working,
"
,,
4,13,"Mr. Griffin.
"
,,
4,13,"Oh, and I should mention, employees
"
,,
4,13,"are welcome to free Pawtucket Ale.
"
,,
4,13,"We just ask that you don't drink
"
,,
4,13,"during your shift.
"
,,
4,13," That won't be a problem, sir.
"
,,
4,13," Great.
"
,,
4,13,"I'll be right back with your ID badge.
"
,,
4,13,"Mr. Griffin, what happened to your pants?
"
,,
4,13,"Oh, look, who's here.
"
,,
4,13,"Mr. ""I don't have time
"
,,
4,13,"for your Little League games. ""
"
,,
4,13,"Come here, you son of a bitch!
"
,,
4,13,"Why do you close your eyes
"
,,
4,13,"when we make love?!
"
,,
4,13,"I wonder how your father's first day
"
,,
4,13,"at work went?
"
,,
4,13," Dad, what the hell are you doing?
"
,,
4,13," Yeah, hey, buddy.
"
,,
4,13,"I'll have a triple cheeseburger
"
,,
4,13,"and a large fries and...
"
,,
4,13,"Do you sell pants?
"
,,
4,13,"Hey, Meg, what's with all the beer cans?
"
,,
4,13,"My dad got a job at the brewery
"
,,
4,13,"and he gets lots of free beer.
"
,,
4,13,"Actually, he's kind
"
,,
4,13,"of been going overboard lately.
"
,,
4,13," Oh, my God!
"
,,
4,13," Hey, Meg, you seen my pants?
"
,,
4,13,"Lois, by the way, we're out of toilet paper.
"
,,
4,13,"Chris, thank you for helping bring water
"
,,
4,13,"to my village.
"
,,
4,13," You're a hero.
"
,,
4,13," No. Lou Gehrig was a hero.
"
,,
4,13,"Excellent. As soon as I release
"
,,
4,13,"this biologicaI toxin...
"
,,
4,13,"into the world's water supply,
"
,,
4,13,"I will rule the world.
"
,,
4,13,"I'll call it ""Lou Gehrig's Disease. ""
"
,,
4,13,"I just have to remember to make sure
"
,,
4,13,"this cap is screwed on tight.
"
,,
4,13,"Well, I guess the joke's on me.
"
,,
4,13,"This is a gift from all of us.
"
,,
4,13,"Go ahead, try it on.
"
,,
4,13,"Okay.
"
,,
4,13,"Oh my, Chris, we can see your genitals.
"
,,
4,13,"Just kidding.
"
,,
4,13,"Everyone's genitals are hanging out.
"
,,
4,13,"Really?
"
,,
4,13,"Ha, ha, ha!
"
,,
4,13,"Wow! This is just like Bible camp!
"
,,
4,13,"Only I'm not crying and trying
"
,,
4,13,"to pretend I'm somewhere else.
"
,,
4,13,"Mr. Griffin,
"
,,
4,13,"since you can't controI your drinking...
"
,,
4,13,"you've been demoted to
"
,,
4,13,"the shipping department.
"
,,
4,13," Oh, come on!
"
,,
4,13," This is your new supervisor, Angela.
"
,,
4,13,"Mr. Griffin, we have different rules here.
"
,,
4,13,"For starters, no drinking. Period.
"
,,
4,13,"We start work at 7:00 a. m. sharp.
"
,,
4,13,"This is your co-worker, Opie.
"
,,
4,13,"He is a burden of the state,
"
,,
4,13,"deemed unfit for mainstream society.
"
,,
4,13,"He is your superior.
"
,,
4,13,"What'd he say?
"
,,
4,13,"He said he wants you
"
,,
4,13,"to put your finger in his mouth.
"
,,
4,13,"If you value your job, I'd do it.
"
,,
4,13,"Ow! He bit me!
"
,,
4,13,"Mr. Griffin, although I may not fully
"
,,
4,13,"understand Opie's management style...
"
,,
4,13,"he has proven himself
"
,,
4,13,"a more competent employee than you.
"
,,
4,13,"So, in my absence, you will listen to him.
"
,,
4,13,"Come on, guy.
"
,,
4,13,"Damn it! This is worse than being
"
,,
4,13,"Kevin Federline's magic mirror!
"
,,
4,13,"Magic mirror,
"
,,
4,13,"how can I look like a douchebag today?
"
,,
4,13,"Well, Kevin, I would say, first of all,
"
,,
4,13,"don't shave or shower.
"
,,
4,13,"Okay, I won't.
"
,,
4,13," And you just got out of bed, right?
"
,,
4,13," Yeah.
"
,,
4,13,"I would say, just go ahead
"
,,
4,13,"and wear that tank top all day.
"
,,
4,13,"Okay.
"
,,
4,13,"all right, so we covered the hygiene,
"
,,
4,13,"no collared shirts.
"
,,
4,13,"Oh, and don't forget to walk around with
"
,,
4,13,"an undeserved sense of accomplishment.
"
,,
4,13,"Chris, the festivaI of the harvest is
"
,,
4,13,"the time of celebration for my people.
"
,,
4,13," Would you like to dance?
"
,,
4,13," Sure!
"
,,
4,13,"No one's ever asked me to dance before.
"
,,
4,13,"I wanna jitterbug
"
,,
4,13,"Jitterbug
"
,,
4,13,"You put the boom-boom into my heart
"
,,
4,13,"You send my souI sky high
"
,,
4,13,"when your lovin' starts
"
,,
4,13,"Jitterbug into my brain
"
,,
4,13,"Goes a bang-bang-bang
"
,,
4,13,"till my feet do the same
"
,,
4,13,"Wake me up before you go-go
"
,,
4,13,"Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo
"
,,
4,13,"Wake me up before you go-go
"
,,
4,13,"And take me dancing tonight
"
,,
4,13,"Do, do do do do.
"
,,
4,13,"This is a joyous occasion.
"
,,
4,13,"You've engaged the entire tribe in dance.
"
,,
4,13,"According to our customs,
"
,,
4,13,"you're now married to my daughter.
"
,,
4,13,"I couldn't be happier.
"
,,
4,13,"Well, if you're happy then I'm happy,
"
,,
4,13,"because after all... What?
"
,,
4,13,"My job sucks.
"
,,
4,13,"I'm tired of always scrounging around
"
,,
4,13,"on the bottom rung of society...
"
,,
4,13,"getting kicked around by the Man.
"
,,
4,13,"Like when I worked in that lab
"
,,
4,13,"with Dr. Bunsen Honeydew.
"
,,
4,13,"Agreed, Peter.
"
,,
4,13,"Ohh! We got a letter from Chris!
"
,,
4,13,"Okay, he says he's doing great,
"
,,
4,13,"having a wonderfuI time...
"
,,
4,13,"He met a girl! Aha! He got married...?
"
,,
4,13,"He says he's not coming back!
"
,,
4,13,"We'll be landing in South America shortly.
"
,,
4,13,"Please buckle your seat belts.
"
,,
4,13,"Hey, Brenda,
"
,,
4,13,"what've you got for me? Coffee?
"
,,
4,13,"Damn, your ass looks hot. Is this thing on?
"
,,
4,13,"I don't care. I want them to hear.
"
,,
4,13,"Oh, Chris, my baby.
"
,,
4,13,"I told you, Peter. I never should
"
,,
4,13,"have let him out of my stomach.
"
,,
4,13,"I can't believe Chris got married.
"
,,
4,13,"This is bigger news than
"
,,
4,13,"when I toured Europe...
"
,,
4,13,"with that musicaI rendition
"
,,
4,13,"of My Left Foot.
"
,,
4,13,"My left foot
"
,,
4,13,"Always been better than
"
,,
4,13,"the right one
"
,,
4,13,"My left foot
"
,,
4,13,"Always gets me where I need to go
"
,,
4,13,"I'll start out easy.
"
,,
4,13,"Little more complex.
"
,,
4,13," Oh, Chris, my baby!
"
,,
4,13," Hi, Mom and Dad.
"
,,
4,13,"Everybody, this is my wife, Loka.
"
,,
4,13,"We're married.
"
,,
4,13,"Well, maybe here, but not in America,
"
,,
4,13,"where God pays attention.
"
,,
4,13,"Now, get your things together.
"
,,
4,13,"We're leaving right now.
"
,,
4,13,"Mom, I'm not going anywhere.
"
,,
4,13,"I'm happy here.
"
,,
4,13,"This is my home.
"
,,
4,13,"You guys got an ATM?
"
,,
4,13,"I only got $37 on me.
"
,,
4,13,"What's the matter with them?
"
,,
4,13,"We've never seen
"
,,
4,13,"that much money before.
"
,,
4,13," You are richest man in the country.
"
,,
4,13," Richest man in the country?
"
,,
4,13,"Wow, no Griffin's been this powerfuI
"
,,
4,13,"since my ancestor King Arthur Griffin.
"
,,
4,13,"Arthur, if you are able to draw
"
,,
4,13,"the sword from the stone...
"
,,
4,13,"and prove to me you truly are
"
,,
4,13,"the sole king of Camelot...
"
,,
4,13,"I will make love to you right here
"
,,
4,13,"in the clearing.
"
,,
4,13,"What if I can just move it an inch,
"
,,
4,13,"will you touch me?
"
,,
4,13,"This is amazing. You've got the biggest
"
,,
4,13,"hut in the village and all these servants...
"
,,
4,13,"and you've only spent $1.50.
"
,,
4,13,"That's a hell of a lot less than I had
"
,,
4,13,"to spend...
"
,,
4,13,"to go see that piece-of-crap remake
"
,,
4,13,"of Bewitched.
"
,,
4,13," Guess what? I'm a witch.
"
,,
4,13," Guess what? I'm a Clippers fan.
"
,,
4,13,"all ticketed passengers
"
,,
4,13,"for Flight 2378 to Reno, Nevada...
"
,,
4,13," Hello.
"
,,
4,13," That's not funny!
"
,,
4,13,"Peter, this is ridiculous.
"
,,
4,13,"We came here to take Chris home.
"
,,
4,13,"Why are we staying?
"
,,
4,13,"Because I'm tired of being treated like crap
"
,,
4,13,"at work.
"
,,
4,13,"Don't you see what this means to me?
"
,,
4,13,"I'm somebody here.
"
,,
4,13,"Finally, a white man has an opportunity
"
,,
4,13,"to be rich and in charge.
"
,,
4,13,"Hey, Pesci, here's a nickeI. Say Yugoslavia.
"
,,
4,13,"Yugoslavia.
"
,,
4,13,"Ha, ha, ha! Here's a dime, kill Pesci.
"
,,
4,13,"The native man
"
,,
4,13,"is an impressive physicaI specimen.
"
,,
4,13,"Look closely at his sinewy muscular form
"
,,
4,13,"and unusuaI vitallty.
"
,,
4,13,"It is a thrill to watch him dig a ditch or
"
,,
4,13,"lift a jug of water or participate in a hunt.
"
,,
4,13,"Cut. Print. Gay.
"
,,
4,13,"What's going on?
"
,,
4,13,"Peter paid the villagers to reenact
"
,,
4,13,"the ""Contest"" episode of Seinfeld.
"
,,
4,13," I am out.
"
,,
4,13," Huh?
"
,,
4,13,"I am out. I have pleasured myself.
"
,,
4,13,"Dad, I've had enough of you
"
,,
4,13,"taking advantage of these people.
"
,,
4,13,"For God's sake, the woman playing Elaine
"
,,
4,13,"is a high priestess.
"
,,
4,13,"You can't spare one square?
"
,,
4,13,"I don't have to take that from you.
"
,,
4,13,"I'm the richest guy in town.
"
,,
4,13,"Dad, don't you see?
"
,,
4,13,"This is a wonderfuI place...
"
,,
4,13,"and you're just using it to escape
"
,,
4,13,"from your problems at home.
"
,,
4,13,"What do you mean? Meg's right there.
"
,,
4,13,"But Chris, honey,
"
,,
4,13,"aren't you doing the same thing?
"
,,
4,13,"What do you mean?
"
,,
4,13,"I mean, you just came here because
"
,,
4,13,"you were being picked on at schooI.
"
,,
4,13,"You're using these people
"
,,
4,13,"to escape your problems.
"
,,
4,13,"Oh, my God. You're right.
"
,,
4,13,"I married this 11-year-old girI
"
,,
4,13,"for all the wrong reasons.
"
,,
4,13,"I'm sorry, Loka.
"
,,
4,13,"I guess I just came here because
"
,,
4,13,"I was afraid of being a freshman.
"
,,
4,13,"Freshman?
"
,,
4,13,"Freshman!
"
,,
4,13,"I guess you can't run away
"
,,
4,13,"from your problems anywhere.
"
,,
4,13,"Jock! Start the engine! Get the plane up!
"
,,
4,13,"Peter, I think we forgot Meg.
"
,,
4,14,"This is a message to all American infidels.
"
,,
4,14,"Prepare to die in a sea of holy fire.
"
,,
4,14,"You will be punished for your decadent ways
"
,,
4,14,"on the first day of Radaman. You...
"
,,
4,14,"Wait. Did I just say R...?
"
,,
4,14,"What'd I say? ""Radaman""?
"
,,
4,14,"Ramadan. Radaman?
"
,,
4,14,"What is that? What is...?
"
,,
4,14,"Maybe Dennis Radaman is going
"
,,
4,14,"to punish you with his crazy hair. No?
"
,,
4,14,"What's that? Right, yeah.
"
,,
4,14,"OK. Let's go again.
"
,,
4,14,"This is a message to all Amer...
"
,,
4,14,"I'm not gonna be able to do it now.
"
,,
4,14,"I'm not... OK, OK. I know.
"
,,
4,14,"I gotta get...
"
,,
4,14,"I gotta get all the laughs out. OK.
"
,,
4,14,"Gotta get all the laughs out.
"
,,
4,14," OK.
"
,,
4,14," Today sometime.
"
,,
4,14,"Stop making that face. What are you doing?
"
,,
4,14,"He makes that face and it makes me laugh.
"
,,
4,14,"You know what? Just turn around. I don't
"
,,
4,14,"care where you look. Just look over there.
"
,,
4,14,"They're cracking up over there. OK.
"
,,
4,14,"Now look who's snickering over there.
"
,,
4,14,"Mr ""I Can't Do A Suicide Bombing
"
,,
4,14,"Because I'm Sick"".
"
,,
4,14,"He had a note... He had a note from his
"
,,
4,14,"doctor. He brought a note from his doctor.
"
,,
4,14,"It's a suicide bombing. What are you...?
"
,,
4,14,"OK. All right. OK. Here we go.
"
,,
4,14,"Here we go. All serious now. OK.
"
,,
4,14,"Death to...
"
,,
4,14,"I can't... I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't...
"
,,
4,14,"Come on. Now you're just trying
"
,,
4,14,"to make... Hey, wait, wait, wait.
"
,,
4,14,"Look. Look. Rubber chicken, you know?
"
,,
4,14,"I should do the whole tape
"
,,
4,14,"with this in my hand.
"
,,
4,14,"Just with the chicken right here.
"
,,
4,14,"Everyone will be, like, ""What the hell?""
"
,,
4,14,"Death to Americans.
"
,,
4,14,"Let him do it. Let him do the tape.
"
,,
4,14,"Don't blame me. It was the chicken. He was...
"
,,
4,14,"No. Actually,
"
,,
4,14,"you know what would be better? Wait.
"
,,
4,14,"Just walk out like this.
"
,,
4,14,"Just come out like this, but all serious.
"
,,
4,14,"Completely serious,
"
,,
4,14,"like I don't even know I'm wearing them.
"
,,
4,14,"Death to America.
"
,,
4,14,"What? What are you looking at?
"
,,
4,14,"Do I have something on my face?
"
,,
4,14,"What? Right here?
"
,,
4,14,"I'm just wearing my regular glasses.
"
,,
4,14,"I always wear these. What?
"
,,
4,14,"It's me in an '80s movie, right?
"
,,
4,14,"Yeah, he got it.
"
,,
4,14,"He got it over there. The little guy got it.
"
,,
4,14,"Who is that guy? I've never seen him before.
"
,,
4,14,"How's it going, chief?
"
,,
4,14,"Good day to you, sir.
"
,,
4,14,"And now prepare to die.
"
,,
4,14,"Who are you?
"
,,
4,14,"I'm Stewie Griffin.
"
,,
4,14,"And don't ever let me
"
,,
4,14,"catch you guys in Quahog.
"
,,
4,14,"Hey, Stewie. Who the hell is that?
"
,,
4,14,"Peter, it's 5:30 in the morning.
"
,,
4,14," Sorry. I didn't know you were home.
"
,,
4,14," What the hell are you doing?
"
,,
4,14,"Laying down the red carpet.
"
,,
4,14,"The Emmys are on.
"
,,
4,14,"Don't tell me you forgot
"
,,
4,14,"about Meg's play tonight.
"
,,
4,14,"Meg sucks. Everything she does
"
,,
4,14,"is so freaking terrible and depressing.
"
,,
4,14,"I went to her first-grade play that time.
"
,,
4,14,"Robin Hood, the king is keeping me
"
,,
4,14,"prisoner here in his castle.
"
,,
4,14,"Don't worry, Maid Marian. I'll save you.
"
,,
4,14,"Boy, you guys
"
,,
4,14,"are not sucking me into the story at all.
"
,,
4,14,"I'm just telling for your own benefit. I'm very
"
,,
4,14,"aware that I'm watching a play right now.
"
,,
4,14," I gotta watch the Emmys.
"
,,
4,14," You're going to Meg's play and that's that.
"
,,
4,14,"Is that that, now, Mrs That's That?
"
,,
4,14,"If you're gonna shoot me
"
,,
4,14,"you might want to tie your shoelaces first.
"
,,
4,14," Are you gonna go to Meg's play or not?
"
,,
4,14," Yes.
"
,,
4,14," You like eating red carpet, tough guy?
"
,,
4,14," Yes.
"
,,
4,14," Say you like eating red carpet.
"
,,
4,14," I like eating red carpet.
"
,,
4,14,"Giggety.
"
,,
4,14,"God, why do you wear
"
,,
4,14,"those rainbow suspenders?
"
,,
4,14,"Well, I could tell you, but I'd rather show you
"
,,
4,14,"through interpretive dance.
"
,,
4,14,"Crying baby. I'll take him out.
"
,,
4,14,"You know, Lois, if we leave now, we can
"
,,
4,14,"catch the Emmy for best documentary.
"
,,
4,14," I hear there's one on vacuuming.
"
,,
4,14," Really? That sounds interesting...
"
,,
4,14,"Wait a minute. You can't fool me that easily.
"
,,
4,14,"You are not watching the Emmys.
"
,,
4,14,"Now, shush.
"
,,
4,14,"Excuse me. I gotta do some black-guy stuff.
"
,,
4,14,"Man, this sucks
"
,,
4,14,"worse than my 16th birthday party.
"
,,
4,14,"Thanks for coming
"
,,
4,14,"to my birthday party, Jake Ryan.
"
,,
4,14,"Thanks for having me
"
,,
4,14,"to your birthday party, Peter. Make a wish.
"
,,
4,14,"It's already come true.
"
,,
4,14,"Here's your present.
"
,,
4,14,"No! Jake, not like this.
"
,,
4,14,"Our top story, beloved entertainer Bob Hope
"
,,
4,14,"briefly came back to life,
"
,,
4,14,"only to die in a tragic motorcycle accident.
"
,,
4,14,"Hey, I'm gonnajump all those trash cans.
"
,,
4,14,"In other news, actor David Hyde Pierce
"
,,
4,14,"created a major controversy at the Emmys,
"
,,
4,14,"when a ""trouser malfunction""
"
,,
4,14,"caused him to expose his testicles.
"
,,
4,14,"Glad I didn't miss the Emmys.
"
,,
4,14,"That's great. Thanks to you,
"
,,
4,14,"I missed a moment of television history.
"
,,
4,14,"Well, now you know how George W Bush felt
"
,,
4,14,"when he showed up in Vietnam.
"
,,
4,14,"All right, let's do this. Let's kick some ass.
"
,,
4,14," George, the war's over.
"
,,
4,14," What?
"
,,
4,14,"Yeah, it's done.
"
,,
4,14," Are you serious?
"
,,
4,14," Yeah.
"
,,
4,14,"Oh, man. Oh, man, I just got
"
,,
4,14,"your messages and... I'm sorry.
"
,,
4,14," It's been over for a while.
"
,,
4,14," Really?
"
,,
4,14,"Yeah, it's 1981.
"
,,
4,14," It's... Wow, so I'm way late. Oh, boy.
"
,,
4,14," Yeah.
"
,,
4,14," You wanna do something else?
"
,,
4,14," I got some blow.
"
,,
4,14,"Son of a bitch!
"
,,
4,14,"Took you this long to tell me. Break it out.
"
,,
4,14,"We got 20 calls
"
,,
4,14,"about the David Hyde Pierce incident.
"
,,
4,14,"As you know,
"
,,
4,14,"one call equals a billion people,
"
,,
4,14,"which means 20 billion people
"
,,
4,14,"were offended by this.
"
,,
4,14,"Something must be done.
"
,,
4,14," Perhaps we should ask the chairman.
"
,,
4,14," Good idea.
"
,,
4,14,"Sir, what course of action do you recommend
"
,,
4,14,"regarding the Hyde Pierce incident?
"
,,
4,14,"You've got to censor television, you fools.
"
,,
4,14,"Now, follow my orders.
"
,,
4,14,"Jack, are you out there?
"
,,
4,14,"I want to show you my new bikini.
"
,,
4,14,"What? Why are they
"
,,
4,14,"blocking out all the good stuff?
"
,,
4,14,"starring... van...</i>
"
,,
4,14,"They're messing with my shows.
"
,,
4,14,"about that Honeymooners episode.</i>
"
,,
4,14,"One of these days, Alice, one of these days...
"
,,
4,14,"I'll stimulate the economy
"
,,
4,14,"by buying an American car.
"
,,
4,14,"The FCC must be overreacting
"
,,
4,14,"to the David Hyde Pierce incident.
"
,,
4,14," They're censoring anything unpleasant.
"
,,
4,14," What the hell?
"
,,
4,14,"They let Sarah Jessica Parker's face on TV
"
,,
4,14,"and she looks like a foot.
"
,,
4,14,"Well, mark my words, I'm gonna fight this.
"
,,
4,14,"You're on TV.
"
,,
4,14,"Can't you do something about this?
"
,,
4,14,"Well, Peter, I'm flattered you came to me
"
,,
4,14,"for help. We'll have more after this.
"
,,
4,14,"We're back. To answer your question,
"
,,
4,14,"if you want to control content,
"
,,
4,14,"start your own TV station.
"
,,
4,14,"My own TV station. I haven't had my own
"
,,
4,14,"business since that mail-order operation.
"
,,
4,14,"I bought a giant, life-size slingshot from you.
"
,,
4,14,"Itjust slammed me into a mountain.
"
,,
4,14," No returns.
"
,,
4,14," I've been a customer for years.
"
,,
4,14," I can maybe give you a store credit.
"
,,
4,14," But... Really? Well, I guess...
"
,,
4,14," What's the hold-up?
"
,,
4,14," I'm taking care of it.
"
,,
4,14,"What are you doing? What is all this stuff?
"
,,
4,14,"Dad's starting his own TV station,
"
,,
4,14,"but I'm not supposed to tell Mom
"
,,
4,14,"because she'll just bitch him out.
"
,,
4,14,"What do you expect to accomplish?
"
,,
4,14,"I'm saving television.
"
,,
4,14,"Apache Chief, put the satellite on the roof.
"
,,
4,14,"Sure, Peter. Apache Chief, eeh-nay-chuk.
"
,,
4,14,"Well, that was the high point of my day.
"
,,
4,14,"Guess I'll go gamble.
"
,,
4,14,"Hi there. I'm Peter Griffin,
"
,,
4,14,"and you're watching PTV,
"
,,
4,14,"with your favourite shows
"
,,
4,14,"as nature intended them -
"
,,
4,14,"with all the sex, violence,
"
,,
4,14,"swearing and farts intact,
"
,,
4,14,"where Archie got the Jeffersons to move.</i>
"
,,
4,14,"Time for you to move there, Jefferson.
"
,,
4,14,"Oh, Archie.
"
,,
4,14,"I can't see out of my sheet.
"
,,
4,14,"Edith, will you stifle yourself?
"
,,
4,14,"We're supposed to be incognitus.
"
,,
4,14,"that classic episode of The Waltons?</i>
"
,,
4,14," Good night, Jim Bob.
"
,,
4,14," Good night, Pa.
"
,,
4,14," Good night. Good night, Elizabeth.
"
,,
4,14," Good night. Good night, Ma.
"
,,
4,14,"Good night, Elizabeth.
"
,,
4,14,"Good night, John Boy.
"
,,
4,14,"Good night, John Boy.
"
,,
4,14," John Boy?
"
,,
4,14," Can't a guy masturbate?
"
,,
4,14,"Peter, look at these numbers. We're a hit.
"
,,
4,14,"I'd think about expanding your programming.
"
,,
4,14,"Brian, that's a great idea. That's exactly
"
,,
4,14,"what we need to take PTV to the next level.
"
,,
4,14,"Original programming.
"
,,
4,14,"to The Peter Griffin Side Boob Hour,</i>
"
,,
4,14,"a wonderful look back on all the partial nudity
"
,,
4,14,"network television used to offer.
"
,,
4,14,"Look at that side boob.
"
,,
4,14,"Check out this side boob.
"
,,
4,14,"How about that side boob? That turn you on?
"
,,
4,14,"Well, it shouldn't, cos that's my side boob.
"
,,
4,14,"Good night, everybody.
"
,,
4,14,"So, what do you think?
"
,,
4,14,"You gotta be careful
"
,,
4,14,"about what you put on your network.
"
,,
4,14,"Children are impressionable.
"
,,
4,14,"Remember when Chris saw Jackie Mason?
"
,,
4,14,"Chris, you should've left for school.
"
,,
4,14,"Shiksa, don't start with me.
"
,,
4,14,"I forgot to go, I should've gone.
"
,,
4,14," Chris, just go.
"
,,
4,14," Mom, relax.
"
,,
4,14,"You look so haggard. Lie down
"
,,
4,14,"or your heart might go...
"
,,
4,14,"Don't worry.
"
,,
4,14,"I got a bunch of great new shows lined up.
"
,,
4,14,"Filmed in front of a live audience.
"
,,
4,14,"My God. Where's my roast pheasant?
"
,,
4,14,"By now I think it's in my lower intestine.
"
,,
4,14,"You ate it? But I told you
"
,,
4,14,"my boss was coming for dinner.
"
,,
4,14,"Unless he likes pork rinds,
"
,,
4,14,"he's going home hungry.
"
,,
4,14,"You cheeky bastard.
"
,,
4,14,"Tonight we'll enjoy
"
,,
4,14,"the smooth jazz of Charles Mingus,
"
,,
4,14,"Norman Mailer will read
"
,,
4,14,"an excerpt from his latest book,
"
,,
4,14,"and we have a girl from Omaha
"
,,
4,14,"who's hiding a banana.
"
,,
4,14,"We'll find out where.
"
,,
4,14,"Giggety giggety, giggety goo. Stick around.
"
,,
4,14,"More fan mail.
"
,,
4,14,"Sheesh, people freakin' love us.
"
,,
4,14,"We'll be huge.
"
,,
4,14,"I want you to cancel that show
"
,,
4,14,"with the animals having sex.
"
,,
4,14,"it's called Dogs Humping.</i>
"
,,
4,14,"It is the cornerstone
"
,,
4,14,"of our Wednesday line-up.
"
,,
4,14,"Responsibility lies with the parents.
"
,,
4,14,"There are worse things for children than TV,
"
,,
4,14,"like when Peter baby-sat the neighbours' kid.
"
,,
4,14,"Couldn't find your toys, so why don't you just
"
,,
4,14,"play with this blow-dryer and these rattles?
"
,,
4,14,"Guess that's it.
"
,,
4,14,"You probably want me out of your hair,
"
,,
4,14,"so here's the Drano in case there's a clog.
"
,,
4,14,"Soap's right there next to the radio,
"
,,
4,14,"and towels are on the roof.
"
,,
4,14,"So, good night.
"
,,
4,14,"It's one thing if a network runs inappropriate
"
,,
4,14,"shows I can't do anything about,
"
,,
4,14,"but I won't have it happening in my house.
"
,,
4,14,"There is absolutely nothing
"
,,
4,14,"inappropriate about my programming.
"
,,
4,14,"All right, Dad, you're on.
"
,,
4,14,"We're here on the I95 overpass doing our first
"
,,
4,14,"segment, ""I Dare You To Crap Off Of That"".
"
,,
4,14,"We'll spend the day crapping off things
"
,,
4,14,"that others have dared us to crap off.
"
,,
4,14," I dared him.
"
,,
4,14," All right. Here we go.
"
,,
4,14,"I say, are those two pigs vomiting up there?
"
,,
4,14,"Before you yell, let me remind you
"
,,
4,14,"that you recklessly drove into oncoming crap.
"
,,
4,14,"It was inexcusable, Peter, and Stewie
"
,,
4,14,"may never be able to ride in the car again.
"
,,
4,14,"Turn off the windshield wipers.
"
,,
4,14,"They don't work. They're making it worse.
"
,,
4,14,"Peter, that's it. I asked you
"
,,
4,14,"to stop this and you didn't listen to me.
"
,,
4,14,"I'm sorry, but you left me no other choice.
"
,,
4,14," I called the FCC.
"
,,
4,14," Oh, yeah. I know all about the FCC.
"
,,
4,14,"They will clean up all your talking
"
,,
4,14,"in a menace such as this
"
,,
4,14,"They will make you take a tinkle
"
,,
4,14,"when you want to take a piss
"
,,
4,14,"And they'll make you call fellatio
"
,,
4,14,"a trouser-friendly kiss
"
,,
4,14,"Here's the plain situation
"
,,
4,14,"There's no negotiation
"
,,
4,14,"with the fellas at the freakin' FCC
"
,,
4,14,"They're as stuffy
"
,,
4,14,"as the stuffiest of special-interest groups
"
,,
4,14,"Make ajoke about your bowels
"
,,
4,14,"and they order in the troops
"
,,
4,14,"Any baby with a brain
"
,,
4,14,"could tell them everybody poops
"
,,
4,14,"Take a tip, take a lesson
"
,,
4,14,"You'll never win
"
,,
4,14,"by messin' with the fellas at the freakin' FCC
"
,,
4,14,"And if you find yourself
"
,,
4,14,"with some young, sexy thing
"
,,
4,14,"You're gonna have to do her
"
,,
4,14,"with your ding-a-ling
"
,,
4,14,"Cos you can't say ""penis""
"
,,
4,14,"So they sent this little warning,
"
,,
4,14,"they're prepared to do their worst
"
,,
4,14,"And they stuck it in your mailbox
"
,,
4,14,"hoping you could be coerced
"
,,
4,14,"I can think of quite another place
"
,,
4,14,"they should have stuck it first
"
,,
4,14,"They may just be neurotic
"
,,
4,14,"Or possibly psychotic
"
,,
4,14,"They're the fellas at the freakin' FCC
"
,,
4,14,"Mr Griffin, that was terrific,
"
,,
4,14,"but I'm here to tell you
"
,,
4,14,"that as of today, PTV is shut down.
"
,,
4,14,"Shut me down, huh?
"
,,
4,14,"Well, you'll have to catch me first.
"
,,
4,14,"Ow! God!
"
,,
4,14,"All right, you caught me.
"
,,
4,14,"We're tired of you infecting people with your
"
,,
4,14,"smut. It's an epidemic. It must be contained.
"
,,
4,14,"Well, Mr FCC, you can stop PTV, but you can
"
,,
4,14,"never stop people from being who they are.
"
,,
4,14,"Or can we?
"
,,
4,14," What are you doing?
"
,,
4,14," Censoring real life.
"
,,
4,14,"His chin looks like balls.
"
,,
4,14,"Want me to cover that too?
"
,,
4,14,"How long will you be censoring us?
"
,,
4,14,"Until you and all of Quahog
"
,,
4,14,"start to clean up your act,
"
,,
4,14,"like when Ozzy Osbourne
"
,,
4,14,"stopped biting heads off bats.
"
,,
4,14,"Before I start playing,
"
,,
4,14,"I'm gonna eat this whole sandwich.
"
,,
4,14,"I'll finish it later.
"
,,
4,14,"Lois, these eggs are scrambled. I thought for
"
,,
4,14,"sure you'd be making eggs Benedict Arnold.
"
,,
4,14,"Brian, stop writing jokes for Peter.
"
,,
4,14,"You brought this on yourself
"
,,
4,14,"by putting on those filthy shows.
"
,,
4,14,"Lois, you are so full of...
"
,,
4,14,"What? Now I can't say...
"
,,
4,14,"in my own... house?
"
,,
4,14,"Great, Lois. Just great.
"
,,
4,14,"You know, you're lucky
"
,,
4,14,"you're good at... my...
"
,,
4,14,"You know what I mean - when you...
"
,,
4,14,"lubed up... toothpaste in my...
"
,,
4,14,"cherry... Episcopalian...
"
,,
4,14,"extension cord... wetness...
"
,,
4,14,"with a parking ticket - that is the best.
"
,,
4,14," What is this?
"
,,
4,14," The FCC has forbidden audible flatulence.
"
,,
4,14,"Everyone must wear this device that converts
"
,,
4,14,"all fart sounds into Steven Wrightjokes.
"
,,
4,14,"I spilt spot remover
"
,,
4,14,"on my dog. Now he's gone.
"
,,
4,14,"This is bogus.
"
,,
4,14,"Two shakes. That's it. Move along.
"
,,
4,14,"Why, thank you, tinkle fairy.
"
,,
4,14,"Lois, you ruined everything.
"
,,
4,14,"I know it's a little extreme,
"
,,
4,14,"but when it comes to our children,
"
,,
4,14,"it's better to err on the safe side, right?
"
,,
4,14,"No. You know, if everybody
"
,,
4,14,"was as closed-minded as you,
"
,,
4,14,"the world wouldn't have
"
,,
4,14,"some of its most inspired creations.
"
,,
4,14,"Man, this chocolate bar is delicious.
"
,,
4,14,"Yeah, I love peanut butter.
"
,,
4,14," I'm Officer Reeses. What happened here?
"
,,
4,14," He got peanut butter on my chocolate.
"
,,
4,14,"He got chocolate in my peanut butter.
"
,,
4,14,"Come on.
"
,,
4,14,"I know what'll make you feel better.
"
,,
4,14,"How about a little angry sex?
"
,,
4,14,"All right.
"
,,
4,14,"Whoa. Those actions
"
,,
4,14,"are highly inappropriate.
"
,,
4,14,"What? Wait, we're not allowed to have sex?
"
,,
4,14,"You can have sex, just no moaning,
"
,,
4,14,"no tongue kissing, no thrusting,
"
,,
4,14,"no movement whatsoever.
"
,,
4,14,"This isn't very romantic.
"
,,
4,14,"How are we supposed...?
"
,,
4,14,"I'm done. Night, Lois.
"
,,
4,14,"Come on, you son of a...
"
,,
4,14,"...me.
"
,,
4,14," Brian, would you mind?
"
,,
4,14," Yeah, sure.
"
,,
4,14,"Sorry. I haven't had sex in two weeks.
"
,,
4,14,"I'm just a little on edge lately.
"
,,
4,14,"There wasn't this much tension
"
,,
4,14,"when the slaves were freed.
"
,,
4,14,"OK, so you're free to go.
"
,,
4,14,"But we're cool, right?
"
,,
4,14,"Peter, we have to talk.
"
,,
4,14,"I thought this FCC thing was a good idea
"
,,
4,14,"at first, but it's just gone way too far.
"
,,
4,14,"What are you saying, Lois?
"
,,
4,14,"Well, I don't want to admit it,
"
,,
4,14,"but I think you were right.
"
,,
4,14,"I don't believe it. Finally I can do this.
"
,,
4,14,"I set that thing up 15 years ago.
"
,,
4,14,"Hey, where's the clown?
"
,,
4,14,"We've gotta do something about this. Pack
"
,,
4,14,"your bag, Peter. We're going to Washington.
"
,,
4,14,"There he is.
"
,,
4,14," Are we there yet?
"
,,
4,14," No, honey, we're not.
"
,,
4,14," Are we there yet?
"
,,
4,14," No, Chris.
"
,,
4,14," Are we there yet?
"
,,
4,14," Yes, Chris. OK? We're there.
"
,,
4,14,"Liar!
"
,,
4,14,"do whatever Oprah tells you to.</i>
"
,,
4,14,"This book's been around for 50 years.
"
,,
4,14,"It's a classic.
"
,,
4,14,"You just got it last week.
"
,,
4,14,"There's an Oprah sticker on it.
"
,,
4,14,"Is that what that is? Let me peel that right off.
"
,,
4,14," What will you read after that?
"
,,
4,14," She hasn't told us yet. Damn!
"
,,
4,14,"And the motion carries.
"
,,
4,14,"The janitor's new nickname is Sweepy.
"
,,
4,14,"Gentlemen, that was a fart.
"
,,
4,14," What's going on?
"
,,
4,14," I'll tell you what's going on.
"
,,
4,14,"This government's FCC is trying
"
,,
4,14,"to take the farts away from television,
"
,,
4,14,"and all the sex and nudity and all the poop.
"
,,
4,14,"Well, I say it's wrong. These things
"
,,
4,14,"are part of the fabric of American life.
"
,,
4,14,"We appreciate your passion,
"
,,
4,14,"but this Congress supports the FCC.
"
,,
4,14,"Indecency is un-American.
"
,,
4,14,"Yeah? Well, I can prove to you
"
,,
4,14,"that that's a bunch of bull. Look around you.
"
,,
4,14,"The Washington Monument. Looks
"
,,
4,14,"an awful lot like a penis, doesn't it?
"
,,
4,14,"The Capitol Building -
"
,,
4,14,"quite obviously a giant boob.
"
,,
4,14,"And the Pentagon? Well, you look me in the
"
,,
4,14,"eye and tell me it doesn't look like a big anus.
"
,,
4,14,"My God! How could we have been so blind?
"
,,
4,14,"He's right. Have you ever
"
,,
4,14,"looked closely at the Lincoln Memorial?
"
,,
4,14,"Our top story, the FCC's content ban
"
,,
4,14,"on Quahog has finally been lifted.
"
,,
4,14," Well, you did it, Peter. You beat the FCC.
"
,,
4,14," Shh, Lois.
"
,,
4,14,"Look what I did. Isn't it the biggest,
"
,,
4,14,"most super-special poop you've ever seen?
"
,,
4,14,"Well, Cindy, I guess it's true
"
,,
4,14,"that big things come in small packages.

,,
4,15,"Brian.
"
,,
4,15,"calling from The New Yorker.</i>
"
,,
4,15," Perhaps you've heard of us?
"
,,
4,15," Yeah, of course I've heard of you.
"
,,
4,15,"a homeless person and I saw your article.</i>
"
,,
4,15,"We'd love to talk to you about
"
,,
4,15,"becoming a contributor. Come by tomorrow.
"
,,
4,15,"Wow, yeah, that'd be great.
"
,,
4,15,"to contribute to The New Yorker.</i>
"
,,
4,15,"as well as I did at Woodstock.</i>
"
,,
4,15,"Excuse me, it's been brought to my attention
"
,,
4,15,"that a few bad apples are smoking marijuana.
"
,,
4,15,"I've got news for you, my friend.
"
,,
4,15,"Marijuana's illegal.
"
,,
4,15,"Not cool. All right, then.
"
,,
4,15," You suck!
"
,,
4,15," Learn the rules!
"
,,
4,15,"Our writers' lounge,
"
,,
4,15,"where you'll meet some contributors.
"
,,
4,15," Fielding Wellingtonsworth.
"
,,
4,15," Hello.
"
,,
4,15," Livingston Winstofford.
"
,,
4,15," Yes.
"
,,
4,15," Amelia Bedford-Furthington-Chesterhill.
"
,,
4,15," Good day.
"
,,
4,15,"And James William Bottomtooth.
"
,,
4,15," This is Brian, our newest contributor.
"
,,
4,15," Hi, there. How's it going?
"
,,
4,15," Would you like some tea?
"
,,
4,15," Cigar?
"
,,
4,15,"Brandy?
"
,,
4,15," No, I'm good, thanks.
"
,,
4,15," We read your article, Brian.
"
,,
4,15,"Your study in postmodern American
"
,,
4,15,"subcultures was quite illuminating.
"
,,
4,15,"Wow, thanks.
"
,,
4,15,"That means a lot coming from you guys.
"
,,
4,15,"I'm sorry?
"
,,
4,15,"Yes?
"
,,
4,15," Is there a bathroom around here?
"
,,
4,15," Yes, yes, follow me.
"
,,
4,15," No one at The New Yorker has an anus.</i>
"
,,
4,15,"Peter, it's been two weeks. Don't you think
"
,,
4,15,"it's time to take off your A-Team costume?
"
,,
4,15,"Yeah, I guess so, but part of me wished we
"
,,
4,15,"could just be the A-Team forever, you know?
"
,,
4,15,"Oh, this damn chair keeps wobbling.
"
,,
4,15,"I think one of the legs is short.
"
,,
4,15," Lance, I told you to fix that chair.
"
,,
4,15," I checked it earlier. It seems fine.
"
,,
4,15,"That chair's always like that. We'll help you.
"
,,
4,15,"Wow, thanks.
"
,,
4,15,"Hey, if we could fix that wobbly chair, think
"
,,
4,15,"of what else we could do for our community.
"
,,
4,15,"Cleveland's right. It seems it's our destiny
"
,,
4,15,"to be the A-Team after all.
"
,,
4,15,"We're the A-Team, yeah!
"
,,
4,15,"In 2005, a group of local misfits won
"
,,
4,15,"a costume contest at an '80s TV convention.
"
,,
4,15,"These men promptly returned home
"
,,
4,15,"and drank some beer.
"
,,
4,15,"Today they survive as soldiers of fortune.
"
,,
4,15,"If you have a problem, if no one else can help,
"
,,
4,15,"and if you can find them,
"
,,
4,15,"maybe you can hire the A-Team.
"
,,
4,15,"Labor Day? What, do you work for Esquire?""</i>
"
,,
4,15,"Oh, Brian, how droll.
"
,,
4,15,"We'll have to put that into a cartoon,
"
,,
4,15,"or as we call it,
"
,,
4,15,"an illustrated laughing square.
"
,,
4,15,"You went to Harvard? I'm an Ivy-League man
"
,,
4,15,"myself. I went to Brown.
"
,,
4,15,"My incarcerated business partner's retarded
"
,,
4,15,"gay niece went to Brown. What year?
"
,,
4,15,"Well, I mean, I didn't technically graduate.
"
,,
4,15,"You're a college dropout?
"
,,
4,15,"your kind. You, sir, are fired.</i>
"
,,
4,15,"I can't believe they fired you. How come you
"
,,
4,15,"never told us you dropped out of college?
"
,,
4,15,"It didn't work out too well for Kristy
"
,,
4,15,"McNichol, but then again, nothing did.
"
,,
4,15,"I was only one course shy of graduating
"
,,
4,15,"and I just cracked under the pressure.
"
,,
4,15,"Now itjust cost me the bestjob I ever had.
"
,,
4,15,"Don't take it too hard.
"
,,
4,15,"You're not the first person to get fired.
"
,,
4,15,"Louis, the French people really
"
,,
4,15,"wanna thank you for your services as king,
"
,,
4,15,"but, it's just not working out
"
,,
4,15,"and we've decided to go another way, so...
"
,,
4,15,"Yeah.
"
,,
4,15,"I just heard the dog got fired.
"
,,
4,15,"Did I miss it? Did he cry yet?
"
,,
4,15,"Oh, come on, dog. cry for me.
"
,,
4,15,"Ah, there you are.
"
,,
4,15,"Oh, yeah, cry for Stewie.
"
,,
4,15,"Life isn't what you thought it would be.
"
,,
4,15,"Boy, not graduating from college
"
,,
4,15,"has haunted me for years.
"
,,
4,15,"Well, if you only had one class left
"
,,
4,15,"why don't you just go back and finish?
"
,,
4,15," Plenty of people do that.
"
,,
4,15," You know, that's not a bad idea.
"
,,
4,15,"Well, this is boring.
"
,,
4,15,"Let's go see what Meg is up to.
"
,,
4,15,"Hello, Meg...
"
,,
4,15," What are you doing here?
"
,,
4,15," Are you kidding?
"
,,
4,15,"Miss watching you crash and burn in
"
,,
4,15,"this misguided attempt to finish college?
"
,,
4,15,"You're not staying. I'll call Lois
"
,,
4,15,"and have her pick you up.
"
,,
4,15,"Hi, I'm your roommate Caleb.
"
,,
4,15,"I like cutting myself.
"
,,
4,15,"I bleed a lot. Can I have the top bunk?
"
,,
4,15,"He already has a roommate - me.
"
,,
4,15,"We're a couple of crazy college kooks.
"
,,
4,15,"We're about to make a hilarious
"
,,
4,15,"answering-machine message.
"
,,
4,15,"You've reached Stewie and Brian.
"
,,
4,15,"We're not here right now.
"
,,
4,15,"If this is Mom, send money
"
,,
4,15,"because we're college students
"
,,
4,15,"and we need money
"
,,
4,15,"for books and highlighters
"
,,
4,15,"and ramen noodles and condoms
"
,,
4,15,"for sexual relations with our classmates.
"
,,
4,15,"All right, fine, you can stay,
"
,,
4,15,"but what do I tell Lois?
"
,,
4,15,"You don't have to tell her.
"
,,
4,15,"Gary Coleman owed me a favour.
"
,,
4,15," Stewie, you want more strained peas?
"
,,
4,15," What you talkin' 'bout, vile woman?
"
,,
4,15,"There she is, boys, all done.
"
,,
4,15,"The A-Team is ready to help rid the world
"
,,
4,15,"of injustice and evil.
"
,,
4,15,"Yeah!
"
,,
4,15," All right!
"
,,
4,15," Yeah!
"
,,
4,15,"Let's do it!
"
,,
4,15,"This is advanced physics, right?
"
,,
4,15,"I have a right to defend myself as a woman!
"
,,
4,15," No means no!
"
,,
4,15," What the hell is wrong with you?
"
,,
4,15,"I'm sorry. I just came from that
"
,,
4,15,"orientation seminar about college dating.
"
,,
4,15,"Hi, I'm Kelly McGillis,
"
,,
4,15,"and I'm here to talk to you about rape.
"
,,
4,15,"Ladies, look to your left.
"
,,
4,15,"Now look to your right.
"
,,
4,15,"Statistics indicate
"
,,
4,15,"that both of those men will rape you.
"
,,
4,15," I'm not gonna rape you.
"
,,
4,15," I might.
"
,,
4,15," Good morning, class.
"
,,
4,15," Can I borrow a pencil?
"
,,
4,15," Now, now, it looks like we have a comedian.
"
,,
4,15," I wasn't making ajoke, I was just asking...
"
,,
4,15,"Now, Louie Anderson, our first test is Friday,
"
,,
4,15,"and if you don't pass you are out of the class.
"
,,
4,15,"Fluffy! Fluffy, come down!
"
,,
4,15,"Oh, Mommy, Daddy, what are we gonna do?
"
,,
4,15,"Don't you worry, sad little girl. The A-Team'll
"
,,
4,15,"get your beloved kitty down. Ready, boys?
"
,,
4,15," No need to thank us, it's what we do.
"
,,
4,15," Who the hell are you guys?
"
,,
4,15,"We're the A-Team.
"
,,
4,15," Get off my property!
"
,,
4,15," Yeah, that's probably a good idea. Let's go.
"
,,
4,15,"What do you think?
"
,,
4,15,"I got this at the school store.
"
,,
4,15,"I think it's called Crazy Stairs.</i>
"
,,
4,15,"Look, Stewie, I gotta finish this assignment
"
,,
4,15,"or I'm gonna fail this class.
"
,,
4,15," All done.
"
,,
4,15," What? I can't use this. It'd be cheating.
"
,,
4,15,"Fine. I'll be out on the quad. You know what
"
,,
4,15,"I've discovered since I've been in college?
"
,,
4,15,"I am so all about Ultimate Frisbee.
"
,,
4,15,"I graded your assignments.
"
,,
4,15,"Clearly there is only one person here
"
,,
4,15,"who understands the material - Brian Griffin.
"
,,
4,15,"Just got lucky, I guess.
"
,,
4,15,"No, Brian, I underestimated you.
"
,,
4,15,"Here, let me put a smiley face on your test.
"
,,
4,15,"May I borrow your pen?
"
,,
4,15,"You... Do you...
"
,,
4,15,"Do you want me to just stick it in there?
"
,,
4,15,"Yes.
"
,,
4,15,"There. You have earned that.
"
,,
4,15," Hey, what's up B-Ri?
"
,,
4,15," Stewie, just give me a beer.
"
,,
4,15,"I've had a bad day.
"
,,
4,15,"I cheated on that assignment.
"
,,
4,15,"You know, I haven't taken a shower since we
"
,,
4,15,"got here. I totally reek, man. Check this out.
"
,,
4,15," Come on!
"
,,
4,15," Tell me that's not epic.
"
,,
4,15,"I didn't come back to college to cheat
"
,,
4,15,"my way through. I wanted to do it on my own.
"
,,
4,15,"Will you relax? Plenty of people cheat.
"
,,
4,15,"Once again, Ashlee Simpson.
"
,,
4,15,"Mom, look. They're tearing down
"
,,
4,15,"Roger Williams Park to build a strip mall.
"
,,
4,15,"Oh, no, I take Stewie there all the time,
"
,,
4,15,"don't I, sweetie?
"
,,
4,15,"Victory shall be mine.
"
,,
4,15,"That's where I go to make out with
"
,,
4,15,"my boyfriend, Darren Mitchellstork.
"
,,
4,15,"Yeah, he's the chairman
"
,,
4,15,"of the soccer ball team.
"
,,
4,15,"Well, all right. Make sure
"
,,
4,15,"you practise safe sex, Meg.
"
,,
4,15,"You little liar!
"
,,
4,15,"Roger Williams Park?
"
,,
4,15,"That sounds like ajob for the A-Team.
"
,,
4,15," Hi, Dad!
"
,,
4,15," Go to your room.
"
,,
4,15,"OK.
"
,,
4,15,"Ah, Brian, I am glad you could come
"
,,
4,15,"to my faculty cocktail party.
"
,,
4,15,"Let me introduce my wife, Helen.
"
,,
4,15,"Dammit, Steve, you forgot
"
,,
4,15,"to put out the cheese and crackers.
"
,,
4,15,"Helen, don't start with me
"
,,
4,15,"in front of our guests.
"
,,
4,15,"Do you think I like hitting you?
"
,,
4,15,"I am sorry you had to see that.
"
,,
4,15,"Look, sir, I need to confess something.
"
,,
4,15,"That assignment I turned in...
"
,,
4,15,"You know, Brian,
"
,,
4,15,"before you came along I was so depressed
"
,,
4,15,"I was planning to kill myself.
"
,,
4,15,"But you have inspired me.
"
,,
4,15,"If you can learn, maybe one day I can walk.
"
,,
4,15,"Now, what was it you wanted to say?
"
,,
4,15,"Nothing.
"
,,
4,15,"You were supposed to get potato chips,
"
,,
4,15,"you jackass.
"
,,
4,15,"Dammit, Helen, get the hell off my back
"
,,
4,15,"or so help me... so help me...
"
,,
4,15,"Don't worry.
"
,,
4,15,"I hear they have great make-up sex.
"
,,
4,15," Oh, that feels so good.
"
,,
4,15," Oh, oh, oh. Oh, yeah. Like that.
"
,,
4,15," Oh, baby.
"
,,
4,15," I thought about this all day.
"
,,
4,15,"Not so fast. You are hurting me.
"
,,
4,15," All right.
"
,,
4,15," Stewie, come on, we're going home.
"
,,
4,15," What are you talking about?
"
,,
4,15," My final exam is tomorrow.
"
,,
4,15,"Only way I'll pass is if I cheat. If I do, what
"
,,
4,15,"was the point of coming back to college?
"
,,
4,15,"We can't leave. It's almost half-time,
"
,,
4,15,"and we all pooped in the tuba.
"
,,
4,15,"OK, we can go.
"
,,
4,15,"Hey, what are you guys doing?
"
,,
4,15,"This is ajob site.
"
,,
4,15,"No, it's not. It's Roger Williams Park and
"
,,
4,15,"we're here to stop you from destroying it.
"
,,
4,15,"Whoa! What are you gonna do? Kill us?
"
,,
4,15,"Oh, no, no. We wouldn't do that.
"
,,
4,15,"We'll probably shoot the ground around you
"
,,
4,15,"to make you scared.
"
,,
4,15,"Then you'll jump in your truck, speed off,
"
,,
4,15,"hit something and do a flip.
"
,,
4,15," That'd kill us.
"
,,
4,15," No, you'll just roll out and dust yourself off
"
,,
4,15,"and lumber to your hideout, defeated.
"
,,
4,15,"I had a cousin got in a fender-bender
"
,,
4,15,"at five miles an hour.
"
,,
4,15,"Messed his neck up, he's got partial
"
,,
4,15,"numbness, he's just not the same guy.
"
,,
4,15," Was he wearing his safety belt?
"
,,
4,15," Thank God.
"
,,
4,15,"Yeah, cos I know this guy
"
,,
4,15,"who took his car in for an oil change.
"
,,
4,15,"Later he got in a wreck
"
,,
4,15,"and the air bag didn't deploy.
"
,,
4,15," Turns out they stole it, sold it for spares.
"
,,
4,15," No way.
"
,,
4,15,"It happens. They call 'em chop shops.
"
,,
4,15,"Makes it harder to track stolen parts.
"
,,
4,15,"Jeez, that is awful.
"
,,
4,15,"Well, you got a lot of work to do.
"
,,
4,15,"We should get out of your hair.
"
,,
4,15," Take it easy, now.
"
,,
4,15," Yeah, see you.
"
,,
4,15,"Be sure to put your tools away.
"
,,
4,15," We blew it, didn't we?
"
,,
4,15," Boy, you can say that again.
"
,,
4,15,"We were ready to save Roger Williams Park
"
,,
4,15,"and we got sidetracked by idle conversation.
"
,,
4,15," We're a terrible A-Team.
"
,,
4,15," The problem is we didn't stay focused.
"
,,
4,15,"That's exactly it. We didn't stay focused.
"
,,
4,15,"I mean, we were right there,
"
,,
4,15,"and then we just...
"
,,
4,15,"Somehow we just... I mean... It...
"
,,
4,15,"It's been said. We didn't stay focused.
"
,,
4,15," Hey, Mrs Garrett, can I ask you something?
"
,,
4,15," What is it, Jo?
"
,,
4,15,"Is it a problem
"
,,
4,15,"if your penis and your vagina touch?
"
,,
4,15,"What?
"
,,
4,15,"I try to keep 'em separated, but I woke up
"
,,
4,15,"this morning and they were sort of together.
"
,,
4,15," I just didn't know. Is that OK?
"
,,
4,15," You have both?
"
,,
4,15," Well, yeah, doesn't everybody?
"
,,
4,15," No!
"
,,
4,15,"Brian, what are you doing home?
"
,,
4,15,"I couldn't do it.
"
,,
4,15,"I thought I'd be able to finish this time,
"
,,
4,15,"but I just don't have what it takes
"
,,
4,15,"to be a college graduate.
"
,,
4,15,"But you're so close.
"
,,
4,15,"I mean, your final exam's tomorrow.
"
,,
4,15,"You can't give up. You could study tonight.
"
,,
4,15,"I think if you work at it...
"
,,
4,15,"Lois, Lois. It's over, all right?
"
,,
4,15,"I'm not going.
"
,,
4,15,"Well, whatever you say.
"
,,
4,15," Hey, what's in this closet?
"
,,
4,15," What are you doing?
"
,,
4,15," Well, my my. Mr Hoover's come to visit.
"
,,
4,15," I don't wanna see Mr Hoover.
"
,,
4,15,"I wonder if Mr Hoover has anything
"
,,
4,15,"to say about this.
"
,,
4,15,"This is not funny.
"
,,
4,15,"I don't wanna see Mr Hoover.
"
,,
4,15,"Stop! Stop it! Stop it! It's scaring me!
"
,,
4,15,"Leave me alone! It's so loud!
"
,,
4,15," Stop! Stop it! All right, OK, I'll study!
"
,,
4,15," I'll help you if you want.
"
,,
4,15,"No thanks, Lois.
"
,,
4,15,"There's only one person who can help me.
"
,,
4,15,"Drago!
"
,,
4,15," The exam's in three hours.
"
,,
4,15," Crap. All we did was work out.
"
,,
4,15," We should study.
"
,,
4,15," Right.
"
,,
4,15,"You're not wearing your costume any more.
"
,,
4,15,"What's the point? I thought I could
"
,,
4,15,"help people with this A-Team thing,
"
,,
4,15,"that nude Playboy spread of Debbie Gibson.</i>
"
,,
4,15,"It's like, ""She's naked, but who gives a shit?""
"
,,
4,15,"Oh, my God, I overslept.
"
,,
4,15,"My exam's in 20 minutes.
"
,,
4,15,"Brian, you'll never make it.
"
,,
4,15,"Unless there was some kind of team
"
,,
4,15,"of people who could get you there in time.
"
,,
4,15,"Peter, do you know anybody like that?
"
,,
4,15,"You may start your exam...
"
,,
4,15,"now.
"
,,
4,15," Well, how'd you do?
"
,,
4,15," I failed.
"
,,
4,15," What? You failed?
"
,,
4,15," Yep.
"
,,
4,15," What are you smiling for?
"
,,
4,15," Because I took it all the way.
"
,,
4,15,"I didn't give up on myself, and I didn't cheat.
"
,,
4,15," You probably should have.
"
,,
4,15," Yeah.
"
,,
4,15," You would've been better off.
"
,,
4,15," What were you thinking?
"
,,
4,15,"Doesn't matter how it turned out.
"
,,
4,15,"I finished what I started,

4,15," I don't understand.

"
,,
4,15,"I am so bored.
"
,,
4,15,"When you take a break from your lipstick,
"
,,
4,15,"how about taking me to the park?
"
,,
4,15,"My lipstick? What...?
"
,,
4,15,"Right. Right. Right, because of my penis.
"
,,
4,15,"Yeah, that's fantastic.
"
,,
4,15,"Lois, Brian won't take me to the park.
"
,,
4,15,"Then he talked about his ding-dong. Lois.
"
,,
4,15,"Lois. Dammit, woman, pay attention to me.
"
,,
4,15,"Stewie, that's not nice. Don't grab Mommy's
"
,,
4,15,"pants like that. You could really hurt her.
"
,,
4,15,"Yes, I could, couldn't I? I could hurt Mommy.
"
,,
4,15,"Shame on us, Rupert. How dare we succumb
"
,,
4,15,"to boredom while she continues to breathe?
"
,,
4,15,"She must be destroyed.
"
,,
4,15,"With Lois out of the way,
"
,,
4,15,"I could focus on my life's ambition
"
,,
4,15,"of taking pictures of Madison County.
"
,,
4,15," Let's go back and take a bath.
"
,,
4,15," How about you go back and take a bath?
"
,,
4,15," Have you filed those reports yet?
"
,,
4,15," Angela, come here. Check this out.
"
,,
4,15,"Look at what this chick is doing
"
,,
4,15,"to this polar bear. Wait. Wait. It's...
"
,,
4,15,"Wait. Wait. Wait, it's coming up.
"
,,
4,15,"There you are, Opie. Congratulations.
"
,,
4,15,"You made employee of the month again.
"
,,
4,16,"How come I'm never employee of the month?
"
,,
4,16,"It's the worstjob since the Sand People choir.
"
,,
4,16,"And a one, and a two...
"
,,
4,16,"No. The altos were early.
"
,,
4,16,"This is the worst glee club I've ever...
"
,,
4,16,"Come on. Where are you going?
"
,,
4,16,"The benefit's tomorrow.
"
,,
4,16,"Relax. They frighten easily,
"
,,
4,16,"but they'll be back. And in greater numbers.
"
,,
4,16," That'll give us a richer harmony.
"
,,
4,16," It's gonna sound fantastic.
"
,,
4,16,"Help! Somebody! I'm blacking out!
"
,,
4,16,"Brian, help me!
"
,,
4,16,"Thatjerk Opie got employee of the month
"
,,
4,16,"again because my boss hates me.
"
,,
4,16,"Maybe you need to
"
,,
4,16,"brown-nose her a little bit, Peter.
"
,,
4,16,"Really? I thought you said she was ugly.
"
,,
4,16,"Oh, you mean kiss up to her.
"
,,
4,16," That's a great idea, Joe.
"
,,
4,16," If that doesn't do it, work hard and be polite.
"
,,
4,16,"That's how I won friends
"
,,
4,16,"when I worked for E!.
"
,,
4,16,"Seabiscuit. Would you mind talking to E!?
"
,,
4,16,"I'm not Seabiscuit, I'm Penlope Cruz.
"
,,
4,16,"And you're just lovely.
"
,,
4,16,"Would you like a carrot?
"
,,
4,16,"Good girl.
"
,,
4,16,"Brown-nose?
"
,,
4,16,"All right. I'll do something special for her.
"
,,
4,16," Surprise!
"
,,
4,16," What the hell are you doing at my house?
"
,,
4,16,"I asked around and everybody said you liked
"
,,
4,16,"animals, so I organised a surprise cockfight.
"
,,
4,16,"Oh, boy.
"
,,
4,16,"Oh, God.
"
,,
4,16,"Well, it looks like they killed each other.
"
,,
4,16,"That was probably
"
,,
4,16,"what all that racket was about an hour ago.
"
,,
4,16,"Well, I will see you Monday.
"
,,
4,16,"Oh, crap.
"
,,
4,16,"Well, looks like the good Lord
"
,,
4,16,"just sent me a conversation starter.
"
,,
4,16,"Come here, Jesse. Come get the ball.
"
,,
4,16,"How unfortunate.
"
,,
4,16,"Stewie's really been acting out a lot at home
"
,,
4,16,"and I was just wondering,
"
,,
4,16,"how's he been behaving at school?
"
,,
4,16,"Mrs Griffin, let me show you
"
,,
4,16,"some pictures he drew in class.
"
,,
4,16," Notice anything unusual?
"
,,
4,16," I sure do. His father's not in any of them.
"
,,
4,16," Exactly.
"
,,
4,16," Peter's been preoccupied with work lately.
"
,,
4,16,"I guess Stewie's been missing his father.
"
,,
4,16,"Thank you for letting me know.
"
,,
4,16,"Damn! She moved. I suppose it's not the
"
,,
4,16,"first time someone's made a miscalculation.
"
,,
4,16," What happens to us in the future?
"
,,
4,16," It's your kids. Something's gotta be done.
"
,,
4,16," What do you mean?
"
,,
4,16," Your daughter marries a black man.
"
,,
4,16," That's actually not a big deal for me.
"
,,
4,16," Yeah. Me neither.
"
,,
4,16,"Well, it... You... Really?
"
,,
4,16," Yeah. I mean, what's wrong with that?
"
,,
4,16," Nothing. It's nothing, I guess.
"
,,
4,16," I think it's great. Congratulations.
"
,,
4,16," I don't think I'm comfortable around you.
"
,,
4,16," Peanut butter was invented by a black man.
"
,,
4,16," Too late, Doc.
"
,,
4,16,"Hi, Herbert. What brings you here?
"
,,
4,16,"It seems your son's baseball
"
,,
4,16,"broke one of my windows the other day.
"
,,
4,16,"Oh, my God. I am so sorry.
"
,,
4,16,"Chris, this is gonna
"
,,
4,16,"come out of your allowance.
"
,,
4,16,"Perhaps we could work something out.
"
,,
4,16,"I could use a strapping young man
"
,,
4,16,"to do some chores around my house.
"
,,
4,16,"That seems fair to me.
"
,,
4,16,"You have damaged this man's property.
"
,,
4,16,"Until you pay off the debt,
"
,,
4,16,"you'll do whateverjob he wants you to.
"
,,
4,16,"At the end of the day, if you're exhausted and
"
,,
4,16,"your face is wet, it means you did a good job.
"
,,
4,16,"That sounds fine.
"
,,
4,16,"I don't want to spend my weekend
"
,,
4,16,"doing chores.
"
,,
4,16,"Chris, a little hard work can do wonders.
"
,,
4,16,"Just look at how they built the pyramids.
"
,,
4,16,"All peoples must go through hard times.
"
,,
4,16,"We Jews are getting ours out of the way early.
"
,,
4,16,"From hereon out,
"
,,
4,16,"it's gonna be nothing but smooth sailing.
"
,,
4,16," I have an announcement to make.
"
,,
4,16," Don't you do it. Don't lose a single pound.
"
,,
4,16,"I don't care what Hollywood
"
,,
4,16,"imagemakers say. Big women are sexy.
"
,,
4,16,"I wanted to tell you Opie will not be receiving
"
,,
4,16,"employee of the month. He's being promoted.
"
,,
4,16,"Yes! That means I'm employee of the month.
"
,,
4,16,"No, you're not, Griffin.
"
,,
4,16,"I'm giving it to Soundwave.
"
,,
4,16,"So I can just put my stuff anywhere?
"
,,
4,16,"My wife, Denise.
"
,,
4,16,"We met in a Christian chat room.
"
,,
4,16," We need to talk about your son.
"
,,
4,16," The fat one or the funny-looking one?
"
,,
4,16,"Dad called you fat. Wait.
"
,,
4,16,"Stewie's been acting out. I think
"
,,
4,16,"it's cos he's not spending time with you.
"
,,
4,16,"It's time you take an interest. Starting today,
"
,,
4,16,"I want you to spend more time with Stewie.
"
,,
4,16,"OK. You can make a box fort. See?
"
,,
4,16,"Here's a box. You can pretend it's a fort.
"
,,
4,16,"Actually, that sounds like fun.
"
,,
4,16,"I want this. I'm king in here.
"
,,
4,16,"Peter, maybe Stewie
"
,,
4,16,"would like to play fort too.
"
,,
4,16,"No. If you need me, I'll be in space.
"
,,
4,16,"Great idea bringing Stewie here.
"
,,
4,16,"There's no better place for a father and son
"
,,
4,16,"to get to know each other than a ball game.
"
,,
4,16,"Where is Stewie?
"
,,
4,16," Is that a baby in there?
"
,,
4,16," Oh, my God. He's gonna miss the game.
"
,,
4,16,"Hey, remember those hot homeless twins
"
,,
4,16,"who live under the overpass? Last night...
"
,,
4,16,"Wait, Quagmire. Let me cover Stewie's ears.
"
,,
4,16,"And this is the hand
"
,,
4,16,"that caused all the trouble.
"
,,
4,16,"Got your nose, little guy.
"
,,
4,16,"Peter, did you take Stewie to a strip club?
"
,,
4,16,"He smells like sweat and fear.
"
,,
4,16,"Let me tell you, Tuesday afternoon is not
"
,,
4,16,"exactly their A squad. I saw bullet wounds.
"
,,
4,16,"You can'tjust take him places you want to go.
"
,,
4,16,"He's a baby.
"
,,
4,16,"I think I know how to spend time
"
,,
4,16,"with my own kid, all right?
"
,,
4,16,"The bond between a father and son is sacred.
"
,,
4,16,"I'm sorry, Jesus, but my house, my rules.
"
,,
4,16,"Up yours, Joseph. You're not my real dad.
"
,,
4,16," Hello?
"
,,
4,16," Hey, Dad. It's me.
"
,,
4,16,"Listen, things here aren't working out
"
,,
4,16,"any more, and I was wondering,
"
,,
4,16,"can I come live with you and Janet
"
,,
4,16,"for a while?
"
,,
4,16,"Wow, kiddo. You know, I'd love that,
"
,,
4,16,"but I don't know if now is the best time.
"
,,
4,16,"Maybe next year, OK? I'll see you Friday
"
,,
4,16,"night. Tell your mother I sent the cheque.
"
,,
4,16," So where were we?
"
,,
4,16," Right about here.
"
,,
4,16," Come on, baby. It's my birthday.
"
,,
4,16," No.
"
,,
4,16,"All I'm saying is that you just need to find
"
,,
4,16,"an activity that you and Stewie can share.
"
,,
4,16,"Peter, can you reach that box of rice?
"
,,
4,16,"Sorry, Lois.
"
,,
4,16,"That rice got you, bitch.
"
,,
4,16,"He's laughing.
"
,,
4,16,"You think that's funny? You like that?
"
,,
4,16,"Lois, you want some beans with that rice?
"
,,
4,16,"I misjudged you, fat man.
"
,,
4,16," Dammit. Peter, what's wrong with you?
"
,,
4,16," Wait, Lois, don't move. Stewie's loving this.
"
,,
4,16,"See if she's got any cash on her.
"
,,
4,16,"OK, Stewie. Get the camera ready.
"
,,
4,16,"Peter, stop it. What the hell are you doing?
"
,,
4,16,"What do you think I'm doing?
"
,,
4,16,"I'm bonding with Stewie.
"
,,
4,16,"There is nothing more precious
"
,,
4,16,"than a baby's laughter.
"
,,
4,16," I hope she can get out.
"
,,
4,16," I'm sure she'll be fine.
"
,,
4,16,"Well, hello there, young man.
"
,,
4,16,"I was starting to think you weren't coming.
"
,,
4,16,"Sorry I'm late, Mr Herbert.
"
,,
4,16,"Well, I guess I'll get started.
"
,,
4,16,"You know, if you get sweaty and want to
"
,,
4,16,"take your shirt off, that'd be just fine.
"
,,
4,16,"Or tie it in a knot. Your choice.
"
,,
4,16,"We go live to Ollie Williams
"
,,
4,16,"in the Channel 5 traffic copter.
"
,,
4,16," Ollie?
"
,,
4,16," Everybody looks like ants.
"
,,
4,16,"Probably cos you're up so high.
"
,,
4,16,"Coming up, an interview with Andrew Shue.
"
,,
4,16,"Hey, Dad. Pull my finger. Wait.
"
,,
4,16,"Sounded like a peeptoad, but it's not summer.
"
,,
4,16,"Hey, Drippy, you're back. What's for dinner?
"
,,
4,16,"Peter, when I said bond with Stewie, this is
"
,,
4,16,"not what I had in mind. I am furious with you.
"
,,
4,16,"You can't talk to him like that.
"
,,
4,16,"Take that.
"
,,
4,16," Stewie, you're going to your room.
"
,,
4,16," I think not. Dad's got my back.
"
,,
4,16,"She looks mad. You better go to your room.
"
,,
4,16,"What's the matter with you, fat man?
"
,,
4,16,"Stop her. Help me, you fool. You traitor.
"
,,
4,16,"I trusted you, but you're a wuss.
"
,,
4,16,"Don't feel bad, Peter.
"
,,
4,16,"Hey, I know what'll cheer you up.
"
,,
4,16," I don't think I'm in the mood.
"
,,
4,16," Are you sure?
"
,,
4,16,"Sorry, Brian. It's just not doing it today.
"
,,
4,16,"Stewie, got a minute for your daddy?
"
,,
4,16,"Get out of here, you spineless oaf. And by
"
,,
4,16,"the way, I faked all those bowel movements.
"
,,
4,16,"I feel awful. We were getting along and now
"
,,
4,16,"he hates me. How do I get him to like me?
"
,,
4,16,"That depends. Do you want my advice
"
,,
4,16,"or are you asking random questions again?
"
,,
4,16,"What's a hypotenuse?
"
,,
4,16,"I know you're mad, but when you see where
"
,,
4,16,"I'm taking you, you'll change your mind.
"
,,
4,16,"Yeah, right. I'm gonna change my mind.
"
,,
4,16,"We just sat on a plane for three hours
"
,,
4,16,"to come to Florida,
"
,,
4,16,"God's waiting room, for who knows what...
"
,,
4,16,"Disney World!
"
,,
4,16,"I want to go to Disney World! Disney World!
"
,,
4,16,"I'm still mad at you.
"
,,
4,16,"Check it out, Stewie. Halle Berry's Wild Ride.
"
,,
4,16,"Wow. It looks like Michael Jackson's
"
,,
4,16,"coming right at me.
"
,,
4,16,"We've been puttering around
"
,,
4,16,"this fat farm for hours. I've had enough.
"
,,
4,16,"Hey, Stewie, they got... Stewie?
"
,,
4,16,"Oh, my God, he's gone.
"
,,
4,16,"Has anyone seen my son? Hello?
"
,,
4,16,"Hey, you guys seen my son?</i>
"
,,
4,16,"Well, I done seen about everything,
"
,,
4,16,"but I sure enough ain't seen your boy, nohow.
"
,,
4,16,"That's good old-fashioned family racism.
"
,,
4,16,"Well, well. A lost child.
"
,,
4,16,"Looks like we've got a new recruit.
"
,,
4,16," Now sing.
"
,,
4,16," I shall do no such thing.
"
,,
4,16,"You must sing. If you don't, they'll make you
"
,,
4,16,"do a Christmas movie with Tim Allen.
"
,,
4,16,"Is Chris doing chores
"
,,
4,16,"for that disgusting man?
"
,,
4,16,"Meg, that's not nice. Old people have a lot
"
,,
4,16,"to offer society. Just look at Kim Cattrall.
"
,,
4,16,"Come and get it, big boy.
"
,,
4,16,"Damn.
"
,,
4,16,"There we go.
"
,,
4,16,"Thanks for buying dinner, Mr Herbert.
"
,,
4,16,"I wanted to thank you properly
"
,,
4,16,"for all your hard work.
"
,,
4,16," Souvenir photograph?
"
,,
4,16," Hell, yes.
"
,,
4,16,"Are you dead?
"
,,
4,16," I say, fat man, get me out of here.
"
,,
4,16," There you are.
"
,,
4,16,"Thank God. Why are you dressed like Rerun?
"
,,
4,16,"You're free. Run back
"
,,
4,16,"to your individual countries of origin.
"
,,
4,16,"Those multicultural slave children belong
"
,,
4,16,"to the Disney Corporation. Get 'em, Achmed.
"
,,
4,16,"Look over there. There's a woman learning.
"
,,
4,16,"Quick, in here.
"
,,
4,16,"Looks like we're in the clear.
"

4,16," Michael Eisner.

4,16,"Kali Ma.
"
,,
4,16,"You betrayed the shareholders.
"
,,
4,16," You think he's dead?
"
,,
4,16," Nah, he'll be on his feet in no time.
"
,,
4,16,"He'll follow Jonathan Dolgen's footsteps with
"
,,
4,16,"a POD deal at Touchstone. Are you all right?
"
,,
4,16,"Fat man, I'm not sure how to say this
"
,,
4,16,"without sounding cheesy,
"
,,
4,16,"but, well, you really
"
,,
4,16,"came through for me today,
"
,,
4,16,"so I...
"
,,
4,16," What the hell.
"
,,
4,16," I love you too, buddy.
"
,,
4,16,"Come on, Stewie. Let's go home.
"

4,17,"I can't do it. I'm so full.
"
,,
4,17,"Full of what? Oestrogen?
"
,,
4,17,"Come on, take the skirt off, you pansy.
"
,,
4,17," Let's go. Chow down, Mary Jane.
"
,,
4,17," I said I can't.
"
,,
4,17," Eat it. Eat the damn steak.
"
,,
4,17," No.
"
,,
4,17," What are you waiting for?
"
,,
4,17," I can't. No. No. No.
"
,,
4,17,"I said I'm not hungry!!
"
,,
4,17,"Where is it now, huh? Where is it now?!
"
,,
4,17,"Easy, sailor. Easy.
"
,,
4,17," Put the gun down, Joe.
"
,,
4,17," Nobody's judging you, man. It's cool.
"
,,
4,17,"I'll put this in your purse,
"
,,
4,17,"next to your tampons.
"
,,
4,17,"All right, let's start the bidding. Jennifer,
"
,,
4,17,"how much do you bid on the dinette set?
"
,,
4,17," 675, Bob.
"
,,
4,17," 675. Steven?
"
,,
4,17," 780.
"
,,
4,17," 780. Tammy?
"
,,
4,17," What was the last bid?
"
,,
4,17," 780.
"
,,
4,17,"Fuck you!
"
,,
4,17," Hi, honey. How was your physical?
"
,,
4,17," Good, good, good. Yeah, yeah.
"
,,
4,17,"Too good. You know what the doctor said?
"
,,
4,17,"The doctor said I was too healthy, you know?
"
,,
4,17,"In too good of shape. Don't even know how.
"
,,
4,17," You didn't go to your physical, did you?
"
,,
4,17," I did not.
"
,,
4,17,"So, Doctor? Is Peter healthy?
"
,,
4,17," My goodness, you'll be dead in a month.
"
,,
4,17," What?!
"
,,
4,17,"Hgar the Horrible,
"
,,
4,17,"if you keep up that lifestyle
"
,,
4,17,"of pillaging and turkey legs,
"
,,
4,17,"you'll be dead in a month.
"
,,
4,17," Now on to you.
"
,,
4,17," So what do you think? Pretty healthy?
"
,,
4,17,"Well, Mr Griffin, let's take a look
"
,,
4,17,"at your physical results.
"
,,
4,17,"There's a spider in here. Now, here we go.
"
,,
4,17,"Mr Griffin, you're going to expire in a month.
"
,,
4,17,"This is your driver's licence, isn't it?
"
,,
4,17,"I'm afraid you are going to die when you
"
,,
4,17,"watch these Dean Martin celebrity roasts.
"
,,
4,17,"Will you just tell us how Peter's health is?
"
,,
4,17,"Mr Griffin, I'm not quite sure how to say this.
"
,,
4,17,"Kim Bassinger.
"
,,
4,17," But now on to the cancer.
"
,,
4,17," My God.
"
,,
4,17,"You are a Cancer, right? You were born
"
,,
4,17,"in July? On to these test results.
"
,,
4,17,"My, they're much worse than I thought.
"
,,
4,17,"My son got a D minus on his history test.
"
,,
4,17," Now, that liver's got to come out.
"
,,
4,17," What?
"
,,
4,17,"It's been in the microwave
"
,,
4,17,"for three minutes. Now...
"
,,
4,17,"Please. Please,
"
,,
4,17,"we can't take any more shtick.
"
,,
4,17,"Please just tell us. Is Peter healthy?
"
,,
4,17," He's fine. He's just really fat.
"
,,
4,17," Thank God.
"
,,
4,17,"Wait, wait, wait. Hang on a second.
"
,,
4,17,"Did you just say I was fat?
"
,,
4,17,"Well, yeah. You are pretty fat.
"
,,
4,17,"OK. This is news to me.
"
,,
4,17,"This is more awkward than having sex
"
,,
4,17,"with a rhinoceros who doesn't love you.
"
,,
4,17,"Why wouldn't you look at me during?
"
,,
4,17," How was your physical?
"
,,
4,17," Doctor said I was fat. Can you believe that?
"
,,
4,17," You are on the large side.
"
,,
4,17," Please, Brian.
"
,,
4,17,"If I was fat, could I do this with a Hula Hoop?
"
,,
4,17,"No, no, no.
"
,,
4,17,"I guess you couldn't do that if you were fat.
"
,,
4,17,"Careful, Peter. That's an old family photo.
"
,,
4,17,"My mother gave it to me.
"
,,
4,17,"That's weird.
"
,,
4,17," I didn't know you had a brother.
"
,,
4,17," I don't. I mean, I don't think so.
"
,,
4,17,"Hey, if I'm fat, then Stewie's fat too
"
,,
4,17,"because we wear the same size Onesie.
"
,,
4,17," Hello, pumpkin.
"
,,
4,17," Hello, Daddy.
"
,,
4,17," Did I miss your piano recital?
"
,,
4,17," No, Daddy. I'm in my 40s now.
"
,,
4,17," Good God.
"
,,
4,17," I had a question I wanted to ask.
"
,,
4,17,"Do I have a brother?
"
,,
4,17," No. No. Don't be silly.
"
,,
4,17," Because I found this picture...
"
,,
4,17," Dick. Thank God you're here. Talk to her.

"
,,
4,17," Daddy will never tell me the truth.
"
,,
4,17,"The only way is to check the family records.

4,17,"I do have a brother.
"

4,17,"My God. I've got to meet him.
"
,,
4,17,"Hey, Brian. You know what'd be fun?
"
,,
4,17,"God, totally.
"
,,
4,17,"Awesome.
"
,,
4,17,"Sometimes the old-fashioned playthings
"
,,
4,17,"are the best.
"
,,
4,17,"Hey, kids of America.
"
,,
4,17,"It's hand-painted wooden ball in a cup.
"
,,
4,17,"Who needs constant electronic video
"
,,
4,17,"stimulation when there's ball in a cup?
"
,,
4,17,"Mexico's favourite toy for over 340 years.
"
,,
4,17,"Toss the ball, catch it in the cup,
"
,,
4,17,"dump it out of the cup, toss it,
"
,,
4,17,"and catch it in the cup again.
"
,,
4,17,"The ball is on a string and attached to the cup
"
,,
4,17,"so there's no worry if you don't catch the ball.
"
,,
4,17,"And cleanup is as easy
"
,,
4,17,"as catching a ball in a cup.
"
,,
4,17,"Why spend another day
"
,,
4,17,"not catching a ball in a cup
"
,,
4,17,"when you could be catching a ball in a cup?
"
,,
4,17,"Ball in a cup.
"
,,
4,17,"I think you're in denial about this fat thing.
"
,,
4,17,"Yeah? Well, I challenge you
"
,,
4,17,"to prove to me that I'm fat.
"
,,
4,17," OK, hang on. See this?
"
,,
4,17," Yeah.
"
,,
4,17," You know what it is?
"
,,
4,17," It's an apple.
"
,,
4,17,"Good, good, good. All right, watch this.
"
,,
4,17,"What the hell? What is this?
"
,,
4,17,"What is this? Some kind of gag?
"
,,
4,17,"No. That's orbit.
"
,,
4,17," You have your own gravitational pull.
"
,,
4,17," That's a bunch of crap.
"
,,
4,17,"brother? Maybe Dateline will do a story.</i>
"
,,
4,17,"I'll get to meet that ass Stone Phillips. He's
"
,,
4,17,"the kind of guy you hate till he's inside you.
"
,,
4,17,"There it is. 56 Meadow Lane.
"
,,
4,17,"Brookfield Insane Asylum?
"
,,
4,17,"My God. Mom's brother's crazy.
"
,,
4,17,"No. I didn't catch the ball in the cup.
"
,,
4,17,"Wait. It's OK because the ball
"
,,
4,17,"is on a string and attached to the cup.
"
,,
4,17,"Doctor, is my brother really insane?
"
,,
4,17,"Mrs Griffin, we don't use the word ""insane"".
"
,,
4,17,"We prefer the term ""mentally hilarious"".
"
,,
4,17,"I can't wait to meet the lunatic.
"
,,
4,17,"I bet he's weirder than that commercial I saw.
"
,,
4,17," Is that butter substitute?
"
,,
4,17," It sure is.
"
,,
4,17," Is it true it has half the calories of butter?
"
,,
4,17," Yep.
"
,,
4,17," Can I have some?
"
,,
4,17," Get your own.
"
,,
4,17," Take that, you bitch.
"
,,
4,17," What the hell?
"
,,
4,17," How'd you like that?
"
,,
4,17," Joke's on you. I have hepatitis.
"
,,
4,17," Patrick?
"
,,
4,17," Yes.
"
,,
4,17,"My name's Lois. I'm your sister.
"
,,
4,17,"My God, Lois.
"
,,
4,17," I never thought I'd see you again.
"
,,
4,17," These are my children.
"
,,
4,17,"Why do you live in a crazy house,
"
,,
4,17,"Uncle Patrick?
"
,,
4,17,"Well, when I was just a little boy,
"
,,
4,17,"I had a very traumatic experience.
"
,,
4,17,"Mommy, can I have a drink of water?
"
,,
4,17,"Jackie Gleason?
"
,,
4,17,"Beat it, kid. Your mother's busy.
"
,,
4,17,"Right in the kisser.
"
,,
4,17," That's a horrible story.
"
,,
4,17," Yes.
"
,,
4,17,"I was so traumatised they sent me here.
"
,,
4,17,"I guess they must have forgotten about me.
"
,,
4,17,"Well, you seem perfectly normal to me.
"
,,
4,17,"No brother of mine is gonna be
"
,,
4,17,"cooped up in some insane asylum.
"
,,
4,17,"We are taking you back to Quahog with us.
"
,,
4,17,"That's a great idea. He can bring his sling
"
,,
4,17,"blade and order some French-fried potatoes.
"
,,
4,17,"Thank God I'm out of hospital.
"
,,
4,17,"It's great to eat with my family
"
,,
4,17,"instead of a bunch of chronic masturbators.
"
,,
4,17," Those people are disgusting.
"
,,
4,17," Is it lonely up there on your pedestal?
"
,,
4,17,"Peter, there you are.
"
,,
4,17,"This is my brother, Patrick.
"
,,
4,17,"Good to meet you. Listen up, everybody.
"
,,
4,17,"I have something to tell you.
"
,,
4,17,"I'm not quite sure how to say this.
"
,,
4,17,"I'm fat. Let me give you
"
,,
4,17,"a minute to absorb that.
"
,,
4,17,"That's the way it is. It's nobody's fault. Meg.
"
,,
4,17,"But I've decided to do something about it.
"
,,
4,17," You gonna drop some weight, fat-ass?
"
,,
4,17," No, dummy.
"
,,
4,17,"I'm gonna help make this a fat man's world
"
,,
4,17,"by establishing the National Association
"
,,
4,17,"for the Advancement of Fat People.
"
,,
4,17,"This is the best idea I've had
"
,,
4,17,"since I slayed that dragon.
"
,,
4,17," Cybill Shepherd?
"
,,
4,17," Yes.
"
,,
4,17,"People, you are free.
"
,,
4,17,"I'm very glad you're here, Patrick.
"
,,
4,17,"Well, I want to tell you that Marian and I
"
,,
4,17,"both appreciate what you've done.
"
,,
4,17,"Marian? You have a girlfriend.
"
,,
4,17,"Where are my manners? Marian is my wife.
"
,,
4,17,"She's sitting right next to me.
"
,,
4,17,"Here we go.
"
,,
4,17,"Nice to meet you, Marian.
"
,,
4,17,"What's that, honey? Yes.
"
,,
4,17,"Hang on. Marian wants some coffee.
"
,,
4,17,"Lois, did you see that? He's nuts.
"
,,
4,17,"Brian, he's been locked up
"
,,
4,17,"in that place for 30 years.
"
,,
4,17,"It's perfectly understandable
"
,,
4,17,"that he'd invent an imaginary companion.
"
,,
4,17,"He's more imaginative
"
,,
4,17,"than the people who invented singing.
"
,,
4,17,"All right, everyone, I'd like to get started.
"
,,
4,17,"I'd like to get...
"
,,
4,17,"We're start... You know what?
"
,,
4,17,"Maybe everyone should sit down.
"
,,
4,17,"OK, that's better.
"
,,
4,17,"Welcome, everybody, to the...
"
,,
4,17,"Snacks are best saved for later.
"
,,
4,17,"I've prepared an agenda
"
,,
4,17,"for our organisation,
"
,,
4,17,"what we want from the community
"
,,
4,17,"as fat people with pride.
"
,,
4,17,"We got a lot accomplished here today.
"
,,
4,17,"We'll pick this up again tomorrow.
"
,,
4,17,"Hey, guys. I'm going for a run. Do me a favour
"
,,
4,17,"and keep Marian company while I'm gone.
"
,,
4,17," Sure.
"
,,
4,17," Great. Bye, honey.
"
,,
4,17,"Hey, Brian.
"
,,
4,17,"Marian just called you an alcoholic.
"
,,
4,17,"Yeah? Marian just called you a homo.
"
,,
4,17,"Wait a second. I'll be right back.
"
,,
4,17,"Hey, Brian, Brian.
"
,,
4,17,"What if I put this cucumber right here?
"
,,
4,17,"Put it right there.
"
,,
4,17,"Do you think Patrick would be angry?
"
,,
4,17,"I don't know, man. It's his wife.
"
,,
4,17,"You don't think he'd be ticked off
"
,,
4,17,"if I put that right there?
"
,,
4,17,"Just right in that spot there on the couch?
"
,,
4,17," Hey, Marian's giving you a thumbs up.
"
,,
4,17," You know what we should do?
"
,,
4,17,"We should let it sit here
"
,,
4,17,"for a couple of weeks and see if it pickles.
"
,,
4,17,"If after three weeks it pickles, then she's real
"
,,
4,17,"and we both have to buy Patrick a steak.
"
,,
4,17,"Hey, pie. I know what you want.
"
,,
4,17,"I saw you in that movie. Whore, slut, bitch.
"
,,
4,17,"You don't deserve to have sex with me.
"
,,
4,17,"I'm gonna eat the whore out of you.
"
,,
4,17," Peter, did you start a coalition for fat guys?
"
,,
4,17," Yeah. The fat-guy coalition.
"
,,
4,17,"Peter, you shouldn't encourage people
"
,,
4,17,"to be fat. Fat people are immoral.
"
,,
4,17," How do you figure, sports fan?
"
,,
4,17," They're just bad, like that Jackie Gleason.
"
,,
4,17,"He was fat and he was bad.
"
,,
4,17,"One time when I was a boy...
"
,,
4,17,"I love Jackie Gleason. Hey, take a look
"
,,
4,17,"at what I bought at this TV convention.
"
,,
4,17,"It's a bus driver's uniform.
"
,,
4,17,"Right in the kisser.
"
,,
4,17,"Right in the kisser.
"
,,
4,17,"Right in the kisser.
"
,,
4,17,"Right in the kisser.
"
,,
4,17,"Right in the kisser.
"
,,
4,17,"Right in the kisser.
"
,,
4,17,"Right in the kisser.
"
,,
4,17,"Right in the kisser.
"
,,
4,17,"Right in the kisser.
"
,,
4,17,"Right in the kisser.
"
,,
4,17,"That set him off like a Paul Shaffer fire alarm.
"
,,
4,17," Hello.
"
,,
4,17," Lois, it's your father.
"
,,
4,17,"The hospital said you released Patrick.
"
,,
4,17,"Have you lost your mind? He's dangerous.
"
,,
4,17,"Well, that's ridiculous.
"
,,
4,17,"Patrick is a very nice man.
"
,,
4,17,"And you should be ashamed of yourself
"
,,
4,17,"for locking up your own son.
"
,,
4,17,"Whose pickle is this?
"
,,
4,17,"This just in. The body of a local fat man was
"
,,
4,17,"found murdered in Quahog Park last night.
"
,,
4,17,"Police released this sketch of the suspect.
"
,,
4,17,"My God.
"
,,
4,17,"Police also released this sketch of
"
,,
4,17,"a female accomplice believed to be his wife.
"
,,
4,17,"Hello, I'm Tom Tucker. Quahog's
"
,,
4,17,"newest serial killer has struck again.
"
,,
4,17,"Since the first victim at Quahog Park,
"
,,
4,17,"three more men have been killed,
"
,,
4,17,"all of them very very fat.
"
,,
4,17," Lois, that sketch looks a lot like Patrick.
"
,,
4,17," That's ridiculous.
"
,,
4,17,"He's clearly crazy.
"
,,
4,17,"Look at that imaginary wife of his.
"
,,
4,17,"If she's imaginary,
"
,,
4,17,"how do you explain the pickle on the couch?
"
,,
4,17,"I don't understand what...
"
,,
4,17,"Wait. Really?
"
,,
4,17," Hey, Stewie.
"
,,
4,17," I know, I know. I heard.
"
,,
4,17,"Patrick. Where have you been?
"
,,
4,17,"It's nothing you need to
"
,,
4,17,"concern yourself with, Lois.
"
,,
4,17," Well, that's a relief.
"
,,
4,17," Yeah, that's a relief.
"
,,
4,17,"The fat-guy strangler lives here
"
,,
4,17,"and there's a fat guy in the house.
"
,,
4,17,"This'll be worse
"
,,
4,17,"than when Peter did Tara Reid's boob job.
"
,,
4,17,"Dropped some pepperoni on there.
"
,,
4,17,"You know what? That works. Sew it up.
"
,,
4,17,"Michael was one of our brothers.
"
,,
4,17,"He was a good man.
"
,,
4,17,"He was a kind man. He was a fat man.
"
,,
4,17,"And now he's a dead man. And we're all next.
"
,,
4,17,"The fat-guy strangler's gonna get us.
"
,,
4,17," He's right.
"
,,
4,17," Can someone tie my shoe?
"
,,
4,17,"People, people. I know what'll make us
"
,,
4,17,"feel better. Let us sing the NAAFP anthem.
"
,,
4,17,"Make yourselves at home.
"
,,
4,17,"Lois, these are the fat guys. Fat guys, Lois.
"
,,
4,17,"My God, look at you fat bastards. I bet
"
,,
4,17,"none of you can even find your own penis.
"
,,
4,17,"Find your penis for a dollar. Find your penis,
"
,,
4,17,"one dollar. One dollar, find your penis.
"
,,
4,17," Peter, what's going on?
"
,,
4,17," Lois, my people are in danger.
"
,,
4,17,"Until they find the fat-guy strangler, we will
"
,,
4,17,"stay here. Victor, don't lean against that.
"
,,
4,17," Hey, everybody.
"
,,
4,17," Get these guys out. Patrick is the murderer.
"
,,
4,17," What?
"
,,
4,17," You son of a bitch.

4,17,"Out of my way. Your brother is toast.
"

4,17,"Warm, buttery toast.
"

4,17," That sounds good.
"
,,
4,17," I just found my penis.
"

4,17," Run, Patrick, run.
"
,,
4,17," After him.
"
,,
4,17,"Boys, to your Rascals.
"
,,
4,17," He went into James Woods. Let's find him.
"

4,17," We'll head him off at the...
"

4,17,"Todd, you gotta chew your food.
"
,,
4,17,"I know my brother.
"

4,17,"He couldn't have done these things.
"

4,17,"Well, let's see if you feel that way
"
,,
4,17,"when you see this.
"
,,
4,17,"Look.
"
,,
4,17,"So he has pictures of himself
"
,,
4,17,"strangling fat guys.
"
,,
4,17," That doesn't mean he's the fat-guy strangler.
"
,,
4,17," What about the dead fat guy under his bed?
"
,,
4,17," Coincidence?
"
,,
4,17," What about the half-dead fat guy?
"
,,
4,17," Patrick tried to kill me.
"
,,
4,17," It's a different Patrick.
"
,,
4,17," Lois.
"
,,
4,17," OK, OK.
"
,,
4,17," My God. Peter's out there with him.
"
,,
4,17," Wait. You gonna eat that dead fat guy?
"
,,
4,17," How are we gonna find them?
"
,,
4,17," I'm good at finding people.
"
,,
4,17,"I found Bush after Hurricane Katrina.
"
,,
4,17," Mr President, are you up there?
"
,,
4,17," Go away.
"
,,
4,17," I'm reading Superfudge.</i>
"
,,
4,17," You gotta deal with this.
"
,,
4,17," Don't make me do stuff.
"
,,
4,17,"Patrick. Patrick.
"
,,
4,17,"Crap. We lost him. Nothing left to do
"
,,
4,17,"but finish this sentence uninterrup...
"
,,
4,17," Patrick, let him go.
"
,,
4,17," Don't come any closer.
"
,,
4,17,"Patrick, let him go,
"
,,
4,17,"or Marian gets it.
"
,,
4,17,"Nice try, but Marian's over there.
"
,,
4,17,"Don't hurt her.
"
,,
4,17," Now let him go.
"
,,
4,17," OK. OK.
"
,,
4,17," You missed.
"
,,
4,17," No, I didn't.
"
,,
4,17,"That's for rolling up the window
"
,,
4,17,"when I tried to jump into the General Lee.
"
,,
4,17,"I'm sorry, Lois.
"
,,
4,17,"I never meant to hurt anybody.
"
,,
4,17,"I did mean to kill those fat guys,
"
,,
4,17,"but I never meant to hurt you.
"
,,
4,17,"You may be very sick, Patrick,
"
,,
4,17,"but I love you.
"
,,
4,17,"You're my brother
"
,,
4,17,"and you'll always be my brother.
"
,,
4,17," I have to go back to the hospital, don't I?
"
,,
4,17," Yeah. I'm afraid so.
"
,,
4,17,"Patrick, did you see how that rock hit me
"
,,
4,17,"in the face? It was like, right in the kisser.
"
,,
4,17,"Right in the kisser.
"
,,
4,17,"Stop screaming. You can't hear me.
"
,,
4,17,"Right in the kisser. Right in the kisser.
"
,,
4,17," I miss Uncle Patrick.
"
,,
4,17," Don't worry.
"
,,
4,17," I promise we can visit him once a month.
"
,,
4,17," We'll be his period.
"
,,
4,17,"I was just upstairs and there's
"
,,
4,17,"a half-dead fat guy eating a dead fat guy.

4,18,"No, actually, get me, like, a Dewar's and soda.

4,18," We're surrounded by saltwater. It's difficult.

4,18," I know. I'm just saying... I'm just saying try.

"

4,18,"His folksy racism,

4,18,"his ""I don't care where I am"" flatulence.

4,18,"even when there's no food.
"
,,
4,18," Hiya, Dad.
"
,,
4,18," Francis, it's so good to see you.
"
,,
4,18,"Lois, you haven't changed a bit,
"

4,18,"you lying bitch.
"
,,
4,18,"Why don't you come into the dining room?
"
,,
4,18,"The table's all set for your birthday dinner.
"
,,
4,18,"Lois, actually, Dad said he would prefer it
"
,,
4,18,"if you did notjoin us.
"
,,
4,18,"You know, you being a Protestant and all.
"
,,
4,18," He said it's OK if you sit at the kids' table.
"
,,
4,18," I cooked the damn dinner.
"
,,
4,18,"I knew you were gonna react like this.
"
,,
4,18,"That's why I brought Bill Lumbergh
"
,,
4,18,"to explain it.
"
,,
4,18,"Yeah, I'm gonna need you to go ahead
"
,,
4,18,"and not complain about this.
"
,,
4,18,"And if you could go ahead
"
,,
4,18,"and sit at the kids' table, that'd be great.
"
,,
4,18,"I'm just saying, '70s boobs were different.
"

4,18,"I don't know.
"
,,
4,18,"It won't kill you
"
,,
4,18,"to contribute to the conversation.
"
,,
4,18,"Dad, tell us about World War I and how
"
,,
4,18,"America defeated Kaiser Permanente.
"
,,
4,18,"Lois, when are you
"
,,
4,18,"gonna get that baby baptised?
"
,,
4,18,"Oh, God. Not this again. Francis,
"
,,
4,18,"why the hell is this always an issue with you?
"
,,
4,18,"Because I love this family
"
,,
4,18,"and I don't want my grandson to burn in hell.
"
,,
4,18,"I love you, Grandpa. Your toenails
"
,,
4,18,"are the same colour as my school bus.
"
,,
4,18,"You really think splashing magic water
"
,,
4,18,"on Stewie will keep him out of hell?
"

4,18," Peter, we have a problem.
"
,,
4,18," Hang on, Lois. I'm watching a movie.
"
,,
4,18," You think we should be this far out?
"
,,
4,18," Stop worrying, Mark. We'll be fine.
"
,,
4,18,"Hey, I'm gonna eat y'all.
"
,,
4,18,"I'm gonna eat that hairy leg.
"
,,
4,18,"I'm gonna eat that one too.
"
,,
4,18,"I can see right up them shorts.
"
,,
4,18,"I got a whole bunch of rows of teeth
"
,,
4,18,"to chew you with.
"
,,
4,18,"Now, wait a minute.
"
,,
4,18,"I did have a chubby kid on a raft earlier today.
"
,,
4,18,"It's OK, though.
"
,,
4,18,"I've been swimming a lot lately.
"
,,
4,18,"Yummy.
"
,,
4,18,"Your father won't let up
"
,,
4,18,"about Stewie getting baptised.
"
,,
4,18,"I am sick of him always trying to force
"
,,
4,18,"his religious views on us.
"
,,
4,18,"I'll talk to him, Lois, but when my dad wants
"
,,
4,18,"something, it's like sex with Kobe Bryant.
"
,,
4,18,"You can kick and scream all you want,
"
,,
4,18,"but it's gonna happen.
"
,,
4,18," Dad, what are you doing?
"
,,
4,18," There's no cross! Every kitchen needs one.
"
,,
4,18,"Nothing says ""eat up"" like a bleeding
"
,,
4,18,"half-naked Jew nailed to a piece of wood.
"
,,
4,18,"Listen, Dad, I gotta talk to you.
"
,,
4,18,"Lois was wondering if maybe you could...
"
,,
4,18,"I don't know, ease up on the whole
"
,,
4,18,"Jesus-ay Christ-ay, if you catch my drift?
"
,,
4,18,"You're a lapsed Catholic, Peter.
"
,,
4,18,"Your wife's a Protestant whore
"
,,
4,18,"and your baby isn't even baptised!
"
,,
4,18,"All right, Dad. I don't want you to hate me,
"
,,
4,18,"so I'll make a deal with you.
"
,,
4,18,"If we get Stewie baptised,
"
,,
4,18,"you and all other old people
"
,,
4,18,"have to acknowledge and be aware
"
,,
4,18,"there's crap in the corners of your mouth.
"
,,
4,18,"I'll think about it. Now let's go!
"
,,
4,18,"they try to be on Desperate Housewives.</i>
"
,,
4,18,"Go ahead, switch over to ABC
"
,,
4,18,"for five seconds. I'll wait five seconds.
"
,,
4,18,"Oh, my God. Did you see?
"
,,
4,18,"Did you see how old and ugly they are?
"
,,
4,18,"Oh, my God, that redhead looks like
"
,,
4,18,"somebody poured Silly Putty over their knee.
"
,,
4,18,"I'm sorry, Mr Griffin,
"
,,
4,18,"but I can't baptise little Stewie today.
"
,,
4,18,"Our last shipment of holy water is tainted.
"
,,
4,18,"Tainted? Holy water? How did that happen?
"
,,
4,18,"We'll call you when we get a new shipment in.
"
,,
4,18,"There's no such thing as tainted holy water.
"
,,
4,18,"Come on! We'll do it ourselves.
"
,,
4,18,"Stewie Griffin, I baptise you in the name
"
,,
4,18,"of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.
"
,,
4,18," What are you doing?</i>
"
,,
4,18,"Oh, my God. This is almost as bad
"
,,
4,18,"as my bath with Kathy Bates.
"
,,
4,18,"Yeah, I think I'm going to get out.
"
,,
4,18,"Stewie, you don't look so good.
"
,,
4,18,"Baby, you're burning up.
"
,,
4,18,"Oh, my God. Stewie! Stewie! Speak to me.
"
,,
4,18,"Don't... don't take me to a black doctor.
"
,,
4,18,"Mr and Mrs Griffin, I've examined your son
"
,,
4,18,"and he is suffering from toxic anaemia,
"
,,
4,18,"which has weakened his immune system.
"
,,
4,18," Is he gonna die?
"
,,
4,18," No, but he's vulnerable to infection.
"
,,
4,18,"He must be
"
,,
4,18,"in a germ-free plastic environment.
"
,,
4,18,"My God, you mean
"
,,
4,18,"like John Travolta in that movie?
"
,,
4,18,"like in Face/Off?</i>
"
,,
4,18,"It looks like the operation was a success.
"
,,
4,18,"Do you know what the best part of this is?
"
,,
4,18,"Try licking yourself.
"
,,
4,18,"You bastard.
"
,,
4,18,"How could this have happened?</i>
"
,,
4,18,"Stewie's been exposed to tainted holy water.
"
,,
4,18,"Peter, you had Stewie baptised
"
,,
4,18,"behind my back?
"
,,
4,18,"This is no worse than when I rented out
"
,,
4,18,"your uterus to those inner-city immigrants.
"
,,
4,18,"Peter, you're a complete slave
"
,,
4,18,"to your father's religion.
"
,,
4,18,"What about your religious beliefs?
"
,,
4,18," You have a choice, you know.
"
,,
4,18," I do?
"
,,
4,18,"Of course. You're a grown man.
"
,,
4,18,"You can pick any religion you want.
"
,,
4,18,"Really? You know, Lois, maybe you're right.
"
,,
4,18,"Maybe I should pick my own religion.
"
,,
4,18,"The question is, which one?
"
,,
4,18,"I tell you what you can pick -
"
,,
4,18,"a tune on the piano.
"
,,
4,18,"How the whiz-bang does the rest of it go?
"
,,
4,18,"Quick, make something up.
"
,,
4,18,"What are all these women
"
,,
4,18,"doing in our living room?
"
,,
4,18,"I took your advice and picked a new religion.
"
,,
4,18," I'm gonna be a Mormon.
"
,,
4,18," A Mormon? Are you sure?
"
,,
4,18,"Nailing a different wife every night?
"
,,
4,18,"It's a no-brainer.
"
,,
4,18,"Lois, this is Kimmy,
"
,,
4,18,"the checkout girl from the Korean market.
"
,,
4,18,"Nancy, our postal carrier.
"
,,
4,18,"And Tiffany, the woman
"
,,
4,18,"who stands downtown and screams at traffic.
"
,,
4,18,"I ate a tube of Crest for dinner!
"
,,
4,18,"Isn't she funny? She's definitely
"
,,
4,18,"the Kramer of my Mormon wives.
"
,,
4,18," Nancy, get me a beer.
"
,,
4,18," Mormons aren't allowed to drink alcohol.
"
,,
4,18," Did you just throw those women away?
"
,,
4,18," No. Maybe.

"
,,
4,18,"Hi. My name's Peter. I'm a Jehovah's Witness,
"
,,
4,18,"here to spread the good news
"
,,
4,18,"of the story of Jesus.
"
,,
4,18,"OK. Go ahead.
"
,,
4,18,"Really? Wow! Boy!
"
,,
4,18,"You're the first person
"
,,
4,18,"who didn't slam the door on me.
"
,,
4,18,"OK, well, Jesus was
"
,,
4,18,"a miracle worker of sorts.
"
,,
4,18,"He would travel from place to place
"
,,
4,18,"putting things right that once went wrong
"
,,
4,18,"and hoping each time that his next leap
"
,,
4,18,"would be the leap home.

"
,,
4,18,"I thought that dot on your head
"

4,18,"was from a sniper rifle.
"
,,
4,18,"Peter, this spot is a sacred adornment.

4,18,"It's a portal, an opening,

,,
4,18,"through which all light, rejuvenation,
"
,,
4,18,"joy and ecstasy may enter the human form.
"
,,
4,18," A vagina?
"
,,
4,18," Get out!
"
,,
4,18,"Time for The View.</i>
"
,,
4,18,"No, no! Not again!
"
,,
4,18,"Let me out of here!
"
,,
4,18,"I can't watch another second!
"
,,
4,18,"Relax, Stewie. The doctor gave me this
"
,,
4,18,"so you can get some exercise.
"
,,
4,18,"Boy! Stewie's more wound up
"
,,
4,18,"than Dad was that time he took steroids.
"
,,
4,18,"Peter, could you please pass the potatoes?
"
,,
4,18,"Dammit, Meg!

4,18," That Fonzie is magic.</i>
"
,,
4,18,"I love how he hits the jukebox

"
,,
4,18," What is it, Mr C?
"
,,
4,18," Fonz, I...
"
,,
4,18,"I wanted to pleasure Marion
"
,,

"

,,
4,18,"All right. Come here.
"

"
,,
4,18," Just do this for me!
"

4,18,"Peter, where have you been, lad?
"
,,
4,18,"Dad, I was trying to find my own religion,
"

4,18,"but it didn't work out.
"
,,
4,18,"I haven't been this disappointed

4,18,"since I lost my virginity.

4,18,"offering wisdom and truth?
"

4,18,"There is only one person!
"
,,
4,18,"And it's time for him
"
,,
4,18,"to be properly worshipped.
"
,,
4,18,"I, Peter Griffin, hereby establish
"
,,
4,18,"the First United Church of the Fonz!
"
,,
4,18,"Fonzie, if this be your will, give me a sign.
"
,,
4,18,"Hi, I'm Lindsay Lohan.
"
,,
4,18,"This is how a crab walks.
"
,,
4,18,"It sure is! Fonzie be praised!
"
,,
4,18,"All right, Dad!
"
,,
4,18,"Two days ago this was an old barn.
"
,,
4,18,"And now, thanks to you,
"
,,
4,18,"it's an old barn with a sign on it.
"
,,
4,18,"All things are possible
"
,,
4,18,"through the Lord God Arthur Fonzarelli.
"
,,
4,18," You're going through with this?
"
,,
4,18," Absolutely.
"
,,
4,18,"You know this place only cost me 100 bucks?
"
,,
4,18,"That's a better deal
"
,,
4,18,"than that Aaron Neville megaphone.
"
,,
4,18,"I want to thank you guys
"
,,
4,18,"for making me activity director for the day.
"
,,
4,18,"OK, first of all, can everybody...
"
,,
4,18,"What the hell?
"
,,
4,18,"What the hell's wrong with this thing?
"
,,
4,18,"OK. We're about to start the sack race.
"
,,
4,18,"Peter, it's not a good idea
"
,,
4,18,"to be putting these flyers all over town.
"
,,
4,18," People will think you're crazy.
"
,,
4,18," You like to lose a bunch of teeth?
"
,,
4,18,"I'm sorry.
"
,,
4,18,"That was more than what was called for.
"
,,
4,18,"But it happens
"
,,
4,18,"when you challenge someone's faith.
"
,,
4,18,"Peter, I know this is important to you.
"
,,
4,18,"But I don't want to see you humiliated.
"
,,
4,18,"I don't think anyone's
"
,,
4,18,"gonna want to worship the Fonz.
"
,,
4,18," Is this the church of the Fonz?
"
,,
4,18," Yes, it is.
"
,,
4,18,"I read your flyer!
"
,,
4,18,"Finally a religion that makes sense!
"
,,
4,18,"Hey, everyone! I found him. Over here!
"
,,
4,18,"There you are.
"
,,
4,18,"You would not believe the morning I've had.
"
,,
4,18,"What is this?
"
,,
4,18,"I thought you said we were going to church!
"
,,
4,18,"This is church. A new church, created by
"
,,
4,18,"a man brave enough to follow his own vision.
"
,,
4,18,"Please rise.
"
,,
4,18,"Now sit on it.
"
,,
4,18," The Fonz be with you.
"
,,
4,18," And also with you.
"
,,
4,18," Let us ""hey"".
"
,,
4,18," Hey.
"
,,
4,18,"I can't believe people are buying this.
"
,,
4,18,"Fonzie's cool, Brian. Deep down, I think
"
,,
4,18,"we all secretly yearn to be Italian and stupid.
"
,,
4,18,"A reading from the letters of Potsie
"
,,
4,18,"to the Tuscaderos.
"
,,
4,18,"""Yea, and did Fonzie downstairs cometh
"
,,
4,18,"from his apartment above the garage
"
,,
4,18,"and sayeth he, 'Reassembleth will I
"
,,
4,18,"the pieces of my motorcycle
"
,,
4,18,"though I suffereth
"
,,
4,18,"from temporary blindness. ""'

4,18,"""'And, yea, for I am holy, befriendeth I will

"
,,
4,18," Amen.
"
,,
4,18," Amen.
"
,,
4,18," What's that smell?
"
,,
4,18," Black spray paint.
"
,,
4,18," What were you painting?
"
,,
4,18," You think you're so funny.
"
,,
4,18,"Well, as soon as I figure out where I am,
"
,,
4,18,"you're dead, Brian!
"
,,
4,18,"Dammit. I haven't been this dizzy since I did
"
,,
4,18,"those helium whippets at that birthday party.
"
,,
4,18,"OK, OK, ready? Here goes.
"
,,
4,18,"I am a female. I have a high voice.
"
,,
4,18,"I have reproductive organs inside of me
"
,,
4,18,"and I buy groceries.
"
,,
4,18,"Peter, your religion is an abomination!
"
,,
4,18,"I never thought you could ever embarrass me
"
,,
4,18,"more than you did at Cousin Mary's wedding.
"
,,
4,18,"If anyone knows of any reason why these two
"
,,
4,18,"should not be married, let him speak now.
"
,,
4,18,"Really? Nobody's gonna speak up?
"
,,
4,18,"I'm the one who's gonna have to say it?
"
,,
4,18,"All right.
"
,,
4,18,"Genital warts!
"
,,
4,18,"But you said I should look into my heart
"
,,
4,18,"to find my religion.
"
,,
4,18,"Yes! Real religion!
"
,,
4,18,"What I saw today wasn't religion.
"
,,
4,18,"It was just a bunch of sheep singing songs
"
,,
4,18,"and listening to ridiculous tall tales!
"
,,
4,18," Actually, that is religion.
"
,,
4,18," Shut your trap!
"
,,
4,18," Ha! You tell him!
"
,,
4,18," Why? I agree with you.
"
,,
4,18,"Peter's found another way to exploit
"
,,
4,18,"people's ignorance and that's wrong.
"
,,
4,18,"You think I'm wr...?
"
,,
4,18,"See, Brian? That's a word the Fonz can't say.
"
,,
4,18,"Because all is right when you welcome
"
,,
4,18,"Fonzie into your life. Fonzie be with you.
"
,,
4,18,"I ought to take off my belt
"
,,
4,18,"and slap the crap out of him!
"
,,
4,18,"Look, I don't like you and you don't like me.
"
,,
4,18,"I suggest we set aside our differences
"
,,
4,18,"and work together.
"
,,
4,18," I have an idea to snap Peter out of this.
"
,,
4,18," Work together? You and me?
"
,,
4,18,"Sure. Sometimes opposites
"
,,
4,18,"work well together. Peter taught me that.
"
,,
4,18,"Reverend, I gotta talk to you. Last night
"
,,
4,18,"I had sex with a teenage blonde and her mom.
"
,,
4,18,"That's quite a story, but there's no confession
"
,,
4,18,"so there's really no reason for you to tell me.
"
,,
4,18,"Are you kidding? I'm telling everybody!
"
,,
4,18,"Let us pause to reflect on the sacred mystery
"
,,
4,18,"of Richie's elder brother Chuck,
"
,,
4,18,"who ascended the stairs with his basketball
"
,,
4,18,"in season one and never came down again.
"
,,
4,18,"There's one problem. When a religion gets
"
,,
4,18,"too powerful, it's bound to have imitators.
"
,,
4,18," What are you talking about?
"
,,
4,18," Hi. I'm Sherman Hemsley.
"
,,
4,18,"I've just established the Church of George
"
,,
4,18,"Jefferson. Who wants to move on up?
"
,,
4,18,"Hi, I'm Gavin MacLeod and I established
"
,,
4,18,"the Church of Captain Stubing.
"
,,
4,18,"Who wants to come on board?
"
,,
4,18,"Hi, I'm Kirk Cameron!
"
,,
4,18,"You here to convert people
"
,,
4,18,"to the Church of Mike Seaver?
"
,,
4,18,"No. I'm here to convert people to Christianity.
"
,,
4,18,"I can't believe it. Everybody's gone!
"
,,
4,18,"People are always looking for the next voice
"
,,
4,18,"to tell them what to do.
"
,,
4,18,"And here I was thinking
"
,,
4,18,"I was making a difference.
"
,,
4,18,"I thought I was connecting with people.
"
,,
4,18,"Could there be anyone stupider than me?
"
,,
4,18," Madonna?
"
,,
4,18," Yeah. She's pretty stupid.
"
,,
4,18," That's something we can agree on.
"
,,
4,18," Absolutely. Francis?
"
,,
4,18,"Oh, major idiot. Major idiot.
"
,,
4,18,"Yeah. Gosh! I guess we do have
"
,,
4,18,"some common ground here after all, huh?
"
,,
4,18,"Yeah. And ""La Isla Bonita"" - not a real place.
"
,,
4,18,"I looked it up, bought a globe, couldn't find it.
"
,,
4,18," That makes her a liar too.
"
,,
4,18," She's awful!
"
,,
4,18," Awful, awful woman.
"
,,
4,18," I agree, yeah.
"
,,
4,18," And she's a whore.
"
,,
4,18," Yeah, big time.
"
,,
4,18,"Oh, everybody. Canseco? Eww.
"
,,
4,18," Dennis Rodman.
"
,,
4,18," Dennis Rodman. Yeah.
"
,,
4,18," Rodman? My God!
"
,,
4,18," I think he lost all his money, didn't he?
"
,,
4,18,"Rodman? Are you sure
"
,,
4,18,"you're not thinking MC Hammer?
"
,,
4,18,"I think it was in, like, Stuff or so...</i>
"
,,
4,18,"It was on Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel.</i>
"
,,
4,18,"And they said
"
,,
4,18,"that he's in the poorhouse now.
"
,,
4,18," You think she'd do him now?
"
,,
4,18," Would Madonna do Rodman now?
"
,,
4,18,"Yeah. Cos it's not the money,
"
,,
4,18,"it's about pissing off Daddy.
"
,,
4,18," She's got a lot of problems.
"
,,
4,18," Lot of problems.
"
,,
4,18,"Yeah, we are smarter.
"
,,
4,18,"We are smarter than Madonna.
"
,,
4,18,"No question.
"
,,
4,18,"Well, I should probably
"
,,
4,18,"get out of these robes.
"
,,
4,18," Look at you. You're all better.
"
,,
4,18," That's right, Brian. And you are toast!
"
,,
4,18,"I'm gonna get in the gym, get my lats back,
"
,,
4,18,"and then me and my friends from Cobra Kai
"
,,
4,18,"are gonna take you down, man!
"
,,
4,18,"Listen. Sorry I had to
"
,,
4,18,"rain on your parade, Peter.
"
,,
4,18,"It's all right, Brian. I guess
"
,,
4,18,"the Church of the Fonz was just a bad idea.
"
,,
4,18,"Not really, Peter. You were preaching
"
,,
4,18,"honesty, friendship, courage.
"
,,
4,18,"If you managed to inspire even one person
"
,,
4,18,"to embrace those values, you were a success.
"
,,
4,18,"Thanks, Lois.
"
,,
4,18,"But I doubt there's any chance of that.

4,19," You need to get out of the house.

4,19,"That you don't have that blue vein up there

4,19,"that some of the bigger ones get.
"
,,
4,19,"What? I said you don't have that.
"
,,
4,19," Hey, buddy. You're not looking so good.
"
,,
4,19," Who cares how I look? Nothing matters.
"
,,
4,19,"We could all die tomorrow, every one of us.
"
,,
4,19,"Isn't that a damn good reason
"
,,
4,19,"to live it up today?
"
,,
4,19,"Come on. It can't be that simple.
"
,,
4,19,"Excuse me. I got a thing to do.
"
,,
4,19,"All right,
"
,,
4,19,"we have a very special guest tonight.
"
,,
4,19,"Please welcome the member of the board,
"
,,
4,19,"Frank Sinatra Jr.
"
,,
4,19,"All this singing is contagious. I'll sing too.
"
,,
4,19,"Adam West...
"
,,
4,19,"A little bit softer now.
"
,,
4,19,"I'll come out when they're all gone.
"
,,
4,19,"Wow, you actually got to sing
"
,,
4,19,"with Frank Sinatra Jr?
"
,,
4,19,"It was amazing. I got to tell you, he said some
"
,,
4,19,"things that were exactly what I needed to hear
"
,,
4,19,"and I was just inspired to get up on that
"
,,
4,19,"stage. Gotta live life for today, you know.
"
,,
4,19,"Brian, don't you think
"
,,
4,19,"it's a little too early to be hitting the booze?
"
,,
4,19,"Why wait? You gotta live life
"
,,
4,19,"while you can and live it hard.
"
,,
4,19," The Chris Farley method? Good.
"
,,
4,19," Frank invited me back tonight.
"
,,
4,19,"I feel more exhilarated
"
,,
4,19,"than Peter did when he swam with the bulls.
"
,,
4,19,"Yeah, that's fair.
"
,,
4,19,"That's totally a fair score.
"
,,
4,19,"Brian, when you wear that suit, it looks like
"
,,
4,19,"you're taking a white poop. But it stuck.
"
,,
4,19,"Lois asked me to baby-sit you, so stay here
"
,,
4,19,"and be quiet. I'll be back after my first set.
"
,,
4,19,"What the hell am I supposed to do
"
,,
4,19,"to kill time?
"
,,
4,19,"Maybe I'll play 52 pickup.
"
,,
4,19,"This game's better with someone else.
"
,,
4,19,"Then they can say,
"
,,
4,19,"""I'm not going to pick up those cards. ""
"
,,
4,19,"Then I say, ""You have to, it's 52 pickup. ""
"
,,
4,19,"And they say,
"
,,
4,19,"""Well, what if I just leave them there?""
"
,,
4,19,"And I say, ""Those are my father's cards. ""
"
,,
4,19,"""You can't leave them there.
"
,,
4,19,"He's gonna be mad. "" Where am I?
"
,,
4,19,"Get outta here!
"
,,
4,19,"Whoa, easy, kid. These people
"
,,
4,19,"paid good money to get in here.
"
,,
4,19,"How much are you charging them to get out?
"
,,
4,19,"That was sensational. We'll be

4,19,"the biggest thing since Edison and electricity.
"
,,
4,19,"Look at Edison over there
"
,,
4,19,"with his damn electricity.
"
,,
4,19,"Edison! How about sharing
"
,,
4,19,"some of those light bulbs?
"
,,
4,19," Figure it out for yourself.
"
,,
4,19," We're freezing our asses off over here.
"
,,
4,19,"How do you think I feel? You get to look at
"
,,
4,19,"my great house. I look at that dark thing!
"
,,
4,19," What is that? A candle over there?
"
,,
4,19," Yeah, it's a candle. We're freezing over here.
"
,,
4,19,"No one in my family's
"
,,
4,19,"taken a bath in a month.
"
,,
4,19,"We stink! It stinks over here, you jerk!
"
,,
4,19," I can't hear you over my central heating.
"
,,
4,19," Go to hell!
"
,,
4,19,"Guess you haven't, cos you don't have a TV!</i>
"
,,
4,19,"How about I come over and kick your ass?
"
,,
4,19,"Ooh, yeah, come on over.
"
,,
4,19," What is this, Lois?
"
,,
4,19," It's jambalaya. It's a new recipe.
"
,,
4,19,"Peter.
"
,,
4,19,"Eat your food, mister.
"
,,
4,19,"All right, if you don't want it, put it
"
,,
4,19,"in your napkin. Peter! Put it in your napkin.
"
,,
4,19,"Put it in your napkin. I'm not gonna...
"
,,
4,19,"Peter! You know, some people
"
,,
4,19,"would be very happy to have this food.
"
,,
4,19,"Like John Goodman's family.
"
,,
4,19," Please, Daddy.
"
,,
4,19," I told you.
"
,,
4,19,"When I'm finished, you can have what's left!
"
,,
4,19,"There won't be any left.
"
,,
4,19,"There's never any left.
"
,,
4,19,"Happy Thanksgiving.
"
,,
4,19," Mom, why is the cable guy here?
"
,,
4,19," It's me. And I have something to tell you all.
"
,,
4,19,"Mom, Dad, I am a lesbian.
"
,,
4,19,"That is awesome.
"
,,
4,19,"Peter! Meg, you are not a lesbian.
"
,,
4,19,"I don't care what you think. All my lesbian
"
,,
4,19,"friends accept me and that's all that matters.
"
,,
4,19,"You're my daughter. I would accept you if you
"
,,
4,19,"were gay, blind or retarded, but you're not.
"
,,
4,19,"You guys don't care about me
"
,,
4,19,"and my struggle. I hate you!
"
,,
4,19,"I think you're trying to fit in
"
,,
4,19,"by pretending to be something you're not.
"
,,
4,19,"Like the time Peter pretended
"
,,
4,19,"to be racist to get out ofjury duty.
"
,,
4,19,"Awful lot of honkies in here.
"
,,
4,19,"Brian! There you are.
"
,,
4,19,"Do you have any idea what time it is?
"
,,
4,19,"Stewie was meant
"
,,
4,19,"to be in bed two hours ago.
"
,,
4,19,"Oh, yeah. He's... He was right here,
"
,,
4,19,"right next to me, like, four hours ago.
"
,,
4,19,"What?
"
,,
4,19,"Brian, you were supposed to watch him.
"
,,
4,19,"My little sweetie.
"
,,
4,19,"Brian, remember me? I'm the guy you
"
,,
4,19,"left standing at the counter at McDonald's.
"
,,
4,19,"It's funny. I tried to walk home. A lot
"
,,
4,19,"of hungry deer walking around at this hour.
"
,,
4,19,"Here's where the story gets fun.
"
,,
4,19,"You may have noticed I'm missing an ear.
"
,,
4,19,"Managed to pull it out of the deer's mouth
"
,,
4,19,"and put it in some ice I got at a 7-Eleven.
"
,,
4,19,"When you're ready to apologise,
"
,,
4,19,"just talk into this cup.
"
,,
4,19," Brian, this is inexcusable.
"
,,
4,19," What if something had happened to Stewie?
"
,,
4,19," My ear's in a cup. I guess that doesn't count.
"
,,
4,19," I'm not his baby-sitter. I have my own life.
"
,,
4,19,"This is cos you've been
"
,,
4,19,"with that Frank Sinatra Jr.
"
,,
4,19,"I am gonna call his mother Mia Farrow
"
,,
4,19,"and give her a piece of my mind.
"
,,
4,19,"You're gonna stop singing at that club.
"
,,
4,19,"Operator, Mia Farrow.
"
,,
4,19,"You stay out of my life!
"
,,
4,19,"What the hell is happening to you?
"
,,
4,19,"Don't worry. I don't need to go to the hospital.
"
,,
4,19,"I'll just use this Mr Potato Head piece.
"
,,
4,19," He bit me, Lois. The bastard bit me.
"
,,
4,19," Honey, I'm sure he didn't mean it.
"
,,
4,19,"Brian's going through some heavy stuff
"
,,
4,19,"right now. He almost died.
"
,,
4,19,"Listen, Peter...
"
,,
4,19,"I just want to apolo... You know what?
"
,,
4,19,"Forget it. I don't need this. I'm outta here.
"
,,
4,19," Look what you did, Peter.
"
,,
4,19," I can't help it.
"
,,
4,19,"I haven't been so scared
"
,,
4,19,"since I was mugged by Gene Shalit.
"
,,
4,19,"I'm not going to William Hurt you.</i>
"
,,
4,19,"and we'll all be Happy Gilmore.</i>
"
,,
4,19,"What?
"
,,
4,19,"So how's my
"
,,
4,19,"suddenly lesbian daughter doing?
"
,,
4,19,"Great. We're checking out naked girls.
"
,,
4,19,"I am so into girls.
"
,,
4,19,"Come on, Meg, you can stop the charade.
"
,,
4,19,"My God, you're as transparent
"
,,
4,19,"as your father was
"
,,
4,19,"when he pretended
"
,,
4,19,"to be a Hassidic Jew to get off work.
"
,,
4,19,"Good morning, Hebrews and Shebrews.
"
,,
4,19,"What a glorious Jewish day.
"
,,
4,19,"How about all those coupons in the
"
,,
4,19,"Sunday paper, huh? Some good deals there.
"
,,
4,19,"I went into a store last week
"
,,
4,19,"and they wanted 800 bucks for a TV,
"
,,
4,19,"but I ussed them down to 500.
"
,,
4,19,"It's not a charade, Mom. I am a lesbian.
"
,,
4,19,"What do I have to do to prove this to you?
"
,,
4,19,"Maybe if I'd seen you kiss your girlfriend.
"
,,
4,19," Fine.
"
,,
4,19," What was that? Is she your grandmother?
"
,,
4,19,"That's no kiss. Watch this.
"
,,
4,19,"I can't tell you how to lead your life.
"
,,
4,19,"If you don't wanna face the truth,
"
,,
4,19,"there's nothing I can do about it.
"
,,
4,19,"Chris, I'm all out of digital audio tape.
"
,,
4,19,"Oh, he's gone.
"
,,
4,19,"Can I get you to sign these release forms?
"
,,
4,19," Where the hell is Brian?
"
,,
4,19," I don't know, but I'd better go find him.
"
,,
4,19,"We can't sit watching infomercials all night.
"
,,
4,19,"Hello. How come I rich and you not?
"
,,
4,19,"How come you not sell real estate like I do?
"
,,
4,19,"How come I sleep with your wife while you at
"
,,
4,19,"work then pee in your toilet and don't flush?
"
,,
4,19,"And sometimes I open the back part and pee
"
,,
4,19,"there, so when you flush, pee come out.
"
,,
4,19,"You know why? Cos I'm smart.
"
,,
4,19,"I'm smart, you stupid. Call now.
"
,,
4,19,"Brian!
"
,,
4,19,"Brian!
"
,,
4,19,"Bri...
"
,,
4,19,"Who am I kidding? All those buttons,
"
,,
4,19,"I'll look like Steve Harvey. Brian!
"
,,
4,19,"I'll ask the cashier
"
,,
4,19,"if I can put this up in the window.
"
,,
4,19,"I definitely need a breath freshener.
"
,,
4,19,"But that's going to give me 11 items.
"
,,
4,19," That's fine.
"
,,
4,19," No, no, no. Rules is rules.
"
,,
4,19,"Let's see what I'm going to put back. I need
"
,,
4,19,"the Reynolds Wrap and the bathroom tissue.
"
,,
4,19,"I could do without the Triscuits,
"
,,
4,19,"but they sure are good.
"
,,
4,19,"I came down here in the first place.
"
,,
4,19,"You know what?
"
,,
4,19,"I'm not going to need the V8
"
,,
4,19,"cos I can just get some tomato juice
"
,,
4,19,"at the mini-mart down the street.
"
,,
4,19,"It's a little more expensive, but that's OK.
"
,,
4,19,"I like to help out a small business.
"
,,
4,19,"I hope it's OK if I pay you in pennies.
"
,,
4,19," Oh, God. A gutter? How clich.
"
,,
4,19," I don't know what went wrong.
"
,,
4,19,"I was just trying
"
,,
4,19,"to live for the moment, you know?
"
,,
4,19,"Because life can end so abruptly
"
,,
4,19,"and there's nothing you can do to stop it.
"
,,
4,19,"Is that why you've been
"
,,
4,19,"on this path to self-destruction?
"
,,
4,19,"You know, Brian, as smart as you are,
"
,,
4,19,"you've got to accept
"
,,
4,19,"that there are some things in life
"
,,
4,19,"that you just can't control.
"
,,
4,19,"You mean the way you can't control
"
,,
4,19,"the messed-up way that you laugh
"
,,
4,19,"when you think something's
"
,,
4,19,"really, really funny?
"
,,
4,19,"I don't understand why these cookies
"
,,
4,19,"are giving us all the fits.
"
,,
4,19,"Well, no wonder, Faith. That's not
"
,,
4,19,"baking powder. It's sneezing powder.
"
,,
4,19,"But I already brought a whole batch
"
,,
4,19,"to the church bake sale.
"
,,
4,19,"No wonder that priest
"
,,
4,19,"kept saying ""bless you"".
"
,,
4,19,"Yes, I accept that. Your problem is you think
"
,,
4,19,"that if you're not in control, nothing matters.
"
,,
4,19,"That you don't matter.
"
,,
4,19,"But you know what? You matter to someone.
"
,,
4,19,"You matter big time.
"
,,
4,19," Hey, Meg. What are you doing here?
"
,,
4,19," Sarah, I gotta get something off my chest.
"
,,
4,19,"Yes!
"
,,
4,19," I need to open up.
"
,,
4,19," Sweet.
"
,,
4,19,"So get ready cos here it is.
"
,,
4,19,"My mom was right.
"
,,
4,19," What do you mean?
"
,,
4,19," I'm not gay.
"
,,
4,19,"What? So all those rounds of golf
"
,,
4,19,"we played, those were all lies?
"
,,
4,19,"I'm so sorry. For the first time in my life,
"
,,
4,19,"I felt like I belonged.
"
,,
4,19,"And I wanted it to be true,
"
,,
4,19,"so I pretended to be something I'm not.
"
,,
4,19," You choose to be heterosexual?
"
,,
4,19," I thought being gay wasn't a choice.
"
,,
4,19," Well, not for guys.
"
,,
4,19," It was wrong to mislead you. I should go.
"
,,
4,19,"That was awful. That was just awful.
"
,,
4,19,"What do you think, Mark?
"
,,
4,19,"I don't know, man.
"
,,
4,19,"We didn't get the shots we need.
"
,,
4,19,"What do you think, Mike? I mean,
"
,,
4,19,"if you saw action going on in front of you,
"
,,
4,19,"would you know instinctively to centre it?
"
,,
4,19,"I don't know. Can someone take my soda out
"
,,
4,19,"of the ice box, please, so it doesn't freeze?
"
,,
4,19," Lady!
"
,,
4,19," You're fired.
"
,,
4,19," Frank, there you are.
"
,,
4,19," Mia Farrow?

"

"
,,
4,20,"Well, when I stopped
"
,,
4,20,"over earlier,
"
,,
4,20,"I noticed Lois clipping her toenails
"
,,
4,20,"and I thought:
"
,,
4,20,"""Oh, man,
"
,,
4,20,"I gotta get in on that. ""
"
,,
4,20,"Huh.
"
,,
4,20,"Yeah, I don't think
"
,,
4,20,"I'm going to my reunion.
"
,,
4,20,"Everybody's all got
"
,,
4,20,"their nice cars
"
,,
4,20,"and their big, important
"
,,
4,20,"jobs, and their fancy hats,
"
,,
4,20,"and their fresh strawberries so big
"

4,20,"you can eat them like a hand fruit.
"
,,
4,20,"Peter, everyone lies at those things.
"
,,
4,20,"Just tell them you're a big shot.
"
,,
4,20,"Wait a second, Joe,
"
,,
4,20,"that's a great idea.
"
,,
4,20,"Boy, imagine what it would be

"

"
,,
4,20,"Oh, I... You know what? Just give me
"
,,
4,20,"till next Friday, I'll have it for.
"
,,
4,20,"Oh, that's funny. I could have sworn
"
,,
4,20,"I said, have it today.
"
,,
4,20,"Yeah, I don't
"
,,
4,20,"have it, sorry.
"
,,
4,20,"Oh, well.
"
,,
4,20,"All right, then.
"
,,
4,20,"Mmm, that's good OJ.
"
,,
4,20," Yeah, that hurt? That hurt?
"
,,
4,20," What the hell?
"
,,
4,20,"Yeah, that doesn't
"

4,20,"feel so good, does it?
"
,,
4,20," No, huh?
"
,,
4,20," Oh, oh. Oh, oh.
"

4,20,"Yeah, that's what
"
,,
4,20,"happens, man.
"

4,20," Yeah, that's what happens.
"

4,20,"Where's the money, man?
"
,,
4,20,"Where's my money?
"
,,
4,20,"You've got till 5:00, you hear me?
"
,,
4,20,"You got till 5:00.
"
,,
4,20," You freakin' psychopath!
"
,,
4,20," Clean yourself up.
"
,,
4,20,"Peter, this is ridiculous.
"
,,
4,20,"Why can't you just be yourself?
"
,,
4,20,"Lois, just go along with
"
,,
4,20,"it. Act like I'm a big shot.
"
,,
4,20," Hey, Peter Griffin, is that you?
"
,,
4,20," Hey, Mike, long time no see.
"
,,
4,20," Wow, what, uh... what's all this?
"
,,
4,20," Oh, this? Oh, I just came from work.
"
,,
4,20,"I'm a Secret Agent
"
,,
4,20,"Astronaut Millionaire.
"
,,
4,20,"Cool. Where'd you
"
,,
4,20,"get the cowboy hat?
"
,,
4,20,"Space.
"
,,
4,20,"Oh, by the way,
"
,,
4,20,"this is my friend, Tom.
"
,,
4,20,"You're Tom Brady
"
,,
4,20,"from the New England Patriots!
"
,,
4,20,"Oh man, I got to tell you,
"
,,
4,20,"you kick ass, man.
"
,,
4,20,"In fact, I was just saying
"
,,
4,20,"that the other day,
"
,,
4,20,"to all the guys down
"
,,
4,20,"at the brewery.
"
,,
4,20,"Brewery?
"
,,
4,20,"I thought you were
"
,,
4,20,"a cowboy astronaut millionaire.
"
,,
4,20,"He's a fake!
"
,,
4,20,"Look, this cowboy hat
"
,,
4,20,"comes right off.
"
,,
4,20,"Coming here was
"
,,
4,20,"a huge mistake, Lois.
"
,,
4,20,"Peter, I know you're humiliated,
"
,,
4,20,"but getting drunk is not the answer.
"
,,
4,20,"Uh-oh. Either my esophagus just got
"
,,
4,20,"shorter, or I'm about to throw up.
"
,,
4,20,"Peter, that was amazing.
"
,,
4,20,"I've never a seen a guy your size
"
,,
4,20,"who could move like that.
"
,,
4,20,"How would you like to play
"
,,
4,20,"for the New England Patriots?
"
,,
4,20,"Oh. I'd love to.
"
,,
4,20,"Say, listen, uh, Tom, could you get me
"
,,
4,20,"a towel? I threw up on the floor.
"
,,
4,20,"Sure.
"
,,
4,20,"And could you also
"
,,
4,20,"get another towel?
"
,,
4,20,"I also threw up on
"
,,
4,20,"this gentleman's bare lap.
"
,,
4,20," Wet the towel, Tom?</i>

"

4,20,"I want to thank God.
"

4,20,"Uh, I want to thank the Lord God.

4,20,"to thank the Devil, too.
"

4,20,"Uh, you know, 'cause that's,
"

4,20,"uh, that's why God's there.
"
,,
4,20,"He's, uh...
"
,,
4,20,"he's minding the fence, making sure

4,20,"that guy never comes back.
"
,,
4,20,"Uh...
"

4,20,"You know, if it weren't for the Devil,

4,20,"I'm so sorry.
"
,,
4,20,"Look, you can use our
"
,,
4,20,"shower if you want.
"
,,
4,20,"No, it's okay. It's just
"
,,
4,20,"a little spot. It'll come out.
"
,,
4,20,"Well, that's not gonna come out.
"
,,
4,20,"You better take a shower.
"
,,
4,20," Mom, let me look!
"
,,
4,20," Meg, stop shoving.
"
,,
4,20,"You wouldn't even know
"
,,
4,20,"what to do with it.
"
,,
4,20,"He's closer to my age,
"
,,
4,20,"you cow.
"
,,
4,20,"What the hell is this?
"
,,
4,20,"Oh, hi, Stewie.
"
,,
4,20,"We were just leaving.
"
,,
4,20,"I say, what the devil is all
"
,,
4,20,"the fuss about? I don't get it.
"
,,
4,20,"What's in there?
"
,,
4,20,"Bing, bong! Hello!
"
,,
4,20," Hey. What's goin' on?
"
,,
4,20," What the hell?! Get out of here!
"
,,
4,20,"Well, we're on the same team.
"
,,
4,20,"We shower together.
"
,,
4,20,"Yeah, in the locker room.
"
,,
4,20," Yeah, yeah, come here, you.
"
,,
4,20," Ah, stop, knock it off.
"
,,
4,20,"What are you crazy?
"
,,
4,20,"We're just a couple of guys messing
"
,,
4,20,"around. That's what we are.
"
,,
4,20,"Ooh, ooh, quiet, everybody,
"
,,
4,20,"my commercial's on.
"
,,
4,20,"Hi, I'm Peter Griffin
"
,,
4,20,"of the New England Patriots.
"
,,
4,20,"I'm here to kick off the
"
,,
4,20,"Touchdown of Savings Weekend,
"
,,
4,20,"at Wilkins Hyundai and Subaru.
"
,,
4,20,"We will blitz the competition,
"
,,
4,20,"and in no time,
"
,,
4,20,"you'll be driving your new Hyundai
"
,,
4,20,"or Subaru right to a touchdown.
"
,,
4,20,"and Subaru</i>
"
,,
4,20,"and Subarus.</i>
"
,,
4,20,"Mom, the game's about to start.
"
,,
4,20,"Where's Dad?
"
,,
4,20,"I don't know, Chris.
"
,,
4,20,"And I'm starting to get worried.
"
,,
4,20,"I think all this success
"
,,
4,20,"might be going to his head.
"
,,
4,20,"Do you know he spent
"
,,
4,20,"$30,000 on a wax sculpture,
"
,,
4,20,"of Harriet Tubman
"
,,
4,20,"doing Gwyneth Paltrow?
"
,,
4,20,"Yeah.
"
,,
4,20,"Yeah, that is
"
,,
4,20,"happening for real.
"
,,
4,20,"Yeah.
"
,,
4,20,"I'll enjoy that more tomorrow.
"
,,
4,20,"Where the hell is Griffin?
"
,,
4,20,"It's almost time for kickoff.
"
,,
4,20,"Well, I guess we have
"
,,
4,20,"to start without him.
"
,,
4,20,"What do you think, huh? I got this
"
,,
4,20,"for doing that car dealership ad.
"
,,
4,20,"All right, enough messing around, huh?
"
,,
4,20,"Let's play this game.
"
,,
4,20,"Let's play
"
,,
4,20,"some football.
"
,,
4,20,"Griffin, I'm getting really
"
,,
4,20,"tired of your cocky attitude.
"
,,
4,20,"How many times have I told you,
"
,,
4,20,"no showboating?!
"
,,
4,20,"Relax, Tom, I'm just having a little
"
,,
4,20,"fun. I got it under control.
"
,,
4,20,"Okay, 28-Z right,
"
,,
4,20,"pitch left,
"
,,
4,20,"on one, on one.
"
,,
4,20,"Ready? Break!
"
,,
4,20,"Ready? Green 54! Green 54!
"
,,
4,20,"Set, hut, hut!
"
,,
4,20,"Yeah!
"
,,
4,20,"Huh, there might be some hope
"
,,
4,20,"for this guy after all.
"
,,
4,20,"Damn it, Griffin!
"
,,
4,20,"I said no showboating!
"
,,
4,20,"This calls for a victory tune!
"
,,
4,20,"Now, a woman who'll kiss on the very
"
,,
4,20,"first date is usually a hussy.
"
,,
4,20,"And a woman who'll kiss on the
"
,,
4,20,"second time out Is anything but fussy
"
,,
4,20,"But a woman who'll wait
"
,,
4,20,"till the third time around
"
,,
4,20,"Head in the clouds,
"
,,
4,20,"feet on the ground
"
,,
4,20,"She's the girl he's glad he's found.

"
,,
4,20,"just to raise the curtain.
"
,,
4,20,"Walk around twice

4,20,"Once more in

4,20,"All right.
"
,,
4,20,"I made a touchdown.
"
,,
4,20,"Griffin, you're fired!
"
,,
4,20," For what?
"
,,
4,20," We've had it with your crap.
"
,,
4,20,"I talked to the coach and he's selling
"
,,
4,20,"your contract to another team.
"
,,
4,20,"And the only one that'll take you,
"
,,
4,20,"is the worst football team in Europe:
"
,,
4,20,"The London Silly Nannies.
"
,,
4,20,"So, Brian, we're even now, right?
"
,,
4,20,"Ready to start
"
,,
4,20,"a new life in England.
"
,,
4,20,"I've got my money, your wounds
"
,,
4,20,"have healed up nicely.
"
,,
4,20,"What do you say we let
"
,,
4,20,"bygones be bygones, hmm?
"
,,
4,20,"You shot me in both my
"
,,
4,20,"knees then lit me on fire.
"
,,
4,20," Piss off.
"
,,
4,20," All right, all right.
"
,,
4,20,"I tell you what, you get
"
,,
4,20,"one free revenge shot at me.
"
,,
4,20,"Okay.
"
,,
4,20,"But I'm not gonna tell you
"
,,
4,20,"when it's coming.
"
,,
4,20,"Ah, this is
"
,,
4,20,"gonna be fun.
"
,,
4,20,"Peter, this is crazy.
"
,,
4,20,"Isn't there any way the Patriots
"
,,
4,20,"could let you back on the team?
"
,,
4,20,"Nah, they said
"
,,
4,20,"the decision was final.
"
,,
4,20,"It's all right, Lois,
"
,,
4,20,"I can make the best of this.
"
,,
4,20,"I mean, a British football team
"
,,
4,20,"can't be that bad.
"
,,
4,20,"Uh, excuse me. Hey, there. Hi.
"
,,
4,20,"I'm, uh, Peter Griffin.
"
,,
4,20,"I'm your new player.
"
,,
4,20,"Oh, yes, Peter,
"
,,
4,20,"welcome to the Silly Nannies.
"
,,
4,20,"I'm the quarterback, Lesley.
"
,,
4,20,"This is our team.
"
,,
4,20,"If you'll marry me
"
,,
4,20,"I'll dig for you and rake for you
"
,,
4,20,"If you'll marry me
"
,,
4,20,"I'll scrub for you and bake for you
"
,,
4,20,"If you'll marry me
"
,,
4,20,"All others I'll forsake for you
"
,,
4,20,"All this will I do
"
,,
4,20,"if you'll marry me
"
,,
4,20,"All this will I do
"
,,
4,20,"If you'll marry me.
"
,,
4,20,"Oh, crap.
"
,,
4,20,"Well, I guess living in a London flat
"
,,
4,20,"isn't gonna be too bad, huh?
"
,,
4,20,"Mom, there's no water in the toilet.
"
,,
4,20,"First of all, Chris, it's called a loo.
"
,,
4,20,"Second, there's no water in it,
"
,,
4,20,"because everybody here
"
,,
4,20,"just uses Elizabeth Hurley.
"
,,
4,20,"All right, well, where is she?
"
,,
4,20,"'Cause I need her now!
"
,,
4,20,"You're watching BBC 4.
"
,,
4,20,"Ellen, there's moisture on
"
,,
4,20,"the outside of my glass.
"
,,
4,20,"It's condensation, Johnny.
"
,,
4,20,"But what about the fog
"
,,
4,20,"on the windows?
"
,,
4,20,"It's not fog, Johnny.
"
,,
4,20,"It, too, is called condensation.
"
,,
4,20,"Con-den-sation.
"
,,
4,20,"Hey, Peter, how was your first
"
,,
4,20,"Silly Nannies practice?
"
,,
4,20,"It sucked, Lois.
"
,,
4,20,"Those Silly Nannies are
"
,,
4,20,"just a bunch of losers.
"
,,
4,20,"Pack your bags, we're going home.
"
,,
4,20,"What, you're just giving up?
"
,,
4,20,"Look, Peter, I know you're upset
"
,,
4,20,"because you blew your opportunity
"
,,
4,20,"with the Patriots but...
"
,,
4,20,"This is your chance
"
,,
4,20,"to redeem yourself.
"
,,
4,20,"Now I bet if you really tried,
"
,,
4,20,"you could turn that team around.
"
,,
4,20,"You know what, Lois?
"
,,
4,20,"When you were talking about
"
,,
4,20,"that sale at T.J. Maxx just now,
"
,,
4,20,"I came up with an idea.
"
,,
4,20,"I am gonna turn that team around.
"
,,
4,20,"And we'll challenge
"
,,
4,20,"the Patriots to a game,
"
,,
4,20,"and we'll kick their ass!
"
,,
4,20,"Oh, man, what an attractive woman.
"
,,
4,20," Hello?
"
,,
4,20," Hey, Brady!
"
,,
4,20," You're dead!
"
,,
4,20," Listen, Leno!
"
,,
4,20,"You keep calling here and threatening
"
,,
4,20,"me, I'm gonna notify the police.
"
,,
4,20,"Leno? No, no,
"
,,
4,20,"this is Peter Griffin.
"
,,
4,20,"I'm calling to challenge you
"
,,
4,20,"to a grudge match
"
,,
4,20,"between the Patriots and
"
,,
4,20,"the London Silly Nannies.
"
,,
4,20,"Huh. Well, Griffin.
"
,,
4,20,"If you want to embarrass
"
,,
4,20,"yourself, be my guest.
"
,,
4,20,"Good. What do you
"
,,
4,20,"say, England?
"
,,
4,20," Two weeks from now?
"
,,
4,20," See you there.
"
,,
4,20," Hello?
"
,,
4,20," Hey, Brady!
"
,,
4,20,"What kind of suit you
"
,,
4,20,"want to be buried in?
"
,,
4,20,"Oh, you kids are gonna love this.
"
,,
4,20,"England has such a rich heritage
"
,,
4,20,"of great theater.
"
,,
4,20,"Cramsat on the bingum
"
,,
4,20,"with the gam gum?
"
,,
4,20,"Treaches on the upper
"
,,
4,20,"with the trang sang.
"
,,
4,20,"Croppers to you,
"
,,
4,20,"you crang sang lover.
"
,,
4,20,"She rogered the boogley!
"
,,
4,20,"All right, now listen up,
"
,,
4,20,"you limey bum sniffers.
"
,,
4,20,"If we're gonna beat the New England
"
,,
4,20,"Patriots next week,
"
,,
4,20,"I got to toughen you up.
"
,,
4,20,"So you're gonna get in shape
"
,,
4,20,"the way American athletes do:
"
,,
4,20,"Taking steroids.
"
,,
4,20,"I say, Jenkins, you give me
"
,,
4,20,"that dirty look one more time,
"
,,
4,20,"and I've a good mind to get into my PJ's
"
,,
4,20,"and have a pillow fight with you.
"
,,
4,20,"Very well,
"
,,
4,20,"then. En garde!
"
,,
4,20," I like your gown.
"
,,
4,20," I like yours.
"
,,
4,20,"When's the beating
"
,,
4,20,"gonna come, Brian?
"
,,
4,20,"Just tell me when it's gonna come!
"
,,
4,20,"Just do something, anything!
"
,,
4,20,"Look, look, I'll do it.
"
,,
4,20,"I'll do it first.
"
,,
4,20,"Look, look, I'll do it even worse.
"
,,
4,20,"Oh, oh, oh, look how hurt I am.
"
,,
4,20,"We're even now!
"
,,
4,20,"You're going down, Brady!
"
,,
4,20,"You're the one who's
"
,,
4,20,"going down, Griffin!
"
,,
4,20,"What the hell?
"
,,
4,20,"Those men are tremendous
"
,,
4,20,"in stature.
"
,,
4,20,"And they're coming
"
,,
4,20,"straight at us!
"
,,
4,20,"We'll take my carriage!
"
,,
4,20,"Ah, crap.
"
,,
4,20,"Well, I'm still here,
"
,,
4,20,"you bastards!
"
,,
4,20,"So let's do this!
"
,,
4,20,"Oh. Hey, Brady. You gonna gloat
"
,,
4,20,"and call me a loser now?
"
,,
4,20,"Actually, Peter, you're
"
,,
4,20,"not a loser at all.
"
,,
4,20,"What you did just now
"
,,
4,20,"was pretty ballsy.
"
,,
4,20," Really?
"
,,
4,20," Absolutely!
"
,,
4,20,"For one guy to stand up to the entire
"
,,
4,20,"New England Patriots team,
"
,,
4,20,"that's a winner in my book.
"
,,
4,20,"Wow. Thanks, Tom Brady.
"
,,
4,20,"Peter! Oh, my God,
"
,,
4,20,"are you all right?
"
,,
4,20," Yeah.
"
,,
4,20," Can you move your legs?
"
,,
4,20," Yeah.
"
,,
4,20," Oh, good.
"
,,
4,20,"I thought you were gonna be a vegetable.
"
,,
4,20,"And I got to tell you, Peter,
"
,,
4,20,"I- I just don't think
"
,,
4,20,"I have it in me.
"
,,
4,20,"I mean, if you can't move,
"
,,
4,20,"it's over.
"
,,
4,20,"I love you,
"
,,
4,20,"too, honey.
"
,,
4,20,"Let's go home.

4,21,"take a shot at it. Talk it out.
"
,,
4,21,"Is it ""Alex Karras in Webster""?
"

4,21,"I don't believe it.
"
,,
4,21,"Oh, my God! I just took a

"

4,21,"Okay, you have $1,300.
"

4,21,"Why don't you go ahead and pick

4,21,"Hey, how much for that fat guy in the

"
,,
4,21," That's you.

4,21," Oh, oh, embarrassing.

4,21,"Okay, well, in that case, I'll take

4,21,"Oh, sweetie, you look so handsome on TV.

4,21,"I can't believe you actually won.

4,21,"But I suppose it's not the strangest
"

4,21,"thing I've seen on a game show.
"
,,
4,21,"Like when Adam West was on Jeopardy.
"
,,
4,21,"All right, players, the
"
,,
4,21,"answer once again is:
"
,,
4,21,"""It was the first spacecraft

4,21,"to land on the surface of Mars. ""
"

4,21,"Adam, what was your response?

4,21,"""Kebert Xela. ""
"

4,21,"Only saying his name backwards can send him

4,21,"All right, whip'em out, woman.
"
,,
4,21,"It's time for the afternoon meal.
"
,,
4,21,"My goodness, Stewie.
"
,,
4,21,"I guess you're hungry.
"
,,
4,21,"Honey, not so rough this time.
"
,,
4,21,"Mommy's very sore.
"
,,
4,21,"And by the way, let's be clear.
"
,,
4,21,"I only like you as a friend.

4,21,"your maid for the week.

4,21,"You maid,
"
,,
4,21,"clean for me, Peter.
"
,,
4,21,"You clean Peter mess.
"
,,
4,21,"Peter, stop it.
"
,,
4,21,"Welcome to our home, Joan.
"
,,
4,21,"I'm Lois.
"
,,
4,21,"Won't you come in?
"
,,
4,21,"Oh, boy, my own maid.
"
,,
4,21,"This is going to kick more ass
"
,,
4,21,"than that magical ride I took.
"
,,
4,21,"great space coaster</i>
"
,,
4,21,"Come and ride a fantasy</i>
"
,,
4,21,"fly fast and free</i>
"

"
,,
4,21,"Well, we are officially lost.
"
,,
4,21," On the great space coa...
"
,,
4,21," Shut up, Ricky, just shut up right now!
"
,,
4,21,"Unless the next words out
"
,,
4,21,"of your mouth are directions
"
,,
4,21,"how to get back to the fish skeleton, I'm
"
,,
4,21,"going to punch you right in the stomach.
"
,,
4,21,"Joan, it's great to have you here.
"
,,
4,21,"No one's cleaned my belly
"
,,
4,21,"button in a long time.
"
,,
4,21,"Lois is afraid to go near there
"
,,
4,21,"and my fingers are too thick.
"
,,
4,21,"What is this?
"
,,
4,21,"A carton of Parliaments?
"
,,
4,21,"I haven't smoked in ten years.
"
,,
4,21,"Hey, keep diggin.
"
,,
4,21,"Oh, Coleco Vision.
"
,,
4,21,"Yeah. This could be a fun afternoon.
"
,,
4,21,"Mr. Griffin, this is
"
,,
4,21,"unbelievably humiliating.
"
,,
4,21,"Hey, hey, Lois, wants me to go to
"
,,
4,21,"the store, and the car's low on gas.
"
,,
4,21,"Oh, crap.
"
,,
4,21,"This is truly a sight to behold.
"
,,
4,21,"An awesome spectacle.
"
,,
4,21,"Peter Griffin, a once-great champion
"
,,
4,21,"of the motor speedway
"
,,
4,21,"now a study in moppishness.
"
,,
4,21,"The hell I am!
"
,,
4,21,"We now return to
"
,,
4,21,"Malcolm In The Middle.
"
,,
4,21,"And I told you boys to pick up your clothes
"
,,
4,21,"and who left the wet towel on the bed?!
"
,,
4,21,"I swear to God, sometimes I
"
,,
4,21,"feel like just going on strike!
"
,,
4,21,"What would you all do
"
,,
4,21,"if went on strike, huh?!
"
,,
4,21,"What would you do?!
"
,,
4,21,"I'm talking to you!
"
,,
4,21,"You know what?! That's what I'm going
"
,,
4,21,"to do! I'm going to go on strike,
"
,,
4,21,"and you can all try living without me!
"
,,
4,21,"What do you think about that, huh?!
"
,,
4,21,"That's what I'm going to do! I'm going
"
,,
4,21,"to do that! I'm going to go on strike!
"
,,
4,21,"Kids,
"
,,
4,21,"we're free.
"
,,
4,21,"We're finally free.
"
,,
4,21,"Ow, damn, that hurts.
"
,,
4,21,"What happened?
"
,,
4,21,"I was breast-feeding Stewie and he bit me again.
"
,,
4,21,"I think he might have even broken the skin.
"
,,
4,21,"I see. Um...
"
,,
4,21,"maybe I should, uh, you know, uh,
"
,,
4,21,"look at it. Uh...
"
,,
4,21,"I- I have seen a lot of medical shows.
"
,,
4,21,"You see, the areola is very tender here,
"
,,
4,21,"and I think one of his new teeth may
"
,,
4,21,"have bitten down right on the duct.
"
,,
4,21,"I'm sorry. What?
"
,,
4,21,"I don't know what to do, Brian.
"
,,
4,21,"Breast'feeding's just so painful
"
,,
4,21,"since Stewie's teeth are coming in.
"
,,
4,21,"Now I know how Alec Baldwin feels
"
,,
4,21,"when he feeds his brothers.
"
,,
4,21,"There you go. There you go.
"
,,
4,21,"Eat up, Steven. You're the weakest.
"
,,
4,21,"Well, maybe it's time to wean Stewie.
"
,,
4,21,"Huh, I suppose it would
"
,,
4,21,"make my life easier.
"
,,
4,21,"You know what? I'll give it a try.
"
,,
4,21,"Thanks, Brian.
"
,,
4,21,"No problem.
"
,,
4,21,"Uh...
"
,,
4,21,"any, any other problems
"
,,
4,21,"you have, too, like,
"
,,
4,21,"for example, around your underpants...
"
,,
4,21,"that you want me to take a look at,
"
,,
4,21,"I could, I could take a look at that, too.
"
,,
4,21,"Huh?
"
,,
4,21,"Please pull down your underpants.
"
,,
4,21,"All right, boys, it's my maid's last night,
"
,,
4,21,"so we got to make the most of it.
"
,,
4,21,"I filled this watermelon with chocolate
"
,,
4,21,"pudding and M-80 firecrackers.
"
,,
4,21,"Hey, Meg, will you hold this for Daddy?
"
,,
4,21,"Okay, why?
"
,,
4,21,"Uh, it's a present.
"
,,
4,21,"It's a ""Thanks for being
"
,,
4,21,"such a sweetie"" watermelon.
"
,,
4,21," So you'll hang on to that?
"
,,
4,21," Yeah, sure.
"
,,
4,21,"This is weird.
"
,,
4,21,"Am I supposed to eat this?
"
,,
4,21,"AHHH! I hate you! 
"
,,
4,21,"I hate you!
"
,,
4,21,"Oh, maid?
"
,,
4,21,"Oh, my God...
"
,,
4,21,"Everybody, this is Joan.
"
,,
4,21," Hi.
"
,,
4,21," Hello.
"
,,
4,21,"Uh, uh, hey, there. I mean, it's
"
,,
4,21,"nice to pleasure your acquaintance.
"
,,
4,21,"I mean, uh,
"
,,
4,21,"would you like to go out
"
,,
4,21,"to dinner tomorrow night?
"
,,
4,21," I'd love to.
"
,,
4,21," God, he works fast.
"
,,
4,21,"Hey, Quagmire, is that a
"
,,
4,21,"banana in your pocket?
"
,,
4,21,"Or an erection in your pocket?
"
,,
4,21," Do you want to say 9:00?
"
,,
4,21," Sure.
"
,,
4,21,"See you then.
"
,,
4,21,"Oh, my God.
"
,,
4,21,"I'm in love.
"
,,
4,21,"Time for dinner, sweetie.
"
,,
4,21,"Very well, then, take off your shirt.
"
,,
4,21,"No, honey, no, no. Tonight we're
"
,,
4,21,"going to have formula instead.
"
,,
4,21,"That's more disgusting than when Peter
"
,,
4,21,"went through that Daisy Duke's phase.
"
,,
4,21,"So who's up for some
"
,,
4,21,"hoops at the park, huh?
"
,,
4,21,"Oh, there you are.
"
,,
4,21,"Come here, you basketball.
"
,,
4,21,"AHHH! 
"
,,
4,21,"It's like a walrus flossing.
"
,,
4,21,"Now I know it's different than you're
"
,,
4,21,"used to, but you'll see. It's just as good.
"
,,
4,21,"Yes, that's what we were promised about
"
,,
4,21,"Jim Belushi some 25 laugh-free years ago.
"
,,
4,21,"Wow, it's so lovely here, Glenn.
"
,,
4,21,"Well, this is our three-week anniversary,
"
,,
4,21,"Joan. I wanted this date to be special.
"
,,
4,21,"You know this place is unique because if
"
,,
4,21,"you're lucky, some nights around sunset,
"
,,
4,21,"the screaming black dolphins come out.
"
,,
4,21,"Oh, wow, really?
"
,,
4,21,"I've heard they're just beautiful.
"
,,
4,21," What's going on, man?
"
,,
4,21," Oh, what's going on yo'self?
"
,,
4,21," I almost drowned yesterday.
"
,,
4,21," Oh, man, it's wet out here!
"
,,
4,21," Oh, look at them.
"
,,
4,21," They're magical, aren't they?
"
,,
4,21,"Listen, Joan...
"
,,
4,21,"I have something very
"
,,
4,21,"important to ask you.
"
,,
4,21," Mm-hmm?</i>
"
,,
4,21,"long I can hold my breath.</i>
"
,,
4,21," What is it, Glenn?</i>
"
,,
4,21,"Joan... I've decided I want
"
,,
4,21,"to spend my life with you.
"
,,
4,21,"Will you marry me?
"
,,
4,21,"Of course, I will!
"
,,
4,21,"Nothing would make me happier
"
,,
4,21,"than to be Mrs. Quagmire.
"
,,
4,21,"Hey, man, I see you got
"
,,
4,21,"some seaweed on your tail.
"
,,
4,21,"Where? Wha..?
"
,,
4,21,"You know I'm just playing with ya.
"
,,
4,21,"Man, you all... Oh! I thought you were
"
,,
4,21,"talking about the other seaweed.
"
,,
4,21,"You know I got jokes!
"
,,
4,21,"I'm going to slap you with my fin.
"
,,
4,21,"Man, I never would have
"
,,
4,21,"thought Quagmire'd get married.
"
,,
4,21,"No, no, I know Quagmire and I'm telling
"
,,
4,21,"you, this has got to be some kind of prank.
"
,,
4,21,"You know, like that prank
"
,,
4,21,"I pulled on Ashton Kutcher.
"
,,
4,21,"Ashton, come here.
"
,,
4,21,"You've just been tomahawked.
"
,,
4,21,"That's my show.
"
,,
4,21,"Tomahawked.
"
,,
4,21," So, how's the weaning going?
"
,,
4,21," Oh, it's horrible.
"
,,
4,21,"Giving up breast milk is the
"
,,
4,21,"hardest thing I've ever had to do.
"
,,
4,21,"I'll bet the Founding Fathers had an
"
,,
4,21,"easier time writing the Bill of Rights.
"
,,
4,21,"All right, we're done.
"
,,
4,21,"You think the language in the
"
,,
4,21,"Second Amendment is clear enough?
"
,,
4,21,"You know, about the right to bear arms?
"
,,
4,21,"Of course it's clear. Every American
"
,,
4,21,"has the right to hang a pair of bear arms
"
,,
4,21,"on their wall. How could
"
,,
4,21,"that possibly be misconstrued?
"
,,
4,21,"All right. Fantastic, then.
"
,,
4,21,"Wait. You know what?
"
,,
4,21,"Before we send this to the printer,
"
,,
4,21,"let's take that abortion thing out.
"
,,
4,21,"Boy, I never thought we'd be going to
"
,,
4,21,"Quagmire's for an engagement party.
"
,,
4,21,"I'm telling you guys, he's putting
"
,,
4,21,"us on. He's the same old Quagmire.
"
,,
4,21,"Hey, there, neighbors-are you lost?
"
,,
4,21,"I'm just joshing. Of course we're
"
,,
4,21,"expecting you. Come on in, friends.
"
,,
4,21,"You all just take your shoes off, there.
"
,,
4,21,"Joan and I kind of do the Japanese thing.
"
,,
4,21,"Uh-oh.
"
,,
4,21,"Foot odor.
"
,,
4,21,"I have to go. I have, uh...
"
,,
4,21,"terrible foot odor.
"
,,
4,21,"Glenn, your place looks wonderful.
"
,,
4,21,"I feel like I can touch
"
,,
4,21,"things in here now.
"
,,
4,21,"We brought you guys a bottle of wine.
"
,,
4,21," Ooh! Montrachet!
"
,,
4,21," I like our friends.
"
,,
4,21,"So, Joan and I just love
"
,,
4,21,"Without a Trace, don't we, honey?
"
,,
4,21," Yeah, it's all right.
"
,,
4,21," We think it's all right.
"
,,
4,21,"What are you talking about?
"
,,
4,21,"You hate CBS.
"
,,
4,21,"Ooh, hate is a word
"
,,
4,21,"we don't use in this house.
"
,,
4,21,"Joan and I always say, if you don't have
"
,,
4,21,"anything nice to say about someone
"
,,
4,21,"don't say anything at all.
"
,,
4,21,"We say that, right, honey?
"
,,
4,21," Sometimes.
"
,,
4,21," Sometimes we say that.
"
,,
4,21,"Hey, Quagmire. Check out this
"
,,
4,21,"month's Hustler, huh?
"
,,
4,21,"Quagmire?
"
,,
4,21,"Now, this is neat.
"
,,
4,21,"These people have put an old-fashioned Colonial
"
,,
4,21,"spinning wheel in the center of their living room.
"
,,
4,21,"As furniture.
"
,,
4,21,"Oh, that's what I want in my house.
"
,,
4,21,"All right, Quagmire,
"
,,
4,21,"time for your lap dance.
"
,,
4,21,"No, guys, I can't do that.
"
,,
4,21,"It's degrading to women.
"
,,
4,21,"Come on, Quagmire, it's got to be you.
"
,,
4,21,"I'm married, Cleveland's got foot odor,
"
,,
4,21,"and Joe's dead from the waist down.
"
,,
4,21,"AHHH!! Why do you bring me here?!
"
,,
4,21,"Oh, Brian, my breasts are so sore.
"
,,
4,21,"And they've gotten so engorged from
"
,,
4,21,"the weaning, I've gone up two bra sizes.
"
,,
4,21,"Well... what did you
"
,,
4,21,"do with the old bras?
"
,,
4,21,"Okay, got to time this just right.
"
,,
4,21,"One, two, three.
"
,,
4,21,"Help! Somebody get this baby off me!
"
,,
4,21,"Stewie!
"
,,
4,21,"I'm so sorry.
"
,,
4,21,"By the way, you call those
"
,,
4,21,"cheap implants boobs?
"
,,
4,21,"Those aren't boobs, they're lies!
"
,,
4,21,"I can't believe it.
"
,,
4,21,"Quagmire's gone all
"
,,
4,21,"sissy-man Alan Alda on us.
"
,,
4,21,"Well, what can we do about it?
"
,,
4,21,"The wedding's tomorrow.
"
,,
4,21,"There's only one thing to do.
"
,,
4,21,"We gotta break it up.
"
,,
4,21,"Gosh, Peter, thanks so
"
,,
4,21,"much for being my best man.
"
,,
4,21,"No, it's my pleasure.
"
,,
4,21,"In fact, I got a wedding
"
,,
4,21,"surprise for you.
"
,,
4,21,"All right, back it up, guys.
"
,,
4,21,"I know you've got a foot fetish so I
"
,,
4,21,"got you this Statue of Liberty's foot.
"
,,
4,21,"Oh, thanks, Peter, but Joan's
"
,,
4,21,"all the foot I need now.
"
,,
4,21,"What?
"
,,
4,21,"But, Quagmire, that's the real
"
,,
4,21,"foot from the Statue of...
"
,,
4,21," No, no, I'm okay.
"
,,
4,21," Hey.
"
,,
4,21,"Hey. Do you have any idea
"
,,
4,21,"what I went through to get this?
"
,,
4,21,"A lot.
"
,,
4,21,"A real lot.
"
,,
4,21,"You think this is just: ""Oh, here comes
"
,,
4,21,"Peter with the Statue of Liberty's foot?""
"
,,
4,21,"""Oh, isn't that a gas?""
"
,,
4,21,"No, no. The reality,
"
,,
4,21,"the real reality of getting
"
,,
4,21,"this together was staggering.
"
,,
4,21,"You know?
"
,,
4,21,"This cost me $437,000.
"
,,
4,21,"Don't ask me how I got it.
"
,,
4,21,"I had to call in a whole bunch of favors
"
,,
4,21,"from people I've never even met.
"
,,
4,21,"So the very least you can do is just
"
,,
4,21,"rub up against... I don't know.
"
,,
4,21," Well, if you want I can...
"
,,
4,21," No, no, no. No. No. It's fine. No.
"
,,
4,21,"Whatever. Just go to
"
,,
4,21,"your wedding, man.
"
,,
4,21,"No. No, no, no.
"
,,
4,21,"Take... just get it out of here.
"
,,
4,21,"Peter, what's the matter?
"
,,
4,21,"This is a happy occasion.
"
,,
4,21,"No, it's not, Lois. It's horrible.
"
,,
4,21,"You don't know what happens
"
,,
4,21,"to a man when he gets married.
"
,,
4,21,"It's like a disease that rots
"
,,
4,21,"you from the inside out.
"
,,
4,21,"I know, Peter, but...
"
,,
4,21,"Oh, damn it.
"
,,
4,21,"I can't believe how much
"
,,
4,21,"my breasts have swollen.
"
,,
4,21,"Look out.
"
,,
4,21,"Champagne.
"
,,
4,21,"Peter, stop.
"
,,
4,21,"Oh, Lois, you're all wet.
"
,,
4,21,"Here, let me jiggle you dry.
"
,,
4,21,"Giggety-giggety. God!
"
,,
4,21,"I've made a terrible mistake!
"
,,
4,21,"Oh, my God! You blew it up!
"
,,
4,21,"You really did it.
"
,,
4,21,"Damn you all to hell!
"
,,
4,21,"Oh, God, I gotta get
"
,,
4,21,"out of this marriage.
"
,,
4,21," Cleveland, how did you get out of yours?
"
,,
4,21," You slept with my wife.
"
,,
4,21,"It's easy, Quagmire.
"
,,
4,21,"Just tell her to hit the bricks.
"
,,
4,21,"Yeah, you've gotten out
"
,,
4,21,"of commitments before.
"
,,
4,21,"Wow, that was great.
"
,,
4,21,"Sure was. See ya.
"
,,
4,21,"But you said we were
"
,,
4,21,"gonna get married.
"
,,
4,21,"No, I only said that so you'd
"
,,
4,21,"giggoogety my gashmoigin.
"
,,
4,21,"So, anyway,
"
,,
4,21,"what I'm trying to tell you is, uh...
"
,,
4,21,"some of the guys thought
"
,,
4,21,"we should get a divorce.
"
,,
4,21,"What?!
"
,,
4,21,"B- b-b-b-but I, I told them they didn't
"
,,
4,21,"know what they were talking about.
"
,,
4,21,"Good. Good.
"
,,
4,21,"'Cause if you ever left me,
"
,,
4,21,"I'd have to cut myself.
"
,,
4,21,"and then... I'd cut you.
"
,,
4,21,"I love you, Glenn.
"
,,
4,21,"I love you, too, insane woman
"
,,
4,21,"I'm having second thoughts about.
"
,,
4,21," What?!
"
,,
4,21," All right.
"
,,
4,21,"Yeah, sleep away, woman.
"
,,
4,21,"But I'm here to claim
"
,,
4,21,"what's rightfully mine.
"
,,
4,21,"Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah.
"
,,
4,21,"Oh, that's the stuff.
"
,,
4,21,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.
"
,,
4,21,"Dear God, I've got to
"
,,
4,21,"get a hold of myself.
"
,,
4,21,"Look at me, sucking pilfered
"
,,
4,21,"milk off a dirty carpet.
"
,,
4,21,"I'm as pathetic as the fat
"
,,
4,21,"man when he tries to read.
"
,,
4,21," Hey, Lois, what's this word?
"
,,
4,21," Evel.
"
,,
4,21," And this one?
"
,,
4,21," Knievel.
"
,,
4,21," And this one.
"
,,
4,21," Was.
"
,,
4,21," And this one.
"
,,
4,21," Born.
"
,,
4,21," And this one.
"
,,
4,21," In.
"
,,
4,21," And this one.
"
,,
4,21," Montana.
"
,,
4,21,"Oh, hey, Lois. Did you know that
"
,,
4,21,"Evel Knievel was born in Montana?
"
,,
4,21,"You didn't tell her?
"
,,
4,21,"Look, I told you,
"
,,
4,21,"she was gonna kill herself.
"
,,
4,21," What was I supposed to do?
"
,,
4,21," Let her.
"
,,
4,21,"No, that's not funny.
"
,,
4,21,"Wait a second. We know she's
"
,,
4,21,"gonna be upset if you dump her,
"
,,
4,21,"but if something happened
"
,,
4,21,"that was out of your control...
"
,,
4,21," What do you mean?
"
,,
4,21," I mean, we're gonna fake your death.
"
,,
4,21,"All right, fellas, I think we did it.
"
,,
4,21,"This may be the most absolutely perfect
"
,,
4,21,"fake death in the history of fake deaths.
"
,,
4,21," What do you guys want?
"
,,
4,21," Joan. Um...
"
,,
4,21,"You mind if we come in?
"
,,
4,21,"There's, um...
"
,,
4,21,"there's been an accident.
"
,,
4,21,"This is, uh, not going to be easy,
"
,,
4,21,"but, um, it's something you should see.
"
,,
4,21,"So, anyway, here's Quagmire
"
,,
4,21,"walking through the park
"
,,
4,21,"minding his own business. I just happened
"
,,
4,21,"to be there with my video camera,
"
,,
4,21,"when a ninja shows up!
"
,,
4,21,"And then a Nazi came!
"
,,
4,21,"And then an evil pots-and-pans robot.
"
,,
4,21,"Destroy.
"
,,
4,21,"Destroy.
"
,,
4,21,"I imagine you're probably wondering
"
,,
4,21,"what happened to the body.
"
,,
4,21,"Well, we thought of that.
"
,,
4,21,"Oh, no, Quagmire's dead.
"
,,
4,21,"Wait. We might still be able to save...
"
,,
4,21,"Oh, no...
"
,,
4,21,"We are so, so sorry for your loss.
"
,,
4,21,"Is this a joke?
"
,,
4,21,"I wish it were, Joan.
"
,,
4,21,"I wish it were a joke.
"
,,
4,21,"But these things happen, you know?
"
,,
4,21,"You go for a walk in the park one
"
,,
4,21,"day and wheel chair ninjas and Nazis
"
,,
4,21,"and pots-and-pans robots show up to kill
"
,,
4,21,"you and dinosaurs show up to eat the remains.
"
,,
4,21," You've seen the news.
"
,,
4,21," You're not fooling anyone.
"
,,
4,21,"All right, fellows, Plan B.
"
,,
4,21,"Plan B, Quagmire.
"
,,
4,21,"Hi, honey, I'm home!
"
,,
4,21,"Heart attack.
"
,,
4,21,"Glenn! Sweetheart!
"
,,
4,21," Is he all right?
"
,,
4,21," No, he's dead.
"
,,
4,21," I can tell. I'm a cop.
"
,,
4,21," Oh, my God.
"
,,
4,21,"Are you sure?
"
,,
4,21,"You know what'll prove it? When
"
,,
4,21,"people die, they void their bowels.
"
,,
4,21,"I said, when people die,
"
,,
4,21,"they void their bowels.
"
,,
4,21,"What a jackass.
"
,,
4,21," Well, you look a lot better.
"
,,
4,21," I did it, Brian.
"
,,
4,21,"Through sheer force of will,
"
,,
4,21,"I kicked my addiction to breast milk.
"
,,
4,21,"I just had to find a way to
"
,,
4,21,"make breasts seem repulsive.
"
,,
4,21," Yeah? How'd you do that?
"
,,
4,21," I watched In the Cut.
"
,,
4,21,"Meg Ryan, topless.
"
,,
4,21,"No thanks. No thanks.
"
,,
4,21,"Stewie, Mommy has a surprise for you.
"
,,
4,21,"What are you doing?
"
,,
4,21,"Well, Brian, I thought
"
,,
4,21,"I was ready to wean him,
"
,,
4,21,"but I just miss the bonding.
"
,,
4,21,"No. No! No, put me down!
"
,,
4,21,"I beg of you!
"
,,
4,21,"I just kicked the stuff.
"
,,
4,21,"Damn you!
"
,,
4,21,"You sick, twisted...
"
,,
4,21,"I hate you.
"
,,
4,21,"I love it.
"
,,
4,21,"I will kill you!
"
,,
4,21,"You sure Quagmire's okay in there?
"
,,
4,21,"No problem. He's got
"
,,
4,21,"half an hour of oxygen.
"
,,
4,21,"We'll sneak back
"
,,
4,21,"later and dig him up.
"
,,
4,21,"Sorry I'm late. I had a meeting
"
,,
4,21,"over at NBC about Joey.
"
,,
4,21,"Death? What are you doing here?
"
,,
4,21,"Nobody's dying today.
"
,,
4,21,"Not according to my paperwork.
"
,,
4,21,"Says here your buddy Quagmire
"
,,
4,21,"died of a heart attack.
"
,,
4,21,"I gotta tell you, I always thought
"
,,
4,21,"it'd be rectal trauma.
"
,,
4,21,"Whoa, whoa, whoa.
"
,,
4,21,"What the hell are you doing?
"
,,
4,21,"Well, Mayor West is afraid of zombies,
"
,,
4,21,"so the city says all caskets
"
,,
4,21,"must been cased in concrete.
"
,,
4,21,"You'll thank me when
"
,,
4,21,"no one eats our brains.
"
,,
4,21,"You'll thank me.
"
,,
4,21,"Hold it! Stop the funeral!
"
,,
4,21,"Quagmire's not really dead.
"
,,
4,21,"Zombie!
"
,,
4,21,"Glenn! I thought I'd lost you!
"
,,
4,21,"Sorry, Mr. Quagmire, but I still need
"
,,
4,21,"a body to take back with me, so...
"
,,
4,21,"No! You can't take him!
"
,,
4,21,"Uh... You know, um...
"
,,
4,21,"This is probably not cool.
"
,,
4,21,"Just throwing it out there.
"
,,
4,21," She was suicidal.
"
,,
4,21," She was?
"
,,
4,21," Yeah, absolutely.
"
,,
4,21," I have heard that, too.
"
,,
4,21," And her last name was Quagmire.
"
,,
4,21," Well, good enough for me.
"
,,
4,21,"I gotta go. I got tickets
"
,,
4,21,"to Celine Dion.
"
,,
4,21,"I'm not gonna kill her. I'm just
"
,,
4,21,"gonna watch her die on her own.
"
,,
4,21,"Anyone? Anyone?
"
,,
4,21,"It's good to have you back, Quagmire.
"
,,
4,21,"It's good to be back, Peter.
"
,,
4,21,"Hey, Death?
"
,,
4,21,"Can you leave that body here
"
,,
4,21,"for another five minutes?
"
,,
4,21,"That's Quagmire.

,,
4,22,"Oh, God, I hope you're not pregnant.
"
,,
4,22,"We can't afford another kid.
"
,,
4,22,"We already got Chris, Stewie,
"
,,
4,22,"Richie, Joanie, Greg, Marcia,
"
,,
4,22,"Bobby, Jan, Mike Seaver, Carol Seaver,
"
,,
4,22,"Boner, Urkel, Mr. Furley...
"
,,
4,22,"Peter, those aren't your kids.
"
,,
4,22,"That's the Nick At Nite lineup.
"
,,
4,22,"Blanka, Zangief,
"
,,
4,22,"Chun-Li, Guile, E. Honda...
"
,,
4,22," That's Street Fighter.
"
,,
4,22," Red, blue, green.
"
,,
4,22,"Those are colors.
"
,,
4,22,"God, I can't believe we
"
,,
4,22,"weren't more careful.
"
,,
4,22,"This probably happened that
"
,,
4,22,"night we tried role-playing.
"
,,
4,22,"Oh, I need a spanking.
"
,,
4,22,"I'm a bad, bad girl.
"
,,
4,22,"I'm a paladin with 18 charisma
"
,,
4,22,"and 97 hit points.
"
,,
4,22,"I can use my helm of disintegration,
"
,,
4,22,"and do One-D-Four damage as my half-elf
"
,,
4,22,"mage wields his plus five holy avenger.
"
,,
4,22,"Paladins can't use the
"
,,
4,22,"helm of disintegration.
"
,,
4,22,"Okay.
"
,,
4,22,"Then I'm a black guy.
"
,,
4,22,"Oh, thank God it's negative.
"
,,
4,22,"Dodged a bullet there, huh?
"
,,
4,22,"Although, I got to tell you,
"
,,
4,22,"I was, uh, kind of getting used
"
,,
4,22,"to the idea of having a
"
,,
4,22,"little brother or sister.
"
,,
4,22,"Peter, we can't risk
"
,,
4,22,"these things anymore.
"
,,
4,22,"You're absolutely right.
"
,,
4,22,"Lois, you're getting your tubes tied.
"
,,
4,22,"Why should I get my tubes tied?
"
,,
4,22,"You should get a vasectomy.
"
,,
4,22,"First of all, I don't know what that is,
"
,,
4,22,"and second of all, no freaking way.
"
,,
4,22,"Peter, it's the male equivalent
"
,,
4,22,"of a woman getting her tube's tied,
"
,,
4,22,"except it's actually a
"
,,
4,22,"lot quicker and safer.
"
,,
4,22,"Let these guys explain.
"
,,
4,22," You're half a man</i>
"
,,
4,22,"twisted up your garden hose?</i>
"
,,
4,22,"Well, I'm starting to get the picture,
"
,,
4,22,"but how's it done?
"
,,
4,22," Isolate the vas, and then you</i>
"
,,
4,22," Then you snip the fibrous tissue</i>
"
,,
4,22,"have to wear a</i>
"
,,
4,22,"beams under her ribbed white cotton T-shirt</i>
"
,,
4,22,"you for checking her out</i>
"
,,
4,22,"that if you don't want attention?</i>
"
,,
4,22,"shouldn't think that way</i>
"
,,
4,22,"meeting you all had to go to</i>
"
,,
4,22,"lawyer running the seminar had a huge rack</i>
"
,,
4,22,"who has to talk about that kind of stuff</i>
"
,,
4,22,"definition of the word</i>
"
,,
4,22," Say good-bye to manhood</i>
"
,,
4,22," Say good-bye to babies</i>
"
,,
4,22," Say good-bye to kids like Meg</i>
"
,,
4,22,"Vacuum out your sack.
"
,,
4,22,"Well, guys, my vasectomy is tomorrow.
"
,,
4,22,"You poor bastard.
"
,,
4,22,"After all, sex is pointless
"
,,
4,22,"without potency.
"
,,
4,22,"That's right. You take the venom out
"
,,
4,22,"of a cobra, and what have you got?
"
,,
4,22,"You got a...
"
,,
4,22,"a belt.
"
,,
4,22,"It's not that big a deal.
"
,,
4,22,"A bunch of the guys on the
"
,,
4,22,"force have had vasectomies,
"
,,
4,22,"and their lives haven't changed at all.
"
,,
4,22," Would you ever have one?
"
,,
4,22," Never!
"
,,
4,22,"Well, yeah, but what if me and Lois do end
"
,,
4,22,"up wanting another baby? It'll be too late.
"
,,
4,22,"You could freeze some of your
"
,,
4,22,"sperm at the sperm bank just in case.
"
,,
4,22,"I don't know, Cleveland. It didn't work
"
,,
4,22,"out so great that time I froze my nuts.
"
,,
4,22,"No! No!
"
,,
4,22,"Bad squirrel!
"
,,
4,22,"Those are my nuts!
"
,,
4,22,"My nuts!
"
,,
4,22,"Ah, you're just a hungry
"
,,
4,22,"little fellow, aren't you?
"
,,
4,22,"But those are my nuts.
"
,,
4,22,"No! Oh, God, no!
"
,,
4,22,"My nuts! My nuts!
"
,,
4,22," Hey, Brian, you want to play tag?
"
,,
4,22," No.
"
,,
4,22," Freeze tag?
"
,,
4,22," No.
"
,,
4,22," TV tag?
"
,,
4,22," No.
"
,,
4,22,"If I can get some guys, you
"
,,
4,22,"want to play Red Rover?
"
,,
4,22,"No. Maybe.
"
,,
4,22,"You get the guys first,
"
,,
4,22,"we'll talk about it.
"
,,
4,22,"No! Junglegym mine!
"
,,
4,22,"Hey, where'd you get
"
,,
4,22,"the Pete Rose haircut?
"
,,
4,22,"Anyone else want to feel
"
,,
4,22,"my Weebok in their grapes?
"
,,
4,22,"Then you'll all do as I say!
"
,,
4,22," Hi.
"
,,
4,22," Well, hello there.
"
,,
4,22,"Yes, that's right, cry. Cry like Sauron
"
,,
4,22,"when he lost his contact lens.
"
,,
4,22,"Nobody move, nobody move.
"
,,
4,22,"D- Does-Does anybody see it?
"
,,
4,22,"It might be stuck to a tree or a rock.
"
,,
4,22,"A nyone?
"
,,
4,22,"Oh, I am so grounded.
"
,,
4,22,"Hi, there. Peter Griffin.
"
,,
4,22,"I've, uh, got an appointment to, uh,
"
,,
4,22,"banish a white Russian from my Kremlin.
"
,,
4,22,"Well, we don't have empty rooms
"
,,
4,22,"right now, but if you'll have a seat...
"
,,
4,22,"Yeah. Uh, I kind of, uh, warmed myself
"
,,
4,22,"up in the car, if you catch my drift.
"
,,
4,22," I could put you in the storage freezer.
"
,,
4,22," That'll work.
"
,,
4,22,"Nurse, I've got a splinter.
"
,,
4,22,"Just come out whenever you're done.
"
,,
4,22,"Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
"
,,
4,22,"Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
"
,,
4,22,"Oh, God, I...
"
,,
4,22,"I think I feel them moving.
"
,,
4,22,"Hi. My partner and I want to have a baby.
"
,,
4,22,"We'd like a vial of sperm and an applicator
"
,,
4,22,"that looks like Jody Foster's knuckles.
"
,,
4,22,"Certainly. Let me just go to the freezer.
"
,,
4,22,"Mr. Griffin, you were in
"
,,
4,22,"there an awfully long time.
"
,,
4,22," Are you all right?
"
,,
4,22," Yup, yup, fine, fine.
"
,,
4,22,"And, uh, just so you know, everything in there
"
,,
4,22,"is exactly the way it was when I went in.
"
,,
4,22,"There is absolutely zero chance
"
,,
4,22,"that I spilled all the jars and had
"
,,
4,22,"to refill them with my own sperm.
"
,,
4,22,"Zero chance.
"
,,
4,22,"It's a boy!
"
,,
4,22,"Victory shall be mine!
"
,,
4,22,"and Sylvester Stallone in...</i>
"
,,
4,22,"Peter, we have to talk.
"
,,
4,22,"We haven't had sex since your vasectomy.
"
,,
4,22,"Ah, I just don't feel like it, Lois,
"
,,
4,22,"seeing as how I'm not a real man anymore.
"
,,
4,22,"Honey, it was just a simple operation.
"
,,
4,22,"It's no reason to give
"
,,
4,22,"up on your sex life.
"
,,
4,22,"I don't know, Lois.
"
,,
4,22,"I'm just not feeling it anymore.
"
,,
4,22,"Besides, it gives me
"
,,
4,22,"time to try new things.
"
,,
4,22,"Like that time I tried
"
,,
4,22,"wearing adult diapers.
"
,,
4,22,"Hey, Lois. Hey, kids.
"
,,
4,22,"Oh, boy, that smells delicious.
"
,,
4,22,"You know, I'd love to stay
"
,,
4,22,"and eat with you, but,
"
,,
4,22,"I got to go meet Cleveland,
"
,,
4,22,"Joe and Quagmire down at...
"
,,
4,22,"...the bar, so, uh, just put my dinner
"
,,
4,22,"in the fridge, and I'll heat it up later.
"
,,
4,22,"Love ya'.
"
,,
4,22,"You, go get me an ice cream!
"
,,
4,22,"You, clear the slide.
"
,,
4,22,"I'm going down in five minutes.
"
,,
4,22,"You, did you get me my Cheese Whiz, boy?
"
,,
4,22,"You're my boyfriend.
"
,,
4,22,"Yes, dear, of course I am.
"
,,
4,22,"Now where's Lloyd with our Fun Dip?
"
,,
4,22,"Good God, running an
"
,,
4,22,"empire is harder than
"
,,
4,22,"finding diversity in the
"
,,
4,22,"Abercrombie & Fitchcatalogue.
"
,,
4,22," There he is! There he is right there.
"
,,
4,22," Ah! Found him!
"
,,
4,22,"Oh, that was a tricky one.
"
,,
4,22,"What the deuce is all the commotion?
"
,,
4,22,"All right! Out of my way! Move aside!
"
,,
4,22,"What the hell is so bloody fascinating?
"
,,
4,22,"You!
"
,,
4,22,"Well, well, well.
"
,,
4,22,"If it isn't my half-brother, Stewie!
"
,,
4,22,"Bertram! I haven't seen you since
"
,,
4,22,"our microscopic encounter.
"
,,
4,22,"How the deuce did you get
"
,,
4,22,"out of Peter's testicles?
"
,,
4,22," He donated sperm.
"
,,
4,22," Gross.
"
,,
4,22,"Well, I don't mean to be a discourteous
"
,,
4,22,"host, but this is my playground.
"
,,
4,22," I rule this territory.
"
,,
4,22," My, my.
"
,,
4,22,"What an amusingly misguided view.
"
,,
4,22,"Very well, then. You leave me
"
,,
4,22,"no choice but to declare war.
"
,,
4,22,"So be it. I'll do to you what
"
,,
4,22,"B.C. does to comedy on a daily basis.
"
,,
4,22,"Hey, boys, you having a midnight snack?
"
,,
4,22,"I'm just gonna grab something,
"
,,
4,22,"too, and go back to bed.
"
,,
4,22,"Alone. Again.
"
,,
4,22,"Night.
"
,,
4,22,"You know, Lois has gotten kind of fat
"
,,
4,22,"since you guys stopped having sex.
"
,,
4,22,"It might be time to, uh...
"
,,
4,22,"you know...
"
,,
4,22,"have some sex.
"
,,
4,22,"You know, at first, I didn't want to do it
"
,,
4,22,"'cause of the vasectomy, but now it's just...
"
,,
4,22,"I mean, look at her.
"
,,
4,22,"She's got elbow cleavage.
"
,,
4,22,"You know, that little wrinkle that fat people
"
,,
4,22,"get on their elbows that looks like a schwa?
"
,,
4,22,"I mean, you wouldn't have
"
,,
4,22,"sex with her, would you?
"
,,
4,22," Oh, yeah, I would.
"
,,
4,22," Really?
"
,,
4,22,"Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, I would do everything
"
,,
4,22,"to her. I don't care what she looks like.
"
,,
4,22," I would wreck that chick.
"
,,
4,22," Well, you are a trooper.
"
,,
4,22,"Sorry, fat wife coming through.
"
,,
4,22,"Sorry, sorry, excuse me, fat wife.
"
,,
4,22,"Oh, hold on a sec.
"
,,
4,22," All right, bring her through.
"
,,
4,22," Peter, stop it.
"
,,
4,22,"For God's sakes, you're embarrassing me.
"
,,
4,22,"Not as embarrassed as I was when
"
,,
4,22,"I got that job entertaining prison inmates.
"
,,
4,22,"Do it again, Griffin.
"
,,
4,22," Come on, I just did it like five...
"
,,
4,22," Do it!
"
,,
4,22,"My milkshake brings all the boys
"
,,
4,22,"to the yard and they're, like...
"
,,
4,22,"it's better than yours, damn right,
"
,,
4,22,"it's better than yours I could
"
,,
4,22,"teach you, but I'd have to charge.
"
,,
4,22,"Look, honey, with all due respect,
"
,,
4,22,"you've gained some weight recently.
"
,,
4,22,"It's five pounds at the most.
"
,,
4,22,"It's not a big deal.
"
,,
4,22,"It's a slippery slope, Lois.
"
,,
4,22,"You start with five pounds,
"
,,
4,22,"and then one day, boom,
"
,,
4,22,"you wake up, and you're on The Practice
"
,,
4,22,"with sixteen rings in your ear.
"
,,
4,22,"You're one to talk.
"
,,
4,22,"Look how fat you are.
"
,,
4,22,"Lois, men aren't fat.
"
,,
4,22,"Only fat women are fat.
"
,,
4,22,"Now, if you'll excuse me i have to
"
,,
4,22,"go warn the chef that you've arrived.
"
,,
4,22,"He wants fat?
"
,,
4,22,"I'll show him fat.
"
,,
4,22,"The only reason I'm eating
"
,,
4,22,"anyway is because i hate him.
"
,,
4,22,"He won't touch me.
"
,,
4,22,"Do you think I'm fat?
"
,,
4,22," Only if you think I'm a serial killer.
"
,,
4,22," What?
"
,,
4,22,"Nothing.
"
,,
4,22,"Attention, all hands!
"
,,
4,22,"We're going to launch a massive air
"
,,
4,22,"strike against Bertram and his army.
"
,,
4,22,"Behold the armada!
"
,,
4,22,"It's quite simple, actually.
"
,,
4,22,"You press the smiling duck to take off,
"
,,
4,22,"the cow with the bow tie to fire weapons,
"
,,
4,22,"and the clown face is
"
,,
4,22,"just a clown face, enjoy it.
"
,,
4,22,"Now, battle stations, everyone!
"
,,
4,22,"At my signal...
"
,,
4,22,"Unleash hell.
"
,,
4,22,"What took you so long?
"
,,
4,22,"What took you so ugly?
"
,,
4,22," Well, now what?
"
,,
4,22," Want to play 20 Questions?
"
,,
4,22," Sure, uh, is it a man?
"
,,
4,22," Yes.
"
,,
4,22," Is he famous?
"
,,
4,22," Yes.
"
,,
4,22," Is he under 40?
"
,,
4,22," No.
"
,,
4,22," Over 40?
"
,,
4,22," Yes.
"
,,
4,22," On television?
"
,,
4,22," Yes.
"
,,
4,22," On television now.
"
,,
4,22," No.
"
,,
4,22," In the past 20 years?
"
,,
4,22," Yes.
"
,,
4,22," Is it Richard Mulligan?
"
,,
4,22," Yes!
"
,,
4,22,"Even till now we've been
"
,,
4,22,"fighting Bertram on his terms.
"
,,
4,22,"Whoa. Easy, easy, girl.
"
,,
4,22,"Easy, easy, easy.
"
,,
4,22,"But I propose an invasion.
"
,,
4,22,"We've got to fight him
"
,,
4,22,"over there by the swing set,
"
,,
4,22,"so we don't have to fight
"
,,
4,22,"him here at the sandbox.
"
,,
4,22,"Stewie.
"
,,
4,22,"What's this?
"
,,
4,22,"A letter of surrender.
"
,,
4,22,"We did it!
"
,,
4,22,"Whew. It's a good thing, too, because
"
,,
4,22,"I really didn't have an exit strategy.
"
,,
4,22,"Yay, Stewie.
"
,,
4,22,"Oh, thank you, darling, I...
"
,,
4,22,"What is this, makeup?
"
,,
4,22,"Are you wearing makeup?
"
,,
4,22,"Chicken pox.
"
,,
4,22,"Damn you, Bertram, I thought
"
,,
4,22,"we called no biological warfare!
"
,,
4,22,"You swore on the seesaw!
"
,,
4,22,"Stewie, there you are.
"
,,
4,22,"Oh, my God. Your face.
"
,,
4,22,"Oh, sweetie, you got the chicken pox.
"
,,
4,22," Come on, we got to get you out of here.
"
,,
4,22," No.
"
,,
4,22,"No, damn you! I've go
"
,,
4,22,"finish what I started!
"
,,
4,22,"No... My God, do you put on weight?
"
,,
4,22,"You're like one of those
"
,,
4,22,"Memory Foam mattresses.
"
,,
4,22,"Look, there's my face.
"
,,
4,22,"Here you go, sweetie.
"
,,
4,22,"A couple more oatmeal
"
,,
4,22,"baths and you'll be all better.
"
,,
4,22,"No need to clean up when I'm done.
"
,,
4,22,"You'll probably just slice a couple of
"
,,
4,22,"bananas in here and chow down, huh, porky?
"
,,
4,22,"So what happened with
"
,,
4,22,"that kid on the playground?
"
,,
4,22,"He won this round, Brian,
"
,,
4,22,"but I'm going back tomorrow.
"
,,
4,22,"And when I've carried out my plan,
"
,,
4,22,"he won't know what hit him.
"
,,
4,22,"Like that baseball team
"
,,
4,22,"that Peter coached.
"
,,
4,22,"Well, kids, just when I thought we'd
"
,,
4,22,"never find and assistant coach,
"
,,
4,22,"I ran into this drifter hanging out near
"
,,
4,22,"the elementary school playground.
"
,,
4,22,"He's got a clown costume in his trunk,
"
,,
4,22,"so we know he's good with kids,
"
,,
4,22,"and pictures of boys in their underwear,
"
,,
4,22,"so he's probably had some medical training.
"
,,
4,22,"Well, I'm going to take off while he fits you
"
,,
4,22,"for cups in that windowless supply shed.
"
,,
4,22,"See ya.

4,22,"Lois, you weigh a ton. Get off me.
"
,,
4,22," I'm trying.
"
,,
4,22," Try harder.
"
,,
4,22," Ow! Lois, that hurts!
"
,,
4,22," Peter, if you'll just stop for one second...
"
,,
4,22,"Peter, are we having sex?
"
,,
4,22,"Uh, let's check. Uh, just,
"
,,
4,22,"lift up that fold right there.
"
,,
4,22,"Uh... yeah.
"
,,
4,22,"Lois, last night was amazing!
"
,,
4,22,"It was, wasn't it?
"
,,
4,22,"Fat sex is the hottest
"
,,
4,22,"sex we've ever had.
"
,,
4,22,"There were so many boobs, I didn't know whose
"
,,
4,22,"boobs I was grabbing, your boobs or my boobs.
"
,,
4,22,"I know, it was amazing.
"
,,
4,22,"Much better than that night you
"
,,
4,22,"pretended your penis was Danny Aiello.
"
,,
4,22,"Oh. That is so interesting, Danny Aiello.
"
,,
4,22,"You've got the best Spike Lee stories.
"
,,
4,22,"What's that?
"
,,
4,22,"You want to meet my wife?
"
,,
4,22," Peter, stop it.
"
,,
4,22," Lois, just say hello.
"
,,
4,22,"You're embarrassing me
"
,,
4,22,"in front of Danny Aiello.
"
,,
4,22,"Now come here, my fat concubine.
"
,,
4,22,"Peter, I'm not even hungry.
"
,,
4,22,"I want you bigger.
"
,,
4,22,"I want you fatter.
"
,,
4,22,"It will please me.
"
,,
4,22,"With Stewart out of the picture, this
"
,,
4,22,"whole playground is under my control.
"
,,
4,22,"I sense something.
"
,,
4,22,"A presence I've not felt since...
"
,,
4,22,"Stewie, you're alive!
"
,,
4,22,"Yes, Bertram, I'm alive,
"
,,
4,22,"and I think you'll find all your
"
,,
4,22,"guards quite incapacitated.
"
,,
4,22,"You have an annoying habit of
"
,,
4,22,"turning up where you're not welcome.
"
,,
4,22,"Well, when I'm done with you, you're going to
"
,,
4,22,"hate me more that the other vowels hate ""Y.""
"
,,
4,22,"If you'll turn to page 34 of your blue books,
"
,,
4,22,"you'll see our projections for next quarter,
"
,,
4,22,"Okay. Okay. All right.
"
,,
4,22,"You know what?
"
,,
4,22,"I'm in a meeting. I'll call you back.
"
,,
4,22,"Well, well, well, look who
"
,,
4,22,"decided to show up.
"
,,
4,22,"So, what are we talking about here?
"
,,
4,22," Well, before you...
"
,,
4,22," I'm sorry...
"
,,
4,22,"F! What's up?
"
,,
4,22,"No, no, I can talk.
"
,,
4,22,"En garde!
"
,,
4,22,"Any last words?
"
,,
4,22,"You wouldn't kill me...
"
,,
4,22,"Would you?
"
,,
4,22,"Thanks for helping me
"
,,
4,22,"dig this hole, Mr Moltisanti.
"
,,
4,22,"Hey, no problem, Stewie.
"
,,
4,22,"This can be a pain in the ass when
"
,,
4,22,"you got to do it all by yourself.
"
,,
4,22,"Yeah, you're telling me.
"
,,
4,22,"All right, go ahead and drop it in.
"
,,
4,22,"Oh, boy, that's going to be beautiful
"
,,
4,22,"when it reaches adulthood.
"
,,
4,22,"Yeah, I love plants.
"
,,
4,22,"So what happened with that kid
"
,,
4,22,"you were telling me about?
"
,,
4,22," Oh, he admitted defeat and ran off.
"
,,
4,22," What a mook.
"
,,
4,22,"Oh, Peter, I love you so much.
"
,,
4,22,"Oh, Lois, I have no idea if we're doing it
"
,,
4,22,"of if that's just the back of your knee,
"
,,
4,22,"but either way it feels so good.
"
,,
4,22,"Ow. Peter, you're on my arm. It hurts.
"
,,
4,22,"My chest hurts, too.
"
,,
4,22,"Oh, my God, Peter...
"
,,
4,22,"I think I'm having a heart attack.
"
,,
4,22," Me, too, sweetie, me, too.
"
,,
4,22," No, Peter, I'm really having a heart attack.
"
,,
4,22,"Oh, my God, you're serious?
"
,,
4,22,"We should get you to the hospital.
"
,,
4,22,"All right, hold-hold on a sec...
"
,,
4,22,"All right, almost done, almost done...
"
,,
4,22," Peter!
"
,,
4,22," Almost done, almost done, almost done.
"
,,
4,22,"Okay, let's go.
"
,,
4,22,"Well, it was a tough job removing all
"
,,
4,22,"that fat to get to your heart, Mrs Griffin,
"
,,
4,22,"but you came through it beautifully.
"
,,
4,22,"Honey, I'm sorry I tried to make
"
,,
4,22,"you into something you're not.
"
,,
4,22,"I love you no matter what size you are.
"
,,
4,22,"Although, I gotta admit, I'm gonna miss
"
,,
4,22,"eating cereal out of the dimples on your ass.
"
,,
4,22,"Well, Mrs. Griffin, you rest up for
"
,,
4,22,"a few days and you'll be just fine.
"
,,
4,22,"Thank you, Doctor.
"
,,
4,22,"I realize now that eating is not
"
,,
4,22,"the way to solve my problems.
"
,,
4,22," You hear that, Meg?
"
,,
4,22," For your information, Mom.
"
,,
4,22,"I don't eat to solve my problems.
"
,,
4,22,"I cut myself.
"
,,
4,22,"Is that better?
"
,,
4,22,"Chris, we all love your hat.
"
,,
4,22,"Thanks, Mom.
"
,,
4,22,"Hey, Doc, what did you
"
,,
4,22,"do with my Mom's fat?
"
,,
4,22,"Oh, it's right here in
"
,,
4,22,"this storage closet.
"
,,
4,22,"It's exactly what it looks like.

"

4,23,"drug dealers do to you?
"
,,
4,23,"Oh, they took my chest
"

4,23,"out and threw it over there.
"
,,
4,23,"Then they pulled my legs out
"

4,23,"and threw them over there.
"

4,23,"Brian, you're still watching TV?
"
,,
4,23,"God, you've been sitting
"

4,23,"there since I left.
"
,,
4,23,"I spent all morning watching

"

4,23,"I don't know what
"

4,23,"a ""Hollaback Girl"" is,

4,23,"Hey, can you hand me the remote?
"

4,23,"You know, you've been laying
"

4,23,"around the house a lot lately.

"
,,
4,23,"I work at Burger King making
"

"

4,23,"Wow, congratulations, Meg.
"
,,
4,23,"Yeah, it was a really tough

4,23,"interview, but I totally nailed it.
"
,,
4,23,"All right, Meg, we're going to
"
,,
4,23,"start with a little word association.
"
,,
4,23,"I'll say a word and you say

"

4,23,"You see, Brian, Meg has a job.
"

4,23,"Hey, Meg, if you're working for the
"

4,23,"mayor, you know what that means?
"

4,23,"Even you're doing better than Brian.
"

4,23,"Hey, everybody, Brian's the new Meg.
"
,,
4,23,"Brian's the new Meg!
"
,,
4,23,"Brian's the new Meg!
"
,,
4,23," Yeah, you're the new me.
"
,,
4,23," Shut up, Meg.
"
,,
4,23,"Let's go, kids.
"
,,
4,23,"Time for school.
"
,,
4,23,"Lois, I don't want to
"
,,
4,23,"ruin your morning, but...
"
,,
4,23,"I flushed a diaper and
"
,,
4,23,"it's a mess up there.
"
,,
4,23,"Brian, what is this?
"
,,
4,23,"You're driving a cab?
"
,,
4,23,"Well, Lois, I realized you were right.
"
,,
4,23,"I mean, it's time I went out
"
,,
4,23,"and got a job,
"
,,
4,23,"for God's sakes, I'm seven years old.
"
,,
4,23,"Seven? That's not bad.
"
,,
4,23,"You know, Todd was 15 when he died.
"
,,
4,23,"The dog we had before you.
"
,,
4,23,"Hey, Peter, did you call me?
"
,,
4,23,"Yeah, I thought we'd
"
,,
4,23,"go to the park, Todd.
"
,,
4,23,"Oh, you're not taking
"
,,
4,23,"me to the vet, are you?
"
,,
4,23,"No, no, just a nice day at the park.
"
,,
4,23,"I'm a little worried that you're
"
,,
4,23,"going to have me put down.
"
,,
4,23,"I know there's been some concern
"
,,
4,23,"about my sphincter's low shutter speed.
"
,,
4,23,"No, no, we're just
"
,,
4,23,"going to the park, Todd.
"
,,
4,23,"Oh, okay, well,
"
,,
4,23,"I'll enjoy the ride, then.
"
,,
4,23,"Around the park one
"
,,
4,23,"more time, Bitterman.
"
,,
4,23,"Peter, I'm not your chauffeur.
"
,,
4,23,"Not for long with that
"
,,
4,23,"attitude, Bitterman.
"
,,
4,23,"Ah, this is living, Bitterman.
"
,,
4,23,"This set of wheels is even better than
"
,,
4,23,"those talking cars on that commercial.
"
,,
4,23,"Hey, how you doing there?
"
,,
4,23,"Listen, uh...
"
,,
4,23,"I couldn't help but notice you
"
,,
4,23,"across the parking lot and, uh...
"
,,
4,23,"you know, you're very
"
,,
4,23,"attractive and, uh...
"
,,
4,23,"You want to go behind
"
,,
4,23,"the Applebee's and do it?
"
,,
4,23,"Huh? You want to just go have some
"
,,
4,23,"dirty, stupid, insane parking lot sex?
"
,,
4,23,"Chuck, it's me, Morty.
"
,,
4,23,"Yeah, 'cause we could...
"
,,
4,23,"What?!
"
,,
4,23,"Yeah, they had me painted.
"
,,
4,23,"Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed.
"
,,
4,23," Hey, how do you think I feel?
"
,,
4,23," No, no, that, too, but...
"
,,
4,23," It's not all about you, you know.
"
,,
4,23," Morty...
"
,,
4,23," Oh, my God, what are you doing?
"
,,
4,23," Think I was like a birthday present...
"
,,
4,23," for the kid or something like that.
"
,,
4,23," Oh, my god. Look at you.
"
,,
4,23," You're, you're hot.
"
,,
4,23," I know.
"
,,
4,23,"You know what I would've done to you back
"
,,
4,23,"there? Why didn't you say something earlier?
"
,,
4,23,"I said all that stuff. God!
"
,,
4,23,"Let's not rule anything out.
"
,,
4,23," Hey, look, there's Lois.
"
,,
4,23," Yeah. Hey, honk the horn.
"
,,
4,23,"Ah, hi, Peter.
"
,,
4,23," Ram her.
"
,,
4,23," What?
"
,,
4,23,"I said ram her!
"
,,
4,23,"What the hell?!
"
,,
4,23," Now shoot her tires out.
"
,,
4,23," What?
"
,,
4,23,"You got a gun?
"
,,
4,23,"Well, yeah. Every cabbie
"
,,
4,23,"carries a gun...
"
,,
4,23,"Give me the gun.
"
,,
4,23,"What the hell is wrong with you, Peter?!
"
,,
4,23,"You could've killed me!
"
,,
4,23,"Yeah, but I got you good, Lois.
"
,,
4,23,"Admit it. Just say it, I got you.
"
,,
4,23,"Oh, all right, you got me.
"
,,
4,23,"I told you.
"
,,
4,23,"Oh, no, what happened here?
"
,,
4,23,"Oh, we got into a little
"
,,
4,23,"accident. It's all right.
"
,,
4,23,"Oh, no.
"
,,
4,23,"Well, I guess accidents happen
"
,,
4,23,"when you least expect them.
"
,,
4,23,"That how come they
"
,,
4,23,"call them accidents.
"
,,
4,23,"Oh, look, you got the community
"
,,
4,23,"events corkboard wedged in your grill.
"
,,
4,23,"There, that's better.
"
,,
4,23,"Don't y'all forget to sign up for the
"
,,
4,23,"Quahog community talent show.
"
,,
4,23,"Talent show?
"
,,
4,23,"Oh, Peter, that could be fun.
"
,,
4,23," Do you think we have a chance at winning?
"
,,
4,23," Absolutely. I love being around the stage.
"
,,
4,23,"Except for that time we went
"
,,
4,23,"to see Phantom of the Opera.
"
,,
4,23,"Let's see the gross half of your face!
"
,,
4,23,"Come on!
"
,,
4,23,"Let's see the gross half of your
"
,,
4,23,"face so I can get out of here.
"
,,
4,23," That nose better be piggy.
"
,,
4,23," Shut up.
"
,,
4,23,"You shut up.
"
,,
4,23,"Oh, your old guitar.
"
,,
4,23,"I haven't seen that thing in ages.
"
,,
4,23,"Well, Lois, I thought you and me
"
,,
4,23,"could do a song for the talent show.
"
,,
4,23,"It could be just like the old
"
,,
4,23,"days when we used to play.
"
,,
4,23,"You remember, Lois?
"
,,
4,23,"Remember our band: Handful of Peter?
"
,,
4,23,"Hi there, I'm Peter.
"
,,
4,23,"And this is Lois.
"
,,
4,23,"We want to talk to you about a
"
,,
4,23,"friend of ours. He's not here tonight.
"
,,
4,23,"Although, you know,
"
,,
4,23,"he's kind of here, Lois.
"
,,
4,23," You know you're right, he kind of is.
"
,,
4,23," Yeah, because he's in our hearts.
"
,,
4,23,"Uh, this is a song about that man
"
,,
4,23,"and his world that was taken from him.
"
,,
4,23,"in oh, so many ways</i>
"
,,
4,23," Oblige...</i>
"
,,
4,23,"Was drifting off to sleep</i>
"
,,
4,23,"That we hope you all will keep</i>
"
,,
4,23,"They're gone now.
"
,,
4,23,"How could this have happened?
"
,,
4,23," How?
"
,,
4,23," How?
"
,,
4,23,"Oh, I haven't thought
"
,,
4,23,"about that in years.
"
,,
4,23,"You know, it would be fun
"
,,
4,23,"to write some new songs.
"
,,
4,23,"You know what else is fun?
"
,,
4,23,"Watching Mr. Belvedere
"
,,
4,23,"without people talking so loud.
"
,,
4,23," So I was thinking we could...
"
,,
4,23," Streaks on the china!
"
,,
4,23,"Never mattered before!
"
,,
4,23,"Who cared?
"
,,
4,23,"When you drop-kicked your jacket!
"
,,
4,23,"When you came through the door!
"
,,
4,23,"No one glared!
"
,,
4,23,"Hello?
"
,,
4,23,"Hey, Lois, what's up?
"
,,
4,23,"Milk?
"
,,
4,23,"Yeah, I'll pick some up
"
,,
4,23,"at the end of my shift.
"
,,
4,23,"Oh, got to go.
"
,,
4,23,"First fare of the night.
"
,,
4,23,"I should really pick up that
"
,,
4,23,"milk now before I forget.
"
,,
4,23,"You son of a bitch!
"
,,
4,23,"Hey, Brian, you see that magazine
"
,,
4,23,"cover right there? See who's on it?
"
,,
4,23,"Yeah, that's Jessica Alba.
"
,,
4,23,"Yeah, you want to know a secret, buddy?
"
,,
4,23," What?
"
,,
4,23," I would do her.
"
,,
4,23," Really?
"
,,
4,23," Oh, yeah.
"
,,
4,23,"I just wanted you to know
"
,,
4,23,"a little bit about who I am.
"
,,
4,23,"Thanks for the milk, Carl.
"
,,
4,23,"What the hell?
"
,,
4,23,"$400?!
"
,,
4,23,"My God, this is a bigger rip-off than
"
,,
4,23,"Peter's Sounds of the Rainforest CD.
"
,,
4,23,"This will help us fall asleep, Lois.
"
,,
4,23,"of all these trees.</i>
"
,,

"
,,
4,23,"song he does that I hate?</i>
"
,,
4,23,"Meg, I'm going to lunch
"
,,
4,23,"now and I'm having pizza.
"
,,
4,23,"So if you see the Noid running around,
"
,,
4,23,"tell him if he ruins
"
,,
4,23,"my pizza's freshness,
"
,,
4,23,"I'll snap his neck.
"
,,
4,23,"Hey, Meg, I need to see the mayor
"
,,
4,23,"about this $400 parking ticket.
"
,,
4,23,"Brian, you can't just barge in here.
"
,,
4,23,"You have to make an appointment.
"
,,
4,23,"But this is flat-out extortion.
"
,,
4,23,"No, it's not.
"
,,
4,23,"Adam can charge whatever
"
,,
4,23,"he wants for a parking ticket.
"
,,
4,23,"You know, Meg, that guy's
"
,,
4,23,"been playing fast and loose
"
,,
4,23,"with his position for years now,
"
,,
4,23,"and I've had it. He's a corrupt bastard.
"
,,
4,23," That is not true.
"
,,
4,23," Yes, it is.
"
,,
4,23,"Somebody's got to stand up and
"
,,
4,23,"prove to this town that he's a crook.
"
,,
4,23,"And it looks like it has to be me.
"
,,
4,23," What was all the commotion?
"
,,
4,23," Oh, nothing, it was just...
"
,,
4,23,"Perhaps it was the Noid
"
,,

"
,,
4,23,"Oh, you know what, Brian?
"
,,
4,23,"It took me two hours to
"
,,
4,23,"spell ""hat"" with these things.
"
,,
4,23,"I finally got the ""T"" right-side-up,
"
,,
4,23,"and then you come in here...
"
,,
4,23,"You're a bastard.
"
,,
4,23,"Where are you going?
"
,,
4,23,"I'm going to expose Mayor West
"
,,
4,23,"as the corrupt politician that he is.
"
,,
4,23,"I'm on my way to meet a source
"
,,
4,23,"who won't talk to me over the phone.
"
,,
4,23,"Ooh, scandal in Quahog.
"
,,
4,23,"Count me in.
"
,,
4,23,"Thank you for coming, Deep Throat.
"
,,
4,23,"You'll understand if I don't
"
,,
4,23,"come out from the shadows.
"
,,
4,23,"My identity will be safest
"
,,
4,23,"if you never see my face.
"
,,
4,23,"Uh, okay.
"
,,
4,23,"Mayor West hasn't slept
"
,,
4,23,"at home for three nights.
"
,,
4,23,"Kermit the Frog?
"
,,
4,23,"Somebody talked! No one is safe!
"
,,
4,23,"I'm getting out of here!
"
,,
4,23,"What's his appeal?
"
,,
4,23,"that sends you right to work</i>
"
,,
4,23,"Well, that wasn't very good.
"
,,
4,23,"We're never gonna win that talent show.
"
,,
4,23,"Hey, now, Peter, you gotta remember
"
,,
4,23,"that when we used to write the old songs,
"
,,
4,23,"we had a lot of ""inspiration,"" huh?
"
,,
4,23,"You know, I think Brian may have some
"
,,
4,23,"inspiration in a cigar box under his bed.
"
,,
4,23,"Eh, I don't know, Lois.
"
,,
4,23,"I don't think this is gonna work.
"
,,
4,23,"Come on, we can't
"
,,
4,23,"give up on our goals.
"
,,
4,23,"What if Jesus had done that?
"
,,
4,23,"Why is the ironing board still out?
"
,,
4,23,"That's, that's my
"
,,
4,23,"favorite picture of Brian,
"
,,
4,23,"over there on that wall.
"
,,
4,23,"He wants to have sex with me so bad.
"
,,
4,23,"He's not,
"
,,
4,23,"he's not gonna get to.
"
,,
4,23,"All right. There he goes. Let's move.
"
,,
4,23,"I say, what are we looking for?
"
,,
4,23,"I dunno, some proof of
"
,,
4,23,"Mayor West's corruption.
"
,,
4,23,"What are you doing here, Brian?
"
,,
4,23,"Still trying to smear my boss?
"
,,
4,23,"No, no, no, I actually
"
,,
4,23,"came to my senses,
"
,,
4,23,"and realized I was out of line.
"
,,
4,23,"Uh, I'm just here to apologize.
"
,,
4,23,"Oh, and, uh...

4,23,"you're so pretty.

"
,,
4,23,"You and I know that we
"

4,23,"haven't done anything wrong.
"

4,23,"I told you that I'd wait for

"
,,
4,23,"I see.
"
,,
4,23,"Well, Meg, I'm a public figure.
"

4,23,"I'm used to the tabloids' doodie.

4,23,"It's you I'm worried about.

4,23,"I'll take the fall, no matter what.

4,23,"Good-bye, Meg.
"
,,
4,23,"I'll always value your friendship.

4,23,"I love you, Mayor Chapstick.
"
,,
4,23,"Brian? What are you doing here?
"
,,
4,23,"I, uh...
"
,,
4,23,"just wanted to give you this.
"
,,
4,23,"I don't think I'll be
"
,,
4,23,"needing it anymore.
"
,,
4,23,"I got so caught up in taking
"
,,
4,23,"down Mayor West, that I
"
,,
4,23,"just lost sight of right and wrong.
"
,,
4,23,"Thank you, Brian.
"
,,
4,23,"Well, can I give you a lift home?
"
,,
4,23,"My cab's right outside.
"
,,
4,23,"Good evening. I'm Diane Simmons,
"
,,
4,23,"and I'd like to welcome you
"
,,
4,23,"to Quahog's Fifth Annual Talent Show.
"
,,
4,23,"Let's have a round of
"
,,
4,23,"applause for our first performer.
"
,,
4,23,"like my father's moustache</i>
"
,,
4,23,"Play me off, Johnny.
"
,,
4,23,"Ah, what else be funny tonight?
"
,,
4,23,"Uh... Star Jones got married.
"
,,
4,23,"That was in the news.
"
,,
4,23,"Uh, married a black fella,
"
,,
4,23,"which is quite a surprise
"
,,
4,23,"because I'd call her quite a catch,
"
,,
4,23,"and black guys, by and large, they're
"
,,
4,23,"not so helpful on a fishing vessel.
"
,,
4,23,"Now, Portuguese, absolutely, absolutely.
"
,,
4,23,"I even had a couple of Japanese
"
,,
4,23,"guys who worked out great.
"
,,
4,23,"Thank you very much.
"
,,
4,23,"You guys have been terrific.
"
,,
4,23,"And now our final
"
,,
4,23,"performance of the night.
"
,,
4,23,"Let's hear it for: Handful of Peter.
"
,,
4,23,"Everybody's hot</i>
"
,,
4,23,"All through her</i>
"
,,
4,23,"Chick you know</i>
"
,,
4,23,"Would totally do her</i>
"
,,
4,23,"Even call her the next day</i>
"
,,
4,23,"I can't believe we
"
,,
4,23,"lost the talent show.
"
,,
4,23,"What'd we do wrong?
"
,,
4,23,"Well, Dad, I think I can
"
,,
4,23,"shed a little light on that.
"
,,
4,23,"You guys were so baked,
"
,,
4,23,"you didn't sound anywhere near
"
,,
4,23,"as good as you thought you did.
"
,,
4,23,"I was in the audience.
"
,,
4,23,"And here we thought
"
,,
4,23,"the weed was inspiring us.
"
,,
4,23,"Well, that's a popular misconception,
"
,,
4,23,"Mom and Dad, but the fact is,
"
,,
4,23,"the chief ingredient
"
,,
4,23,"in marijuana is THC,
"
,,
4,23,"a mild form of acid,
"
,,
4,23,"prolonged usage of which can cause
"
,,
4,23,"adverse effects to your sexual potency,
"
,,
4,23,"short-term memory loss and can
"
,,
4,23,"also severely damage your brain tissue
"
,,
4,23,"central nervous system
"
,,
4,23,"and basic motor skills.
"
,,
4,23,"To put it simply, Mom and Dad,
"
,,
4,23,"there's a reason
"
,,
4,23,"that they call it ""dope. ""
"
,,
4,23,"Trying to watch Mr. Belvedere.
"
,,
4,23,"So my advice to the
"
,,
4,23,"two of you would be...
"
,,
4,23,"According to our new arrival!
"
,,

,,
4,24,"Yeah, you got some serious
"
,,
4,24,"talent there, Peter.
"
,,
4,24,"Really?
"
,,
4,24,"I'm no school administrator,
"
,,
4,24,"but there's an extension program
"
,,
4,24,"going on in my trousers.
"
,,
4,24,"""And then Captain
"
,,
4,24,"Leroy Hot Dog' Zanzibar""
"
,,
4,24,"""and Gina from my work got in the
"
,,
4,24,"backseat of his really cool spaceship. ""
"
,,
4,24,"""Gina was finally wearing that
"
,,
4,24,"tank top I got her and nothing else. ""
"
,,
4,24,"""Zanzibar knew he couldn't control
"
,,
4,24,"his space horniness any longer,""
"
,,
4,24,"""and then they totally did it. ""
"
,,
4,24,"""And if I'd have been there,
"
,,
4,24,"I would've been, like,""
"
,,
4,24,"""Ah, sweet. ""
"
,,
4,24,"Eh? What do you think?
"
,,
4,24,"You certainly do paint a picture, Peter.
"
,,
4,24,"I felt like I was right
"
,,
4,24,"there on planet Niptune.
"
,,
4,24,"You're not the only one. Everyone
"
,,
4,24,"down at the bar wanted a copy.
"
,,
4,24,"Wow! Maybe you should
"
,,
4,24,"think about publishing it.
"
,,
4,24,"Hey, if you ask daddy, he might even
"
,,
4,24,"give you some money to do it yourself.
"
,,
4,24,"That's a great idea, Lois!
"
,,
4,24,"I'll talk to him tomorrow.
"
,,
4,24,"If this works out, I could
"
,,
4,24,"make more money
"
,,
4,24,"than when I had that
"
,,
4,24,"rat farm in the basement.
"
,,
4,24,"Armando, do you have the rent?
"
,,
4,24,"We are trying, Senor
"
,,
4,24,"Griffin, but the land,
"
,,
4,24,"she gives us nothing.
"
,,
4,24,"There is no sunlight.
"
,,
4,24,"It's been two months, Armando.
"
,,
4,24,"You're putting me in a
"
,,
4,24,"real awkward position here.
"
,,
4,24,"Oh, please, Senor Griffin,
"
,,
4,24,"just one more week.
"
,,
4,24,"I will pay you double.
"
,,
4,24,"Perhaps we can work out
"
,,
4,24,"another arrangement.
"
,,
4,24,"Oh, please, senor, not my beloved!
"
,,
4,24,"Armando, Armando...
"
,,
4,24,"it is for the children.
"
,,
4,24,"He takes the beam.
"
,,
4,24,"The spectators hold their breath
"
,,
4,24,"as Stewie Griffin
"
,,
4,24,"is America's last hope...
"
,,
4,24,"to take home the gold.
"
,,
4,24,"Oh, oh, did you see that, Mitch?
"
,,
4,24,"I sure did, Cathy that was impressive.
"
,,
4,24,"Here comes the dismount.
"
,,
4,24,"Hey, Stewie, I just took a nap.
"
,,
4,24,"You want an eye booger?
"
,,
4,24,"Oh, damn you, Chris!
"
,,
4,24,"Look what you've done!
"
,,
4,24,"I'm training for the Olympics,
"
,,
4,24,"and I need absolute concentration!
"
,,
4,24,"Look at him.
"
,,
4,24,"Look how fat he is.
"
,,
4,24,"Oh, my God, that was
"
,,
4,24,"even cooler than playing
"
,,
4,24,"with the speech function
"
,,
4,24,"on my Macintosh.
"
,,
4,24,"So, computer, what are you
"
,,
4,24,"thinking about right now?
"
,,
4,24," What do you want, homo?
"
,,
4,24," Listen, uh, Mr. Pewterschmidt,
"
,,
4,24,"you're a businessman,
"
,,
4,24,"I'm a businessman,
"
,,
4,24,"and I've got a proposal that
"
,,
4,24,"I guarantee you can't refuse.
"
,,
4,24,"See, I wrote this erotica
"
,,
4,24,"book, and I was hoping
"
,,
4,24,"you could loan me
"
,,
4,24,"$7 billion to publish it.
"
,,
4,24,"How about I loan you five dollars?
"
,,
4,24,"It's at the bottom of this jar
"
,,
4,24,"of barbed wire and salt.
"
,,
4,24,"Why do you keep these things together?
"
,,
4,24,"All right, who wants to
"
,,
4,24,"buy some Peterotica?
"
,,
4,24," Ten bucks a pop.
"
,,
4,24," I'll take one.
"
,,
4,24," Me, too!
"
,,
4,24," Hey, give me one of those.
"
,,
4,24,"I look forward to having a raging semi!
"
,,
4,24,"Wow, Peter, you're going
"
,,
4,24,"into the publishing business?
"
,,
4,24,"Yep. Mr. Pewterschmidt gave me
"
,,
4,24,"five dollars for these Xeroxes,
"
,,
4,24,"and I haven't looked back.
"
,,
4,24,"I'm such a huge fan of Peterotica.
"
,,
4,24,"There you go.
"
,,
4,24,"Thanks for reading.
"
,,
4,24,"Hi. Would you be offended
"
,,
4,24,"if I told you your prose
"
,,
4,24,"suggests a male-working class
"
,,
4,24,"version of Emily Bronte?
"
,,
4,24,"No.
"
,,
4,24,"Would you be offended if I said I'd
"
,,
4,24,"like to use your ass as a bongo drum?
"
,,
4,24,"Yes.
"
,,
4,24,"Well, then we are on
"
,,
4,24,"two different wavelengths.
"
,,
4,24,"Peter Griffin. Thanks for reading.

4,24,"""The Hot Chick Who Was Italian,""</i>
"
,,
4,24,"by Peter Griffin.</i>
"
,,
4,24,"seen this one hot chick. ""</i>
"
,,
4,24,"Oh, yeah!
"
,,
4,24,"Getting hot in here.
"
,,
4,24,"I'd better take my shirt off.
"
,,
4,24,"Wow! You know, from the other
"
,,
4,24,"side, that's kind of annoying.
"
,,
4,24,"Happy birthday, darling.
"
,,
4,24,"Oh, honey, a fur coat!
"
,,
4,24,"Thank you.
"
,,
4,24,"Well, it's not real fur. It's actually
"
,,
4,24,"made from bald eagle,
"
,,
4,24,"and it's weather-treated with a mixture
"
,,
4,24,"of whale skin oil and children's tears.
"
,,
4,24,"Yes?
"
,,
4,24,"Mr. Pewterschmidt, I'm Scott
"
,,
4,24,"Greenberg, attorney at law.
"
,,
4,24,"My client was injured
"
,,
4,24,"listening to this audio book.
"
,,
4,24,"We're suing you for
"
,,
4,24,"every penny you've got.
"
,,
4,24,"What? Why?
"
,,
4,24,"You're liable as publisher.
"
,,
4,24,"I'm here to cease your assets.
"
,,
4,24,"Griffin!
"
,,
4,24,"Well, Mr. Greenberg i'd like to see
"
,,
4,24,"you try to cease my assets after
"
,,
4,24,"battling the Rancor.
"
,,
4,24,"Didn't realize Greenberg
"
,,
4,24,"was a Jedi name.
"
,,
4,24," Hey, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
4,24," Hello, Peter.
"
,,
4,24," What's up?
"
,,
4,24," Good... Oh, damn it.
"
,,
4,24," I mean, not much.
"
,,
4,24," What you got there?
"
,,
4,24," This? It's a gun.
"
,,
4,24," Oh yeah?
"
,,
4,24," Yeah, i'm going to kill you.
"
,,
4,24," Daddy, what are you doing?
"
,,
4,24,"Your fat bastard husband ruined me!
"
,,
4,24,"I lost my home, my money,
"
,,
4,24,"and, perhaps just as serious,
"
,,
4,24,"my wife left me!
"
,,
4,24," Mom left you?
"
,,
4,24," Yeah. She ran off with Ted Turner.
"
,,
4,24,"God only knows what they're doing.
"
,,
4,24,"Should we give Elmo a bath?
"
,,
4,24," Yeah!
"
,,
4,24," Should we give Telly a bath?
"
,,
4,24," Yeah!
"
,,
4,24," Should we give Ernie a bath?
"
,,
4,24,"No! Ernie doesn't like the monster!
"
,,
4,24,"Look, you can stay with us
"
,,
4,24,"if you want, you filthy hobo.
"
,,
4,24,"You shouldn't be embarrased about
"
,,
4,24,"mooching off your kids at age 70.
"
,,
4,24,"Go to hell, fat head!
"
,,
4,24,"Have I use that one?
"
,,
4,24,"No, I haven't.
"
,,
4,24,"Yeah, fat head.
"
,,
4,24,"Daddy, don't talk to Peter like that.
"
,,
4,24,"All you've done his hole
"
,,
4,24,"life is treat him like crap.
"
,,
4,24,"Now he's offering to help you.
"
,,
4,24,"The least you can do is be grateful.
"
,,
4,24,"Mmm... all right.
"
,,
4,24,"That is settled. You stay with us.
"
,,
4,24,"I promise, you'll love it here.
"
,,
4,24,"Even more than Julia
"
,,
4,24,"Roberts loves herself.
"
,,
4,24,"Hi, i'm Julia Roberts.
"
,,
4,24,"You know, a lot of people
"
,,
4,24,"died in the tsunami.
"
,,
4,24,"But don't worry.
"
,,
4,24,"I didn't.
"
,,
4,24,"And i'll be here to
"
,,
4,24,"entertain you and love
"
,,
4,24,"my life for many, many years to come.
"
,,
4,24,"Me...
"
,,
4,24,"Me...
"
,,
4,24,"Meeeee...!
"
,,
4,24," Daddy you're not dressed.
"
,,
4,24," Huh?
"
,,
4,24,"Oh, yeah. Couldn't figure that one out.
"
,,
4,24,"You've still a guy for that.
"
,,
4,24,"Mom, I can't believe you
"
,,
4,24,"came out of that belly.
"
,,
4,24,"What is that?
"
,,
4,24,"Daddy, did you, um...
"
,,
4,24,"use the bathroom
"
,,
4,24,"this morning?
"
,,
4,24," Yeah.
"
,,
4,24," And did you remember to...
"
,,
4,24,"clean up after wets.
"
,,
4,24,"Um, no. I was hoping you'd...
"
,,
4,24,"Oh, daddy! No, no!
"
,,
4,24,"OK. Brian?
"
,,
4,24,"Oh, God, no. No, no, no, no.
"
,,
4,24,"I'll do it.
"
,,
4,24,"Daddy, I never thought you'd
"
,,
4,24,"be so lost without your money.
"
,,
4,24,"You right, Lois. Who the hell am
"
,,
4,24,"I kidding? I can't live like this.
"
,,
4,24,"I should never have come here.
"
,,
4,24,"Oh, I hate to see daddy like this.
"
,,
4,24,"Maybe there's something you
"
,,
4,24,"can do to help cheer him up.
"
,,
4,24,"Don't worry, Lois,
"
,,
4,24,"I know just what to do.
"
,,
4,24,"I am going to teach your father
"
,,
4,24,"how to be a regular guy.
"
,,
4,24,"You think you can do that?
"
,,
4,24,"Sure, I've steered our family
"
,,
4,24,"through bigger problems.
"
,,
4,24,"Like when we were cartoon
"
,,
4,24,"sketches on the Tracy Ullman Show.
"
,,
4,24,"Well, that's the end of Puss.
"
,,
4,24,"He was the best cat anyone ever had.
"
,,
4,24,"Hey, Lois, what do you say we
"
,,
4,24,"go downtown and buy a dog?
"
,,
4,24,"Hey, wait a minute.
"
,,
4,24,"You already have a dog.
"
,,
4,24," So long, Puss.
"
,,
4,24," We'll miss you.
"
,,
4,24,"It's gonna be quite a different
"
,,
4,24,"place with him gone, that's for true.
"
,,
4,24,"All right, Cathy, it looks
"
,,
4,24,"like Stewie Griffin
"
,,
4,24,"is preparing to begin the floor routine.
"
,,
4,24,"That's right, Mitch, and as we
"
,,
4,24,"watch Griffin doing this,
"
,,
4,24,"I want to remind everyone
"
,,
4,24,"that this is absolutely not gay.
"
,,
4,24,"Boy, that was really gay.
"
,,
4,24,"No, no. Didn't you just hear the
"
,,
4,24,"announcers? They said it's not gay.
"
,,
4,24,"Ha, ha. Stewie one, you zero.
"
,,
4,24,"What are we doing here?
"
,,
4,24,"Listen, I know you're upset
"
,,
4,24,"about losing your money,
"
,,
4,24,"so I wanted to show you it's not
"
,,
4,24,"so bad living like a regular guy.
"
,,
4,24," So, these people live here?
"
,,
4,24," No, this is a bus.
"
,,
4,24,"People ride it to get
"
,,
4,24,"places that they need to go.
"
,,
4,24,"You look familiar.
"
,,
4,24,"I was your gardener for 12 years.
"
,,
4,24,"You look different without
"
,,
4,24,"my lawn under you.
"
,,
4,24,"I don't take the lawn
"
,,
4,24,"with me when I go.
"
,,
4,24,"Well, I was right to
"
,,
4,24,"trust you with it, then.
"
,,
4,24,"Now, this is called waiting
"
,,
4,24,"in line at the movies.
"
,,
4,24,"It's what us regular people do.
"
,,
4,24,"Trust me, it makes it
"
,,
4,24,"that much more special
"
,,
4,24,"when we finally get inside
"
,,
4,24,"and see Renee Zellweger
"
,,
4,24,"doing her whole scrunch-face routine.
"
,,
4,24,"Oh, no, these ants are
"
,,
4,24,"ruining our picnic.
"
,,
4,24,"You meant this picnic
"
,,
4,24,"is ruining our ants.
"
,,
4,24,"you can hardly see...</i>
"
,,
4,24,"You know, Peter, what you
"
,,
4,24,"showed me today was just awful.
"
,,
4,24,"What are you talking about?
"
,,
4,24,"I really don't see what's so great
"
,,
4,24,"about being a regular person.
"
,,
4,24,"The bus smells like crap,
"
,,
4,24,"the movie theater is sticky,
"
,,
4,24,"and Renee Zellweger should only
"
,,
4,24,"be the cute friend at best.
"
,,
4,24,"You know, I never thought
"
,,
4,24,"about it till now, but...
"
,,
4,24,"maybe being a regular
"
,,
4,24,"person does suck.
"
,,
4,24,"My God, is this what my
"
,,
4,24,"whole life is destined to be?
"
,,
4,24,"Not unless you do something about it.
"
,,
4,24,"Yeah, but what?
"
,,
4,24,"Carter,
"
,,
4,24,"hand me my thinking grenades.
"
,,
4,24," Where'd you get these?
"
,,
4,24," Shh. Carter,
"
,,
4,24,"I'm thinking.
"
,,
4,24,"That might work.
"
,,
4,24,"I got it.
"
,,
4,24,"Carter, somehow you and me
"
,,
4,24,"are going to find a way to get rich.
"
,,
4,24,"Now you're talking my language.
"
,,
4,24,"All right, then, let's do it.
"
,,
4,24,"Hi. I'm Betty White.
"
,,
4,24,"I just got a subpoena
"
,,
4,24,"regarding an erotic novel,
"
,,
4,24,"and I'm looking for the
"
,,
4,24,"son of a bitch responsible.
"
,,
4,24,"All right, Peter, how are we going to
"
,,
4,24,"do this? How are we going to get rich?
"
,,
4,24,"Well, I say we start out
"
,,
4,24,"small, Carter. Here's my plan.
"
,,
4,24,"I'll distract Lois while you
"
,,
4,24,"steal money from her purse.
"
,,
4,24,"Lois, look at me!
"
,,
4,24,"Look at me! Look at me!
"
,,
4,24,"Ka-kaw! I've got her wallet.
"
,,
4,24,"Ka-kaw!
"
,,
4,24," Daddy, what are you doing?
"
,,
4,24," Look at the unicycle!
"
,,
4,24,"Well, she's got ten dollars in here.
"
,,
4,24,"And it cost me $900 for the
"
,,
4,24,"six weeks of unicycle lessons.
"
,,
4,24,"So, we're a little in the red right now.
"
,,
4,24,"But you've got to spend money to
"
,,
4,24,"make money, champ. Moving on.
"
,,
4,24,"All right, now we play it cool.
"
,,
4,24,"Hey, Meg, uh, we're trying
"
,,
4,24,"to make some money and, um...
"
,,
4,24,"would you like to buy some pot
"
,,
4,24,"from your granddaddy and me?
"
,,
4,24,"Um...
"
,,
4,24," Wow, sure.
"
,,
4,24," Oh, fantastic.
"
,,
4,24," What the hell was that for?
"
,,
4,24," Now we have to pot and the money.
"
,,
4,24,"You sure this is going to work, Peter?
"
,,
4,24,"All I know is, there's a
"
,,
4,24,"lot of money to be made
"
,,
4,24,"in these stupid teen dramas
"
,,
4,24,"they keep putting on TV.
"
,,
4,24,"And we're going to get our share.
"
,,
4,24,"Come on, Joey, I want to be with you.
"
,,
4,24,"Dawson, I'm just not ready
"
,,
4,24,"to give up my virginity.
"
,,
4,24,"Come on.
"
,,
4,24,"No.
"
,,
4,24,"I promised myself that I'd save
"
,,
4,24,"it for the man that I marry.
"
,,
4,24,"Come on, that's stupid.
"
,,
4,24,"I'm, I'm just not
"
,,
4,24,"comfortable, you know?
"
,,
4,24,"I don't...
"
,,
4,24,"This is like the '90s, man.
"
,,
4,24,"I mean, it's like, everybody's...
"
,,
4,24,"Come on, you saw me on that boat.
"
,,
4,24,"I was wearing a blazer.
"
,,
4,24," Uh? Come on.
"
,,
4,24," No! I just... I...
"
,,
4,24,"I don't want to, all right?
"
,,
4,24,"I don't want to right now.
"
,,
4,24,"I told you, I'm not comfortable.
"
,,
4,24,"I think you could respect that,
"
,,
4,24,"you know.
"
,,
4,24,"I do res...
"
,,
4,24,"I totally respect you.
"
,,
4,24,"Makes me want you more, you know.
"
,,
4,24,"Come on, man, let's just...
"
,,
4,24,"Let's just go nuts.
"
,,
4,24," No. I said I don't...
"
,,
4,24," Come on!
"
,,
4,24,"No! No! Peter, stop!
"
,,
4,24,"Just stop, all right?
"
,,
4,24,"Turn off the camera.
"
,,
4,24," God, I'm sorry, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
4,24," I don't want to do this anymore,
"
,,
4,24,"all right? You know
"
,,
4,24,"what? You went too far.
"
,,
4,24," What?
"
,,
4,24," You went too far.
"
,,
4,24,"This is character.
"
,,
4,24,"That's how... I mean...
"
,,
4,24," He's that kind of...
"
,,
4,24," No, forget it, forget it.
"
,,
4,24,"You know what? It's just
"

4,24,"weird, man. It's just weird.
"
,,
4,24,"You're weird.
"
,,
4,24,"All right, just get off it.
"
,,
4,24,"Let's just do something
"
,,
4,24,"else to make money.
"
,,
4,24,"And we will be back.
"
,,
4,24,"Stand back, Brian.
"
,,
4,24,"I'm preparing for my vault.
"
,,
4,24,"You can't vault inside the living
"
,,
4,24,"room. You're going to get hurt.
"
,,
4,24,"Yeah, I'll get hurt right
"
,,
4,24,"on to a Wheaties box.
"
,,
4,24,"I don't see that happening.
"
,,
4,24,"Yeah, who cares what
"
,,
4,24,"you say. You're a dog.
"
,,
4,24,"You can't see colors.
"
,,
4,24,"Which means you can't see
"
,,
4,24,"the colors of the American flag.
"
,,
4,24,"Commie.
"
,,
4,24,"I think I'm okay.
"
,,
4,24,"Oh, God!
"
,,
4,24,"Somebody!
"
,,
4,24,"Do I take it out or do I leave it in?
"
,,
4,24," Got it. We'll rob a train.
"
,,
4,24," Love it.
"
,,
4,24,"All aboard.
"
,,
4,24,"All right, everybody, this is a...
"
,,
4,24,"Hey, where the hell is everybody?
"
,,
4,24,"Oh, we haven't had a paying customer in
"
,,
4,24,"months. Nobody rides the train anymore.
"
,,
4,24,"Oh, well, for God's sake.
"
,,
4,24,"Are you robbers?
"
,,
4,24,"Yeah.
"
,,
4,24,"Well, you could take my wallet.
"
,,
4,24,"My MasterCard's in there.
"
,,
4,24,"Although, to be honest,
"
,,
4,24,"I'll probably just cancel it
"
,,
4,24,"before you can use it, so...
"
,,
4,24,"Give me that hole punch!
"
,,
4,24,"Is this your hole punch
"
,,
4,24,"or the train company's?
"
,,
4,24,"Well, that's, you know,
"
,,
4,24,"I got to pay for that.
"
,,
4,24,"That comes out of my paycheck...
"
,,
4,24,"if you take it.
"
,,
4,24,"Oh, really?
"
,,
4,24,"Well, I can't in all good
"
,,
4,24,"conscience take that, then.
"
,,
4,24,"Oh, good...
"
,,
4,24," Thank you... I guess.
"
,,
4,24," Yeah.
"
,,
4,24," I'm a working man myself.
"
,,
4,24," No, it's tough out there.
"
,,
4,24," You can't, you know...
"
,,
4,24," It's tough, it is.
"
,,
4,24,"All right, well, uh, can you stop
"
,,
4,24,"this thing, so we can get off?
"
,,
4,24,"Uh, no.
"
,,
4,24,"I mean, I'd love to,
"
,,
4,24,"but it stops at the
"
,,
4,24,"pre-designated stops.
"
,,
4,24,"I don't have control over that.
"
,,
4,24," The engineer does that.
"
,,
4,24," Well, uh...
"
,,
4,24,"Well, how much are tickets?
"
,,
4,24,"Well, for this, this is
"
,,
4,24,"a first-class cabin,
"
,,
4,24,"it's 25 bucks.
"
,,
4,24,"And we're the robbers.
"
,,
4,24," OK, um, how much is coach?
"
,,
4,24," Uh, $12 for coach.
"
,,
4,24,"Well, he's a senior.
"
,,
4,24,"You know what, that's fine.
"
,,
4,24,"Just give me two coach tickets.
"
,,
4,24,"All right, thank you.
"
,,
4,24,"Oh, wow, when did Mama Mia!
"
,,
4,24,"come to the Oakdale?
"
,,
4,24,"Oh, yeah, what, uh,
"
,,
4,24,"just a week ago, I think.
"
,,
4,24,"Oh, well, we should go.
"
,,
4,24,"Do you want to go see Mama Mia!?
"
,,
4,24,"Peter, could I speak to
"
,,
4,24,"you over by the door?
"
,,
4,24,"Good as new.
"
,,
4,24,"Oh, come on!
"
,,
4,24,"I give up. We're going to be
"
,,
4,24,"lower-middle class Americans forever.
"
,,
4,24,"A fate worse than death.
"
,,
4,24,"Seriously, we may as well just be dead.
"
,,
4,24,"You know what, Peter, that's not true.
"
,,
4,24,"In the time we've spent
"
,,
4,24,"together, I've learned something.
"
,,
4,24,"When you're rich, you don't
"
,,
4,24,"own your possessions,
"
,,
4,24,"your possessions own you.
"
,,
4,24," Oh, Carter, darling.
"
,,
4,24," Babs, sweetheart!
"
,,
4,24,"Honey, we're rich again.
"
,,
4,24,"I divorced Ted Turner
"
,,
4,24,"and took half his money.
"
,,
4,24," We own half of CNN.
"
,,
4,24," He-hey!
"
,,
4,24," And TNT.
"
,,
4,24," Neat.
"
,,
4,24,"All right, buddy, we did it, we're rich.
"
,,
4,24,"We? Go to hell, you fat peasant!
"
,,
4,24," Aw, crap.
"
,,
4,24," Peter, listen to me.
"
,,
4,24,"Money doesn't matter.
"
,,
4,24,"Ten years ago Daddy offered to give
"
,,
4,24,"us $10 million, and I turned it down.
"
,,
4,24," What?!
"
,,
4,24," Yes. And I'll always turn it down,
"
,,
4,24,"because money just
"
,,
4,24,"complicates everything.
"
,,
4,24,"We don't need money
"
,,
4,24,"because we have each other.
"
,,
4,24,"Happiness isn't about buying expensive
"
,,
4,24,"things, it's about being together.
"
,,
4,24,"It's not about taking expensive trips,
"
,,
4,24,"it's about holding each other
"
,,
4,24,"during a thunderstorm.
"
,,
4,24,"And we have that kind
"
,,
4,24,"of happiness, Peter.
"
,,
4,24,"Real happiness, because
"
,,
4,24,"we have each other.
"
,,
4,24,"Yeah.

4,25,"Yeah, but it's not.
"

4,25,"It'd be like Raisin Bran,
"
,,
4,25,"but it's not Raisin Bran.
"

4,25,"That'd be like Total with raisins in it.

4,25,"It's not really doing it for me.

4,25,"This is gonna be awesome!

4,25,"You said it.

4,25,"Man, you guys feel anything yet?
"
,,
4,25,"I feel kinda funny.
"

4,25,"Lois, darling, those

4,25,"You think it's clever talking like

4,25,"that, do you? You think it's funny?
"
,,
4,25,"Talking about earrings,
"
,,
4,25,"and using words like
"
,,
4,25,"""fabulous"" and ""delicious"" and ""wet. ""
"

4,25,"Oh, what's next? A workout

,,
4,25,"followed by a romp
"
,,
4,25,"around a crowded room
"
,,
4,25,"while the music goes...
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, why did you stop?
"
,,
4,25,"Hey, Jasper, let me ask you something.
"
,,
4,25,"When you're in the shower at the ""Y,""
"
,,
4,25,"is that just like Supermarket Sweep
"
,,
4,25,"for you guys, or is there
"
,,
4,25,"some kind of etiquette?
"
,,
4,25,"Peter, stop it. God! You're
"
,,
4,25,"more clueless than Popeye.
"
,,
4,25,"Sir, I think you should know
"
,,
4,25,"these growths on your forearms
"
,,
4,25,"they're giant tumors.
"
,,
4,25,"Yeah, I'm surprised you haven't realized
"
,,
4,25,"this is not how a human
"
,,
4,25,"being is supposed to look.
"
,,
4,25,"And the speech thing, and what
"
,,
4,25,"you're doing with your eye...
"
,,
4,25,"uh, you had a stroke
"
,,
4,25,"about seven years ago.
"
,,
4,25,"That you've managed to be
"
,,
4,25,"walking around all this time
"
,,
4,25,"is nothing short of a miracle.
"
,,
4,25,"I'd say about two months.
"
,,
4,25,"Okay, all right, time for
"
,,
4,25,"the big announcement.
"
,,
4,25,"Everyone, Ricardo and I
"
,,
4,25,"are getting married!
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, that is terrific! It's about
"
,,
4,25,"time you two settled down.
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, you hear that, Meg? Guys can
"
,,
4,25,"marry other guys now. So... um...
"
,,
4,25,"this is awkward, but, uh...
"
,,
4,25,"I mean, if they can do that,
"
,,
4,25,"that's pretty much it for you, isn't it?
"
,,
4,25,"I mean, you might as well
"
,,
4,25,"pack it in. Game over.
"
,,
4,25,"Alyssa, hi.
"
,,
4,25,"I was wondering if maybe you wanted to
"
,,
4,25," do something sometime?
"
,,
4,25," Sure, Chris.
"
,,
4,25,"I have a Young Republicans meeting
"
,,
4,25,"after school. You wanna come?
"
,,
4,25,"Sure. What do you do at a
"
,,
4,25,"Young Republicans meeting?
"
,,
4,25,"We help those who already have
"
,,
4,25,"the means to help themselves.
"
,,
4,25,"Also, we perpetuate the
"
,,
4,25,"ideal that Jesus chose America

"
,,
4,25,"and brown people.
"
,,
4,25,"I don't understand what you're

4,25,"of the Mayor's decision
"
,,
4,25,"to spend the town's
"

4,25,"treasury on a gold frog.
"
,,
4,25,"I don't like it. And I don't like

,,
4,25,"As far as I'm concerned,

,,
4,25,"his name is ""Dig Them. ""

4,25,"You're not welcome here, Dig Them.
"
,,
4,25,"I stand behind my decision.
"
,,
4,25,"This press conference is over.
"
,,
4,25,"I can't see you now. I can't hear
"

4,25,"Well, there you have it.

,,
4,25,"Back to you, Tom.
"
,,
4,25,"Thanks, Tom. Some damn
"
,,
4,25,"fine reporting. Damn fine. Diane?
"
,,
4,25,"Well, it's encouraging
"
,,
4,25,"to know that I'm not
"
,,
4,25,"the only Mayor West
"
,,
4,25,"who's facing difficulties.
"
,,
4,25,"But what I need now
"
,,
4,25,"is a diversion. Let's see.

4,25,"Jingle keys.

4,25,"My God! I'm a tomato!

4,25,"Oh, thank heaven.

,,
4,25,"The Von Trapp family escaped!
"
,,
4,25," Reverend Mother, I have sinned.
"
,,
4,25," What is this sin, my child?
"
,,
4,25," Oh, well. No harm done.
"
,,
4,25," I too have sinned, Mother.
"
,,
4,25," Oh, my God! That's Rolfe!
"
,,
4,25," What the hell is wrong with you?
"
,,
4,25,"Hey, I didn't start
"
,,
4,25,"this war, but it's on!
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, Lois, there you are.
"
,,
4,25,"Listen, Ricardo and I want to thank you
"
,,
4,25,"for letting us have the wedding here.
"
,,
4,25,"You're having the wedding here?
"
,,
4,25,"Yeah. I hope that's okay, Lois.
"
,,
4,25,"I offered them the house.
"
,,
4,25,"Sure. No problem.
"
,,
4,25,"Hey, McButt the Crime Dog,
"
,,
4,25,"I heard you and your little chew toy
"
,,
4,25,"getting it on last night. Keep it down.
"
,,
4,25,"Sorry, little man.
"
,,
4,25,"Ricardo and I were playing Clue,
"
,,
4,25,"and he got me in the
"
,,
4,25,"bedroom with a lead pipe.
"
,,
4,25,"Peter, I'm not sure I'm comfortable
"
,,
4,25,"having this wedding at the house.
"
,,
4,25,"Lois, I don't know what the
"
,,
4,25,"big deal is. So they're gay.
"
,,
4,25,"It's not like we're gonna have a
"
,,
4,25,"gay sex orgy in the living room.
"
,,
4,25,"That's not what I'm talking about.
"
,,
4,25,"I've got nothing against
"
,,

"
,,
4,25,"I'll watch anything

,,
4,25,"with David Schwimmer.
"
,,
4,25,"But the idea of two men
"
,,
4,25,"actually getting married.
"
,,
4,25,"It just doesn't seem right.

4,25,"Hey, I say who cares, you know?
"
,,
4,25,"If gays wanna get married and be
"
,,
4,25,"miserable like the rest of us,
"
,,
4,25,"I say we should let 'em.
"
,,
4,25," What's wrong?
"
,,
4,25," Look.
"
,,
4,25,"Some breaking news today when
"
,,
4,25,"Mayor West announced he will sign
"
,,
4,25,"a citywide ban on gay
"
,,
4,25,"marriages next week.
"
,,
4,25,"While controversial, it has
"
,,
4,25,"nonetheless effectively distracted
"
,,
4,25,"all of us from the Dig 'Em fiasco.
"
,,
4,25," The what?
"
,,
4,25," I don't know. Something about a lizard.
"
,,
4,25,"And now this.
"
,,
4,25,"Look at that.
"
,,
4,25,"In the '30s, they called this
"
,,
4,25,"an Uncle Spinny Dervish.
"
,,
4,25," Really?
"
,,
4,25," I don't know. I'm just bored.
"
,,
4,25,"A ban on gay marriage?!
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
4,25,"Matthew McConaughey?
"
,,
4,25,"Yeah. I'm looking for
"
,,
4,25,"a guy named Stewie.
"
,,
4,25,"Chris, grab his legs.
"
,,
4,25,"I gotta bury this thing.
"
,,
4,25," But I.
"
,,
4,25," Grab his legs!
"
,,
4,25,"I can't believe the wedding's off.
"
,,
4,25,"All I ever wanted was to get married
"
,,
4,25,"and make a home with a skinny,
"
,,
4,25,"hairless Filipino boy.
"
,,
4,25,"Isn't that the American dream?
"
,,
4,25,"Don't give up yet, Jasper.
"
,,
4,25,"Mayor West only banned
"
,,
4,25,"gay marriage so
"
,,
4,25,"he could distract from the Dig 'Em scandal.
"
,,
4,25,"He won't get away with it.
"
,,
4,25,"Ah, Jasper, where'd you
"
,,
4,25,"get these brownies?
"
,,
4,25,"They're from a bakery in
"
,,
4,25,"the West Quahog gay district.
"
,,
4,25,"I thought they'd help my depression.
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, I can see why.
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, my God, they pack
"
,,
4,25,"so much fudge into these.
"
,,
4,25,"And look at this, there's even
"
,,
4,25,"a couple of nuts lodged in there.
"
,,
4,25,"I'm going upstairs.
"
,,
4,25,"I've got to do something.
"
,,
4,25,"Jasper's always been there
"
,,
4,25,"for me when I've needed him.
"
,,
4,25,"I am going to make
"
,,
4,25,"Mayor West change his mind.
"
,,
4,25,"But, Brian, the Bible says gay
"
,,
4,25,"marriage is an abomination.
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, don't give me that
"
,,
4,25,"Young Republican crap, Chris.
"
,,
4,25,"The Bible also says a
"
,,
4,25,"senior citizen built an
"
,,
4,25,"ark and rounded up two of every animal.
"
,,
4,25,"What the hell is this?
"
,,
4,25,"you didn't really give any
"
,,
4,25,"specific guidelines about mating.
"
,,
4,25," Did you name it?
"
,,
4,25," What?
"
,,
4,25," Did you name it?
"
,,
4,25," Uh, yeah, he's Paul.
"
,,
4,25,"Yeah, it's going to be a hell
"
,,
4,25,"of a lot harder for you now,
"
,,
4,25,"'cause he's going the **** overboard.
"
,,
4,25,"Hi, Glenn.
"
,,
4,25,"Hey, will you sign a petition to overturn
"
,,
4,25,"Mayor West's ban on gay marriage?
"
,,
4,25,"Gay marriage?
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, come on,
"
,,
4,25,"two halves can't make
"
,,
4,25,"a whole without a hole.
"
,,
4,25,"You get off my property, you pervert.
"
,,
4,25,"Uh, Mr. Bottomtooth, would
"
,,
4,25,"you like to sign the petition?
"
,,
4,25,"Uh, I don't...
"
,,
4,25,"wha-wha-what's the problem?
"
,,
4,25,"Uh, okay. Thank you.
"
,,
4,25,"Chris, did you hear?
"
,,
4,25,"Some dog is going around town
"
,,
4,25,"trying to get support for gay marriage.
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, that's Brian. He's got a petition.
"
,,
4,25,"Really? Chris, you've got
"
,,
4,25,"to destroy that petition.
"
,,
4,25,"Why?
"
,,
4,25,"Because if you do, I'll
"
,,
4,25,"let you touch my boobs.
"
,,
4,25,"Is... is that good?
"
,,
4,25," Do I want that?
"
,,
4,25," Oh, yeah, you want that.
"
,,
4,25,"Well, fantastic then.
"
,,
4,25,"How can I help you, Mrs. Griffin?
"
,,
4,25,"Well, I'm having a bit of a crisis.
"
,,
4,25,"I'm a very open-minded person,
"
,,
4,25,"and I've never had any
"
,,
4,25,"problem with gays before, but
"
,,
4,25,"something about two gay people getting
"
,,
4,25,"married, I just don't think it's right.
"
,,
4,25,"Well, these questions are too big
"
,,
4,25,"to be decided by human beings.
"
,,
4,25,"Which is why God made this film.
"
,,
4,25,"You know, there's been a lot
"
,,
4,25,"of talk lately about homosexuals,
"
,,
4,25,"but how do you know what to believe?
"
,,
4,25,"Well, here are a few tips
"
,,
4,25,"that may help you tell
"
,,
4,25,"when you've got a gay.
"
,,
4,25,"So what's your favorite Madonna album?
"
,,
4,25,"I like her early work.
"
,,
4,25,"Let's take a blood sample, Mr. Braga.
"
,,
4,25,"Wow, that was interesting.
"
,,
4,25,"I also have My Giant with Billy Crystal.
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, God, no, no.
"
,,
4,25,"Well, we almost have enough signatures,
"
,,
4,25,"thanks to Ouahog's gay district.
"
,,
4,25,"Lois, how'd you like to be
"
,,
4,25,"signature number 10,000?
"
,,
4,25,"Brian, I can't sign this.
"
,,
4,25,"Why not?
"
,,
4,25,"Well, because I don't
"
,,
4,25,"believe in gay marriage.
"
,,
4,25,"You don't believe...?
"
,,
4,25,"Lois, that's ridiculous. Gay people
"
,,
4,25,"have every right to get married.
"
,,
4,25,"Well, they certainly have every
"
,,
4,25,"right to be together, but marriage
"
,,
4,25,"should be between a man and a woman.
"
,,
4,25,"Well, that's not how they
"
,,
4,25,"do it in West Quahog.
"
,,
4,25,"By the way, Lois, I got
"
,,
4,25,"a piercing over there.
"
,,
4,25,"I'm not going to tell you
"
,,
4,25,"where, but I'll give you a hint.
"
,,
4,25,"It wasn't my nose or my ear
"
,,
4,25,"and it was one of my balls.
"
,,
4,25,"Well, regardless of what you think,
"
,,
4,25,"this is going to change
"
,,
4,25,"Mayor West's mind,
"
,,
4,25,"and we are going to have
"
,,
4,25,"Jasper's wedding here.
"
,,
4,25,"Fine. Then until this is all over,
"
,,
4,25,"I'll stay somewhere else.
"
,,
4,25,"Come on, Stewie, we're going
"
,,
4,25,"to Grandma and Grandpa's.
"
,,
4,25,"Fine I'll go, but I'm not
"
,,
4,25,"missing that gay wedding.
"
,,
4,25,"I still kick myself for missing
"
,,
4,25,"that Topless Cheerleader Parade
"
,,
4,25,"with the hundred-foot
"
,,
4,25,"chocolate teddy bear
"
,,
4,25,"and the F-16s doing aerial acrobatics
"
,,
4,25,"choreographed to the music of Queen.
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, I remember that day.
"
,,
4,25,"Should have gone to that thing.
"
,,
4,25,"My petition!
"
,,
4,25,"What the hell are you doing?
"
,,
4,25,"I'm going to get to touch
"
,,
4,25,"right-wing boob because of this.
"
,,
4,25,"You idiot! Now I'm going to have
"
,,
4,25,"to get 10,000 more signatures
"
,,
4,25,"before tomorrow morning.
"
,,
4,25,"What were you thinking?!
"
,,
4,25,"You don't understand, Brian.
"
,,
4,25,"When was the last time you
"
,,
4,25,"were even with a woman?
"
,,
4,25,"Uh... when did the Challenger blow up?
"
,,
4,25,"'86.
"
,,
4,25,"Yeah, it was like
"
,,
4,25,"three years before that.
"
,,
4,25,"Mayor West, here's the gay
"
,,
4,25,"marriage ban for your approval.
"
,,
4,25,"Excellent.
"
,,
4,25,"This is so important,
"
,,
4,25,"I'm going to sign it with all
"
,,
4,25,"capital letters. it's going to say,
"
,,
4,25,"""ADAM WEST.""
"
,,
4,25,"That's what it's going
"
,,
4,25,"to say, you'll see.
"
,,
4,25,"Hey, buddy, you can't go in there.
"
,,
4,25,"Mayor West, you have to look at this.
"
,,
4,25,"I've been up for 24 hours,
"
,,
4,25,"I paid off a few people
"
,,
4,25,"and I did a few things in
"
,,
4,25,"West Quahog I'm not proud of.
"
,,
4,25,"So, it's a show about three
"
,,
4,25,"hookers and their mom?
"
,,
4,25,"This is very impressive,
"
,,
4,25,"but my decision stands.
"
,,
4,25,"No!
"
,,
4,25,"Come on, buddy, you're leaving.
"
,,
4,25,"No, I can't let Jasper down.
"
,,
4,25,"I'm not going to let you sign that.
"
,,
4,25,"Go on, get out of here.
"
,,
4,25,"I should warn you,
"
,,
4,25,"I have a tiny bullet-proof
"
,,
4,25,"shield the exact size of a bullet
"
,,
4,25,"somewhere on my body.
"
,,
4,25,"And if you hit it,
"
,,
4,25,"I'll be unharmed and
"
,,
4,25,"your plan will be foiled.
"
,,
4,25,"You'll be the laughingstock of me.
"
,,
4,25,"I don't want to shoot you, Mayor West.
"
,,
4,25,"Good, because I'm incredibly crafty.
"
,,
4,25,"Hey, what's that on the ceiling?
"
,,
4,25,"Now I'm over here.
"
,,
4,25,"Look, this has gotten
"
,,
4,25,"out of hand, I know.
"
,,
4,25,"I don't want anyone to get hurt.
"
,,
4,25,"You can put an end to this right now
"
,,
4,25,"by tearing up that gay marriage ban.
"
,,
4,25,"You won't break me.
"
,,
4,25,"everything I needed to
"
,,
4,25,"escape from a hostage situation.
"
,,
4,25,"A wall!
"
,,
4,25,"Well, no matter. I'm prepared
"
,,
4,25,"for a lengthy captivity as well.
"
,,
4,25,"I swallowed this People magazine in 1989.
"
,,
4,25,"All right, Paul Hogan, tell me
"
,,
4,25,"about the real Crocodile Dundee.
"
,,
4,25,"It's so nice to have you home, dear.
"
,,
4,25,"I can take it or leave it.
"
,,
4,25,"God, this is such an old
"
,,
4,25,"people house, you know.
"
,,
4,25,"I mean, look at this candy jar.
"
,,
4,25,"Let's take a look in here.
"
,,
4,25,"Let's see what you got here.
"
,,
4,25,"You got, uh...
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, you got licorice.
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, that's, uh, that's, uh...
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, Freedent.
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, that's good.
"
,,
4,25,"Yeah, yeah, I got a sweet tooth,
"
,,
4,25,"I think I'll have some Freedent.
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, what's this?
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, a cough drop.
"
,,
4,25,"A Luden's cough drop.
"
,,
4,25,"Is that candy?
"
,,
4,25,"No, I don't think that's candy.
"
,,
4,25,"I think it's a cough drop!
"
,,
4,25,"Uh, what else we got?
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, look, look at this.
"
,,
4,25,"There's a fishing lure in here.
"
,,
4,25,"There's a fishing lure in the candy jar.
"
,,
4,25,"What, am I supposed to eat this?
"
,,
4,25,"Eat a fishing lure?
"
,,
4,25,"Hey, look, Brian's on TV.
"
,,
4,25,"And now, some Channel 5
"
,,
4,25,"exclusive footage of the
"
,,
4,25,"crazed homosexual gunman
"
,,
4,25,"who's taken Mayor West hostage.
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, my God! Brian's taken
"
,,
4,25,"the Mayor hostage?!
"
,,
4,25,"Is this an eyeglass lens?
"
,,
4,25,"I didn't realize how
"
,,
4,25,"strongly he feels about this.
"
,,
4,25,"Gay marriage. Next thing you
"
,,
4,25,"know, they'll want to vote.
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, oh, look at this.
"
,,
4,25,"A spare key
"
,,
4,25,"for a Volkswagen Scirocco.
"
,,
4,25,"They don't even make this anymore.
"
,,
4,25,"They don't even make this car anymore.
"
,,
4,25,"Whose key could this possibly be?
"
,,
4,25,"What if Brian's right? I mean,
"
,,
4,25,"certainly the love between a man and
"
,,
4,25,"a woman should be sacred, but...
"
,,
4,25,"Who's talking about love?
"
,,
4,25,"We're talking about marriage.
"
,,
4,25,"Well, don't you love Mom?
"
,,
4,25,"Come on, Lois, look at her.
"
,,
4,25,"So two straight people who hate each
"
,,
4,25,"other have more of a right to be together
"
,,
4,25,"than two gay people who love each other?
"
,,
4,25,"That's what we raised you to believe.
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
4,25,"I've made a terrible mistake!
"
,,
4,25,"I've been brainwashed
"
,,
4,25,"like Elizabeth Smart.
"
,,
4,25,"It's so wonderful having her home again.
"
,,
4,25,"She's brought music back into the
"
,,
4,25,"house. Playing songs on the harp.
"
,,
4,25,"Of course, most of them are
"
,,
4,25,"about rape, but it's still nice.
"
,,
4,25,"I think I made Brian crazy.
"
,,
4,25,"Maybe I shouldn't have
"
,,
4,25,"burned that petition.
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, no, Chris, you did the right thing.
"
,,
4,25,"It's only a matter of time
"
,,
4,25,"before Mayor West signs
"
,,
4,25,"that bill, and you'll
"
,,
4,25,"get to touch these.
"
,,
4,25,"Oh, boy, I got a feeling that
"
,,
4,25,"before the end of the day,
"
,,
4,25,"I'm going to be burying my dog.
"
,,
4,25,"Whoa, whoa, I said you could
"
,,
4,25,"touch my boobs. Let's start with that.
"
,,
4,25,"Look, Peter, if you can't
"
,,
4,25,"get Brian to come out
"
,,
4,25,"peacefully, we're going to
"
,,
4,25,"have to take him down.
"
,,
4,25,"Don't worry, Joe, I'm
"
,,
4,25,"good with tight situations.
"
,,
4,25,"Like when I saved Luke Skywalker's life.
"
,,
4,25,"Okay, Luke,
"
,,
4,25,"this will keep you warm
"
,,
4,25,"until I get the shelter built.
"
,,
4,25," You sure this is okay?
"
,,
4,25," Yeah, you're just cutting into the fat.
"
,,
4,25,"All right, Brian, Peter's coming in.
"
,,
4,25,"I'll relax him by using my catchphrase.
"
,,
4,25,"Hey, whassa happa witchu?
"
,,
4,25," What the hell was that?
"
,,
4,25," My catchphrase.
"
,,
4,25,"You don't have a catchphrase.
"
,,
4,25,"Why you gotta sayya like a-dat?
"
,,
4,25,"Excuse me.
"
,,
4,25,"Would anyone like to play
"
,,
4,25,"Stratego? I have Stratego.
"
,,
4,25,"Peter, I never meant for this to happen.
"
,,
4,25,"This whole situation is
"
,,
4,25,"totally spiraled out of control.
"
,,
4,25,"Brian, listen to me.
"
,,
4,25,"I was wrong. If two
"
,,
4,25,"people love each other,
"
,,
4,25,"they should have the
"
,,
4,25,"right to get married.
"
,,
4,25,"But you have to come
"
,,
4,25,"down and give yourself up.
"
,,
4,25,"If you drag this out any longer,
"
,,
4,25,"you're only hurting your own cause.
"
,,
4,25,"She's right.
"
,,
4,25,"I'm sorry, Mayor West.
"
,,
4,25,"Well, you were only doing what
"
,,
4,25,"you thought was right, Brian.
"
,,
4,25,"And, hey, you've distracted
"
,,
4,25,"everyone from the Dig 'Em statue,
"
,,
4,25,"so I guess we don't
"
,,
4,25,"need this bill anymore.
"
,,
4,25,"Evera-bodah ha-ppy!
"
,,
4,25,"Well, it sure was nice of Mayor West
"
,,
4,25,"to drop the kidnapping charges.
"
,,
4,25,"Amazing. All he asked for in return
"
,,
4,25,"was the key to a Volkswagen Scirocco.
"
,,
4,25,"You're welcome.
"
,,
4,25,"Listen, Lois, I...
"
,,
4,25,"I really appreciate you
"
,,
4,25,"putting your discomfort aside,
"
,,
4,25,"so we can have the wedding here.
"
,,
4,25,"Please, I'm over all that now.
"
,,
4,25,"Two men getting married
"
,,
4,25,"doesn't bother me in the least.
"
,,
4,25,"They deserve happiness.
"
,,
4,25,"Everybody gay!

"
,,
4,26,"It's going to be tight, y'all.
"
,,
4,26,"Oh, my God, Joe, how did you do this?
"
,,
4,26,"I built it myself with supplies I got
"
,,
4,26,"at the Home Supply downtown.
"
,,
4,26,"Between you and me, I think Joe's
"
,,
4,26,"got a little free time these days.
"
,,
4,26,"I hear he hasn't touched
"
,,
4,26,"Bonnie in months.
"
,,
4,26,"Peter, you just whispered that to me.
"
,,
4,26,"Here he is...
"
,,
4,26,"Joe, what a great job you've done here.
"
,,
4,26,"All right, let's get this started.

4,26,"Joe Swanson Theatres.</i>
"
,,
4,26,"Rocky, please don't go to
"
,,
4,26,"Mars and fight the Martian.
"
,,
4,26,"I got to do what I got to do.
"
,,
4,26,"But there's no oxygen on Mars.
"
,,
4,26,"Yeah? That means there's
"
,,
4,26,"no oxygen for him, either.
"
,,
4,26,"That Martian wants a fight,
"
,,
4,26,"he'll get a fight.
"
,,
4,26,"You can't win, Rock!
"
,,
4,26,"You're 60 years old!
"
,,
4,26,"Hey, look what Rocky
"
,,
4,26,"bought me with his money.
"
,,
4,26,"Freakin' Joe with his home theater.
"
,,
4,26,"Has to top everything I do.
"
,,
4,26,"Well, tomorrow I'm going
"
,,
4,26,"to that home supply
"
,,
4,26,"and I'm going to build
"
,,
4,26,"an entire multiplex.
"
,,
4,26,"Well, let's just hope it looks
"
,,
4,26,"better than that balcony you built.
"
,,
4,26,"Boy, that was a great episode
"
,,
4,26,"of Lost, wasn't it, fellows?
"
,,
4,26,"Well, at least the show's
"
,,
4,26,"got the right name.
"
,,
4,26,"Yeah, I couldn't follow any of it.
"
,,
4,26,"They don't care for most things.
"
,,
4,26,"Can I help you?
"
,,
4,26,"Yeah, I hate my neighbor and I want
"
,,
4,26,"to build something crazy out of spite.
"
,,
4,26,"Well, I'll take you to our
"
,,
4,26,"""OneUpsmanship"" aisle.
"
,,
4,26,"Man, this place has everything.
"
,,
4,26,"I bet you could even get
"
,,
4,26,"one of those gay mailboxes.
"
,,
4,26,"Hello, hello! Right here.
"
,,
4,26,"Yeah, just right here.
"
,,
4,26,"Just go ahead and put
"
,,
4,26,"that right in here. Yeah.
"
,,
4,26,"Gulp.
"
,,
4,26,"Just kidding.
"
,,
4,26,"Uh, pardon me.
"
,,
4,26,"I just bought a Rottweiler and I need a
"
,,
4,26,"sign to warn people how dangerous it is.
"
,,
4,26,"Well, we have exactly what...
"
,,
4,26,"Ah, yes, here it is, ""one way. ""
"
,,
4,26,"So people will know if
"
,,
4,26,"they step into my yard,
"
,,
4,26,"there's only one way out...
"
,,
4,26,"in a body bag...
"
,,
4,26,"from dog injuries.
"
,,
4,26,"Good day, ma'am.
"
,,
4,26,"This'll teach Joe to
"
,,
4,26,"steal my movie night.
"
,,
4,26,"I'm going to have my
"
,,
4,26,"own multiplex theater.
"
,,
4,26,"I haven't been this excited since
"
,,
4,26,"I learned how to speak Braille.
"
,,
4,26,"Hey, bump, bump,
"
,,
4,26,"no bump, bump, three vertical bumps,
"
,,
4,26,"four bumps and a square.
"
,,
4,26,"Yeah, I've heard they all look alike.
"
,,
4,26,"Hey, look what I found.
"
,,
4,26,"Wow, authentic Native American remains.
"
,,
4,26,"Peter, I'd put that back if I were you.
"
,,
4,26,"You may be disturbing
"
,,
4,26,"a sacred burial site.
"
,,
4,26,"Hey, look, it's Robin Williams.

4,26,"Gay Elmer Fudd.
"
,,
4,26,"Ah, the more you hear it,
"
,,
4,26,"the funnier it gets.
"
,,
4,26,"Want some more peas,
"
,,
4,26,"Chief Diamond Phillips?
"
,,
4,26,"Peter, I really think you should
"
,,
4,26,"put that back where you found it.
"
,,
4,26,"You know, Brian, I really don't think
"
,,
4,26,"you should breast-feed the skull.
"
,,
4,26," I'm not breast-feeding.
"
,,
4,26," All right, fine.
"
,,
4,26,"God, you're pushy.
"
,,
4,26,"Suck, suck, suck, suck, suck...
"
,,
4,26," So many nipples. Suck, suck, suck.
"
,,
4,26," Knock it off!
"
,,
4,26,"Oh, I'm Brian. I'm having sustenance.
"
,,
4,26,"Look at me, everybody. I'm breast-feeding
"
,,
4,26,"in public even though it's wrong.

,,
4,26,"Fast Talking High Trousers.</i>
"
,,
4,26," Well, isn't this a fine song and dance?
"
,,
4,26," What are you getting so hot about?
"
,,
4,26," Keep your shirt on.
"
,,
4,26," Where do you get off making remarks like that?
"
,,
4,26," Supposing I say you're a lunkhead?
"
,,
4,26," Well, I ain't much for supposing.
"
,,
4,26," Well, supposing you were?
"
,,
4,26," Maybe I'm through supposing and I fix to start figuring.
"
,,
4,26," Ah, horseradish.
"
,,
4,26," Aren't you a pocketful of firecrackers?
"
,,
4,26," Yeah? You got something to say about it?
"
,,
4,26," I'll say plenty.
"
,,
4,26,"I can't wait to see the expression on
"
,,
4,26,"Joe's legs when I open my multiplex.
"
,,
4,26,"I have to say I'm a little
"
,,
4,26,"concerned about the zoning for...
"
,,
4,26,"Peter, are you peeing in that skull?
"
,,
4,26,"No, Lois, I'm getting up
"
,,
4,26,"and walking all the way
"
,,
4,26,"to the bathroom and doing it there.
"
,,
4,26,"Pain in the ass.
"
,,
4,26,"This concludes our broadcast day.
"
,,
4,26,"The only time of the day I get to try
"
,,
4,26,"out my Fred Schneider B-52s voice.
"
,,
4,26,"Now try to get some sleep out there.
"
,,
4,26,"Not bad.
"
,,
4,26,"Getting better.
"
,,
4,26,"Yeah.
"
,,
4,26,"Uh-huh.
"
,,
4,26,"I don't know.
"
,,
4,26,"I don't know.
"
,,
4,26,"Oh, you didn't see it? Uh...
"
,,
4,26,"Ross and Rachel got back
"
,,
4,26,"together. It wasn't that great.
"
,,
4,26," Holy crap!
"
,,
4,26," What the hell was that?
"
,,
4,26,"Stewie, what are you doing?
"
,,
4,26,"They're here.
"
,,
4,26," Who's here?
"
,,
4,26," The TV people.
"
,,
4,26,"What?
"
,,
4,26,"No, they did a spin-off.
"
,,
4,26,"He's still playing Joey,
"
,,
4,26,"but... eh, it's not doing so well.
"
,,
4,26,"Uh, Lois, have you, uh,
"
,,
4,26,"noticed some spooky things going on
"
,,
4,26,"ever since Peter brought
"
,,
4,26,"that skull into the house?
"
,,
4,26,"No. What are you talking about?
"
,,
4,26,"Well, like the whole business
"
,,
4,26,"last night with the TV.
"
,,
4,26,"I'm just saying maybe,
"
,,
4,26,"maybe we have a poltergeist.
"
,,
4,26,"Brian, there's no such thing as ghosts.
"
,,
4,26,"It's all just...
"
,,
4,26,"Oh, I must have accidentally stacked
"
,,
4,26,"all those things upside down
"
,,
4,26,"and then just forgot about it.
"
,,
4,26,"Yeah, that's probably what happened.
"
,,
4,26,"Well, I haven't seen this much denial
"
,,
4,26,"since John Travolta married Kelly Preston.
"
,,
4,26,"John, do you take
"
,,
4,26,"Kelly to be your wife?
"
,,
4,26,"I totally do. I mean,
"
,,
4,26,"yeah, yes. Absolutely.
"
,,
4,26,"And I'm going to do
"
,,
4,26,"stuff to her, too, like...
"
,,
4,26,"touch her.
"
,,
4,26,"Yeah, touch her and...
"
,,
4,26,"kiss her.
"
,,
4,26,"And touch her penis.
"
,,
4,26,"I mean, no, not that, not that.
"
,,
4,26,"Okay, okay, try to think of a
"
,,
4,26,"happy place to be. Happy place...
"
,,
4,26,"Um, okay, okay...
"
,,
4,26,"I'm on MTV's Jackass.
"
,,
4,26,"Hey, I'm Stewie Griffin,
"
,,
4,26,"and I'm going to be kicking
"
,,
4,26,"my dad's ass all day today.
"
,,
4,26,"What the hell?! Ah! Stewie!
"
,,
4,26,"Stop! Ah! Ah! Knock it off!
"
,,
4,26,"Knock it...! Ah! Ah!
"
,,
4,26,"Come on!
"
,,
4,26,"Come on, Stewie.
"
,,
4,26,"You're acting crazy out there, man.
"
,,
4,26,"I haven't seen anything
"
,,
4,26,"suck this much since...
"
,,
4,26,"I Heart Huckabees!
"
,,
4,26,"Propane.
"
,,
4,26,"I wish that scary-looking clown at
"
,,
4,26,"the end of my bed would go away.
"
,,
4,26,"That there is my man.
"
,,
4,26,"Why don't you pick on
"
,,
4,26,"someone your own size?
"
,,
4,26,"You shall not pass.
"
,,
4,26,"Stewie?
"
,,
4,26,"Oh, my God, Stewie, honey!
"
,,
4,26,"Where are you?!
"
,,
4,26,"Peter, I can't find him anywhere.
"
,,
4,26," Stewie?</i>
"
,,
4,26,"Where are you?
"
,,
4,26,"Stewie?
"
,,
4,26,"Oh, my God! What's happening?
"
,,
4,26,"I want to try something.</i>
"
,,
4,26,"Thank you for coming.
"
,,
4,26,"We've never hired a
"
,,
4,26,"spiritual medium before,
"
,,
4,26,"but I'll do anything
"
,,
4,26,"to get my baby back.
"
,,
4,26,"You know, Peter, we wouldn't have
"
,,
4,26,"to be messing around with ghosts
"
,,
4,26,"if you hadn't desecrated
"
,,
4,26,"those Indian remains.
"
,,
4,26,"Probably a bad time to mention I'm
"
,,
4,26,"wearing the skull as an athletic cup.
"
,,
4,26,"Okay, let's talk to some spirits.
"
,,
4,26,"Hey, how y'all ghosts doing?
"
,,
4,26,"Y'all got a little friend of
"
,,
4,26,"ours named Stewart up there.
"
,,
4,26,"We was just wondering
"
,,
4,26,"if you could send him back.
"
,,
4,26,"Uh-huh.
"
,,
4,26,"Well, yes, but I...
"
,,
4,26,"Well, I don't see how that's
"
,,
4,26,"anybody's business but my own.
"
,,
4,26,"Well, how about you and my father
"
,,
4,26,"go and hang out at the gun range
"
,,
4,26,"some afternoon and you can spend the
"
,,
4,26,"whole day just agreeing with each other.
"
,,
4,26,"What are they saying?
"
,,
4,26,"Is my baby all right?
"
,,
4,26,"They said that your baby had entered
"
,,
4,26,"their world through the closet upstairs
"
,,
4,26,"and that the exit is...
"
,,
4,26,"Well, I don't know
"
,,
4,26,"how else to say this, but...
"
,,
4,26,"the exit is your daughter's bum.
"
,,
4,26,"Meg's ass!
"
,,
4,26,"You ready down there?
"
,,
4,26,"Okay, Meg, if this works, then we might
"
,,
4,26,"just have a chance at getting Stewie back.
"
,,
4,26," Are you ready?
"
,,
4,26," No.
"
,,
4,26," Ready!
"
,,
4,26," Okay, here we go.
"
,,
4,26," Got it!
"
,,
4,26," Cool!
"
,,
4,26," Ass ball!
"
,,
4,26," Peter, it worked!
"
,,
4,26,"We found the portal to the other side.
"
,,
4,26,"Peter, what the hell
"
,,
4,26,"are you doing up there?
"
,,
4,26,"We're gonna get those terrorists.
"
,,
4,26,"Now watch this drive.
"
,,
4,26,"Stewie?! Stewie, if you can
"
,,
4,26,"hear me head for Meg's butt!
"
,,
4,26,"Get ready to laugh.</i>
"
,,
4,26,"Gee, must've taken a
"
,,
4,26,"wrong turn at Albuquerque.
"
,,
4,26,"Are you sure Stewie
"
,,
4,26,"can find his way out?
"
,,
4,26,"We just got to be patient, Lois,
"
,,
4,26,"like waiting on the
"
,,
4,26,"results of a blood test,
"
,,
4,26,"a real important blood test.
"
,,
4,26,"Will I ever see my baby brother again?
"
,,
4,26,"Only if he can find his
"
,,
4,26,"way into the light, Chris.
"
,,
4,26,"For some people, it's easier than others.
"
,,
4,26,"Some people just get lost
"
,,
4,26,"on the way to the light.
"
,,
4,26,"They're walking along,
"
,,
4,26,"they stop and say,
"
,,
4,26,"""Ooh, is that a new restaurant?""
"
,,
4,26,"""That place must've just opened up. ""
"
,,
4,26,"Cause I remember there was
"
,,
4,26,"another place there a few weeks ago.
"
,,
4,26,"I went in there once and there was
"
,,
4,26,"a guy with a harelip eating soup,
"
,,
4,26,"and I was like, ""Ew... '""
"
,,
4,26,"It wasn't the restaurant's fault, I know.
"
,,
4,26,"But I still never went back there.
"
,,
4,26,"I mean, I guess there's only,
"
,,
4,26,"like, a one in 50 chance
"
,,
4,26,"of me getting the same
"
,,
4,26,"spoon that he had,
"
,,
4,26,"but I still don't like them odds.
"
,,
4,26,"Oh, I can't bear this anymore!
"
,,
4,26,"If Stewie can't find his
"
,,
4,26,"way out of Meg's ass,
"
,,
4,26,"we have to enter the other
"
,,
4,26,"realm and get him ourselves.
"
,,
4,26,"Lois, I told you it ain't safe.
"
,,
4,26,"I'll tell you what's not safe:
"
,,
4,26,"going hunting with Dick Cheney.
"
,,
4,26,"So you all set to go hunting?
"
,,
4,26,"Sorry, I thought you were a deer.
"
,,
4,26," Be careful, Lois.
"
,,
4,26," I will, Peter.
"
,,
4,26,"I don't feel anything!
"
,,
4,26,"Now she knows how I felt
"
,,
4,26,"when I was at her piano recital.
"
,,
4,26,"No, you're doing fine, Meg.
"
,,
4,26,"Stewie, you're all right!
"
,,
4,26,"Oh, thank God you guys are... ew!
"
,,
4,26,"You're covered in slime.
"
,,
4,26,"Ugh! This must be how Tom Arnold
"
,,
4,26,"felt on his wedding night.
"
,,
4,26,"Holy crap! Let's get out of here.
"
,,
4,26,"Wait a minute. Where's Meg?
"
,,
4,26," I don't know.
"
,,
4,26," I didn't see her.
"
,,
4,26,"Yeah, I kind of thought you
"
,,
4,26,"guys would attend to that.
"
,,
4,26,"Peter, you got to go back and get her.
"
,,
4,26,"Oh, yeah, right, like
"
,,
4,26,"I'm going back for Meg.
"
,,
4,26," Peter!
"
,,
4,26," Lois, damn it, we both agreed, remember?
"
,,
4,26,"If we could only save two, we leave Meg.
"
,,
4,26," I know, but...
"
,,
4,26," You bastard!
"
,,
4,26,"How could you leave me in there?!
"
,,
4,26,"Okay, see? It resolved itself.
"
,,
4,26,"Oh, I forgot one thing.
"
,,
4,26,"A bit of breaking news. A local family
"
,,
4,26,"is forced out of their home by ghosts.
"
,,
4,26,"Who are they gonna call?
"
,,
4,26,"Ghostbusters, Tom?
"
,,
4,26,"No, Diane, their insurance company.
"
,,
4,26,"That's just stupid what you said.
"
,,
4,26,"And now back to Disney's Too
"
,,
4,26,"Many Ostriches starring Don Knotts.
"
,,
4,26,"There's way too many ostriches.
"
,,
4,26,"Why there's so many ostriches?
"
,,
4,26,"The brochure said there'd
"
,,
4,26,"only be a few ostriches.
"
,,
4,26,"This is a terrible vacation!
"
,,
4,26,"So, what was it like
"
,,
4,26,"on the other side?
"
,,
4,26," Well, I met Jesus up there.
"
,,
4,26," Wow, what's he like?
"
,,
4,26,"Uh, believe it or not, he's Chinese.
"
,,
4,26," Really?
"
,,
4,26," Yup, Jesus is Chinese.
"
,,
4,26,"In fact, his last name is Hong.
"
,,
4,26,"Jesus Hong.
"
,,
4,26,"Says he has no idea where
"
,,
4,26,"people are getting ""Christ. ""
"
,,
4,26,"Quagmire, you got to help us.
"
,,
4,26,"We pissed off a bunch of ghosts,
"
,,
4,26,"and now our house is gone
"
,,
4,26,"and we got no place to stay.
"
,,
4,26,"Uh, Peter, this is the best time.
"
,,
4,26,"Yeah, honey, I'll be right there.
"
,,
4,26,"I'll be right there.
"
,,
4,26,"Peter, I'm really slammed right now.
"
,,
4,26,"Can you give me the short version?
"
,,
4,26,"Uh, what, uh...
"
,,
4,26," What's going on in there?
"
,,
4,26," Nothing.
"
,,
4,26,"So, as you can see, my family's here.
"
,,
4,26,"and, uh, it's game night.
"
,,
4,26,"We're playing...
"
,,
4,26,"sex.
"
,,
4,26,"Ugh, a soup kitchen, Dad?
"
,,
4,26,"Isn't there any other place we can go?
"
,,
4,26,"We're homeless, Meg.
"
,,
4,26,"This is where homeless people go.
"
,,
4,26,"Well, it'll just be good
"
,,
4,26,"to get some food in us.
"
,,
4,26,"Hi, welcome to the soup kitchen.
"
,,
4,26,"I'll just start you off with this basket
"
,,
4,26,"of pizza crusts and apple cores.
"
,,
4,26,"Oh, and we do have one special today.
"
,,
4,26,"It's an avocado pit with a
"
,,
4,26,"little bit of avocado still on it,
"
,,
4,26,"and that comes on a ripped
"
,,
4,26,"pair of boxer shorts.
"
,,
4,26,"Now, I'm trying to decide between
"
,,
4,26,"the tossed spaghetti on a newspaper
"
,,
4,26,"and the half yogurt with
"
,,
4,26,"the balled-up tissue in it.
"
,,
4,26,"Hi, there. Do you have any

4,27," I think I did.
"
,,
4,27," Did you fill out the 1170?
"
,,
4,27," I filled this out.
"
,,
4,27,"That's the 1190. You're gonna
"
,,
4,27,"have to go stand in the blue line.
"
,,
4,27," I was already in that line.
"
,,
4,27," Sir, don't get snippy with me.
"
,,
4,27," I've been here all morning.
"
,,
4,27," That is not my prerogative, sir.
"
,,
4,27,"I wait in one line,

4,27,"they send me to another line...
"

4,27,"You can always call
"

4,27,"to make an appointment.
"
,,
4,27,"The line's always busy!
"

4,27,"That's ridiculous.
"

4,27," Wait in the appointment line.

4,27,"Peter, enough with the storytelling.

4,27,"We gotta get outta here!

4,27,"They're gonna kill Meg!

4,27,"Oh, yeah? Over Meg's dead body.
"
,,
4,27,"Hey! A flare gun.
"
,,
4,27,"Good idea, Peter.
"
,,
4,27,"If we angle it through the vent, we
"

4,27,"might be able to alert the authorities.
"
,,
4,27," Oh, my God! We're gonna drown!
"
,,
4,27," We'll be fine. Here, put these on.
"
,,
4,27,"Peter, these are parachutes.
"
,,
4,27,"What are we supposed to do with these?
"
,,
4,27,"They're supposed to distract you
"
,,
4,27,"while I put on the one scuba suit.
"
,,
4,27," What's the matter?
"
,,
4,27," That wasn't oxygen.
"
,,
4,27,"That was a tank of Tony Danza's breath.
"
,,
4,27,"I wonder who got my oxygen tank.
"
,,
4,27,"Kiss me, Tony.
"

4,27,"I want your breath inside me.
"

4,27,"Well, as long as death

4,27,"is staring us in the face,

4,27,"Will it, Dear?

4,27,"You gotta, Chris... you gotta...
"
,,
4,27,"It's important for you
"
,,
4,27,"to get an education!
"
,,
4,27,"Get in there and finish your homework!
"

4,27,"It was a simpler time.

4,27,"Well, no matter what happens to us,
"

4,27,"I just hope Meg's okay.

4,27," Oh, no! Oh!

,,
4,27,"She asked if we were gonna
"
,,
4,27,"have our way with her.
"
,,
4,27," No, seriously</i>
"

4,27," I won't scream or anything.
"

4,27," No! No! I... I...

4,27,"No. No sale.
"
,,
4,27,"Come on! I'm pretty!
"
,,
4,27," Are you okay?
"
,,
4,27," Yeah. I was so scared.
"
,,
4,27,"Well, it sure would suck
"
,,
4,27,"if you guys died
"
,,
4,27,"without hearing the story
"
,,
4,27,"of my great uncle, Peter Hitler,
"
,,
4,27,"who was Adolf's favorite brother.
"
,,
4,27,"Hey, there you are.
"

4,27,"Hey, you ready to go check out that new

4,27," Peter, can't you see I'm busy?
"
,,
4,27," Yeah. What are you doing?
"
,,
4,27," Stuff?
"
,,
4,27," Yes.
"
,,
4,27," Nazi stuff?
"
,,
4,27," Yes, Peter. Nazi stuff.
"
,,
4,27," Can I help?
"
,,
4,27," No, Peter.
"
,,
4,27," Just let me work, all right?!
"
,,
4,27," All right, all right. Okay.
"

"

4,27,"Sweet!
"
,,
4,27," That's what a gun sounds like.
"
,,
4,27," Will you stop that?!
"
,,
4,27,"Hey, can I borrow 50 marks?
"
,,
4,27,"What happened to the 50 marks
"
,,
4,27,"I gave you last week?
"
,,
4,27,"Aw, come on.
"
,,
4,27,"Your girlfriend's not cheap.
"
,,
4,27,"Just kidding.
"
,,
4,27,"Ah! Look at your face.
"
,,
4,27,"Hey, whatever happened
"
,,
4,27,"with that art school?
"
,,
4,27,"You ever gonna take
"
,,
4,27,"another crack at that?
"
,,
4,27,"Look, I'm going to do a rally.
"
,,
4,27,"I'll be back in an hour.
"
,,
4,27,"A rally. Sweet.
"
,,
4,27,"The days of despair
"
,,
4,27,"and hardship are over!
"
,,
4,27,"Today begins a New Order!
"
,,
4,27,"All of Europe will tremble
"
,,
4,27,"as Germany take sits rightful place
"
,,
4,27,"as ruler of the world!
"
,,
4,27,"Oh, yeah!
"
,,
4,27,"Yes. As I was saying,
"
,,
4,27,"the time for victory is upon us!
"
,,
4,27,"Victory up the ass, baby!
"
,,
4,27,"Yeah, come on!
"
,,
4,27,"A new... a new world! A better world!
"
,,
4,27," A German world!
"
,,
4,27," Yeah! Germanator!
"
,,
4,27,"I'll be back! Whoo! Yeah!
"
,,
4,27,"We will emerge as the dominant people!
"
,,
4,27,"And it's all 'cause of you guys.
"
,,
4,27,"You know what?
"
,,
4,27,"You guys, with your marching
"
,,
4,27,"and your letters and your phone calls,
"
,,
4,27,"this is all thanks to you.
"
,,
4,27,"You made this happen,
"
,,
4,27,"you guys... My God! Give yourselves
"
,,
4,27,"a round of applause! Come on.
"
,,
4,27,"You deserve it. You deserve it.
"
,,
4,27,"Hey, what do you say we all
"
,,
4,27,"head over to the Buzenpuken, eh?
"
,,
4,27,"Free beer on this motherfuhrer!
"
,,
4,27,"Eh?! Come on!
"
,,
4,27,"Well, that's pretty much
"
,,
4,27,"all there is to tell, kids.
"
,,
4,27,"The Griffin family history
"
,,
4,27,"is a rich tapestry.
"
,,
4,27,"But, since we're all gonna die,
"
,,
4,27,"there's one more secret
"
,,
4,27,"I feel I have to share with you:
"
,,
4,27,"I did not care for The Godfather.
"
,,
4,27," What?
"
,,
4,27," Did not care for The Godfather.
"
,,
4,27," How can you even say that, Dad?
"
,,
4,27," Didn't like... didn't like it.
"
,,
4,27,"Peter, it's so good.
"
,,
4,27,"It's like the perfect movie.
"
,,
4,27,"This is what everyone
"
,,
4,27,"always says whenever...
"
,,
4,27,"Robert De Niro, Al Pacino...
"
,,
4,27,"I mean, you never see...
"
,,
4,27,"Robert Duvall!
"
,,
4,27,"I know. Fine, fine actor.
"
,,
4,27,"Did not like the movie.
"
,,
4,27," Why not?
"
,,
4,27," Couldn't get into it.
"
,,
4,27,"Explain yourself.
"
,,
4,27,"What didn't you like about it?
"
,,
4,27," It insists upon itself, Lois.
"
,,
4,27," What?
"
,,
4,27," It insists upon itself.
"
,,
4,27," What does that even mean?
"
,,
4,27,"'Cause it has a valid point
"
,,
4,27,"to make, it's insistent!
"
,,
4,27,"It takes forever getting in, and then you
"
,,
4,27,"spend, like six and half hours, and then,
"
,,
4,27,"I can't even get through it.
"
,,
4,27,"I can't even finish the movie.
"
,,
4,27,"I've never even seen the ending.
"
,,
4,27," You've never seen the ending?!
"
,,
4,27," How can you say you don't like it
"
,,
4,27,"if you haven't even given it a chance?
"
,,
4,27,"I agree with Stewie.
"
,,
4,27,"It's not really fair.
"
,,
4,27,"I have tried, on three separate
"
,,
4,27,"occasions, to get through it, and I...
"
,,
4,27,"I get to the scene where all the guys
"
,,
4,27,"are sitting around on easy chairs...
"
,,
4,27,"Yeah. That's a great scene.
"
,,
4,27,"I love that scene.
"
,,
4,27,"It's noted in every annal.
"
,,
4,27,"I have no idea what
"
,,
4,27,"they're talking about.
"
,,
4,27,"Like they're speaking a different language.
"
,,
4,27,"That's why I lose interest and I go away.
"
,,
4,27,"They're speaking Italian!
"
,,
4,27,"The language they're speaking
"
,,
4,27,"is the language of subtlety,
"
,,
4,27,"something you don't understand.
"
,,
4,27,"I love The Money Pit.
"
,,
4,27,"That is my answer to that statement.
"
,,
4,27," Exactly.
"
,,
4,27," Well, there you go.
"
,,
4,27," Whatever.
"
,,
4,27," I like that movie, too.
"
,,
4,27,"Thank God, you guys are okay!
"
,,
4,27,"Wow! You saved our lives, Mr. Swanson!
"
,,
4,27," We've captured the burglars.
"
,,
4,27," Oh, thank God.
"
,,
4,27,"Unfortunately, they're pressing sexual
"
,,
4,27,"harassment charges against your daughter.
"
,,
4,27," Well, that was a close call.
"
,,
4,27," You know, uh...
"
,,
4,27,"Meg should probably get a lawyer.
"
,,
4,27,"Oh, sweetie, thank you for keeping
"
,,
4,27,"our spirits up with your stories.
"
,,
4,27,"Your daughter's a sexual predator.
"
,,
4,27,"If you don't do anything,
"
,,
4,27,"she could go to jail for a long time.
"
,,
4,27,"Don't thank me, Lois. Thank my
"
,,
4,27,"ancestors for living lives of greatness.
"
,,
4,27," All right, guys, just take her away.
"
,,
4,27," Dad, help!
"
,,
4,27," Dad!
"
,,
4,27," Have fun at the dance, Meg.
"
,,
4,27,"I hope she does.
"
,,
4,27,"That kid really deserves it.

"

5,1,"Oh, that's me, I'm, uh, I'm Peter Griffin.
"

5,1,"Mr. Griffin, these flu shots
"

5,1,"are in short supply.
"

5,1,"We need to save them for the elderly.
"

5,1," Like these folks here.
"

5,1," Hmm, well, this is odd.

5,1," What?
"

5,1,"Well, you're 42 years old and it says
"

"
,,
5,1,"No, but I've had other exams.
"

5,1,"Like that one in college.
"

"

"

5,1,"All right, Mr. Griffin, I'm just going

5,1,"and we'll check your prostate.
"

5,1,"Uh, what?
"
,,
5,1,"Drop your pants, turn around,
"

"

5,1," Get away from me!

5,1,"Wh-What?
"
,,
5,1,"Peter, that's a prostate exam.
"
,,
5,1,"It's an important part of a
"
,,
5,1,"physical for men your age.
"
,,
5,1,"You sound just like him!
"
,,
5,1,"( bleep ) idiot.
"
,,
5,1,"Hey, Peter, buddy.
"
,,
5,1,"How 'bout some TV, huh?
"
,,
5,1,"Freddy got fingered.</i>
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, God.
"
,,
5,1," Oh, God.
"
,,
5,1,"Are we still going to the baseball game?
"
,,
5,1,"Get that away from me, Chris.
"
,,
5,1,"Stop it, Meg.
"
,,
5,1,"Peter...
"
,,
5,1,"I'm trying to be supportive
"
,,
5,1,"but after all, it was just a prostate exam.
"
,,
5,1,"You weren't there, Lois.
"
,,
5,1,"You weren't there.
"
,,
5,1,"Who's that?
"
,,
5,1,"Who are you?
"
,,
5,1,"Where's Peter?
"
,,
5,1,"Where is he?
"
,,
5,1,"You're a whore.
"
,,
5,1,"Wear your whore makeup, you whore.
"
,,
5,1," Is somebody in there?
"
,,
5,1," Ocupado.
"
,,
5,1,"Filthy whore.
"
,,
5,1,"You're somebody's father, you filthy whore.
"
,,
5,1," Hi, sweetie.
"
,,
5,1," Ugh, look at her staring.
"
,,
5,1,"What are you looking at, huh?
"
,,
5,1,"God, I should take her out right here
"
,,
5,1,"with these, man.
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, hey, Lois. Oh, you like staring?
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, why don't I give you a closer look?
"
,,
5,1,"Yeah, you want some of this,
"
,,
5,1,"Maury Po-bitch?
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, oh, what's that, oh,
"
,,
5,1,"you come back for more, huh?
"
,,
5,1,"I'd freakin' drop her ass.
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, an unfamiliar dog.
"
,,
5,1,"Why don't you go away?
"
,,
5,1,"I don't want to be your friend.
"
,,
5,1,"Rupert!
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, dear God, somebody help!
"
,,
5,1,"Rupert!
"
,,
5,1,"Give me that bear!
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, honey, I'm afraid
"
,,
5,1,"Rupert had a little injury.
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, Rupert, please live.
"
,,
5,1,"Please, I'll never be short with you again.
"
,,
5,1,"W-We'll go away. W-We'll go to Hawaii.
"
,,
5,1,"Would you like that?
"
,,
5,1,"I always envisioned how it would be.
"
,,
5,1,"I never knew there could be
"
,,
5,1,"such a thing as a perfect day.
"
,,
5,1,"Don't frolic too much, Rupert.
"
,,
5,1,"Save some energy for the hula contest.
"
,,
5,1,"Stewie, I have a surprise for you.
"
,,
5,1,"Good as new.
"
,,
5,1,"Rupert, it's really him.
"
,,
5,1,"I don't believe it.
"
,,
5,1,"You-you did this for me?
"
,,
5,1,"And to help you feel better,
"
,,
5,1,"I made your favorite dinner.
"
,,
5,1,"Cut green beans...
"
,,
5,1,"Atkins-friendly potato sticks arranged
"
,,
5,1,"according to size from largest to smallest,
"
,,
5,1,"and a Scooby-Doo yogurt with
"
,,
5,1,"Shaggy's eyes scratched out.
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, it's perfect down to the last detail.
"
,,
5,1,"Lois, I was wrong about you.
"
,,
5,1,"You're...
"
,,
5,1,"you're my everything.
"
,,
5,1,"Mommy loves you, sweetheart.
"
,,
5,1,"Stewie loves Lois.
"
,,
5,1,"Brian loves Olympia Dukakis.
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, yeah, I do.
"
,,
5,1,"Peter, what's the matter with you today?
"
,,
5,1,"You're not yourself.
"
,,
5,1,"Guys, I went to Dr. Hartman
"
,,
5,1,"yesterday and...
"
,,
5,1,"he did things to my fanny.
"
,,
5,1," Peter, it's okay.
"
,,
5,1," It's not okay.
"
,,
5,1," You don't know what it's like.
"
,,
5,1," You're wrong.
"
,,
5,1,"I, too, have felt the cold finger of injustice
"
,,
5,1,"on my insidey parts.
"
,,
5,1,"He did it to you, too?
"
,,
5,1,"I have something to say.
"
,,
5,1,"Dr. Hartman violated me, as well.
"
,,
5,1,"I only went in there
"
,,
5,1,"for a physical-slash-guinea pig sremoval,
"
,,
5,1,"but I turned out to be the guinea pig,
"
,,
5,1,"for a sexual experimentation.
"
,,
5,1,"You guys are a bunch of queers.
"
,,
5,1,"And so am I!
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, God, it was horrible!
"
,,
5,1,"I scrubbed and I scrubbed, but damn it,
"
,,
5,1,"they don't make water hot enough!
"
,,
5,1,"My God, we've all been victims
"
,,
5,1,"of Dr. Hartman's ""prostate exam.""
"
,,
5,1,"Well, gentlemen, the abuse stops here.
"
,,
5,1,"I will not turn a brown eye to this.
"
,,
5,1,"I am going to sue that bastard
"
,,
5,1,"and make him pay out the ass.
"
,,
5,1,"No ifs, ands, or buts.
"
,,
5,1,"I'm going to be really anal about this.
"
,,
5,1,"Sphincter.
"
,,
5,1,"Good morning, Lois.
"
,,
5,1,"My, Stewie, you're in a good mood today.
"
,,
5,1,"Well, why shouldn't I be?
"
,,
5,1,"You saved Rupert's life and I love you for it.
"
,,
5,1,"So warn the villagers,
"
,,
5,1,"here comes the cuddle monster.
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, Lois, your breasts are great.
"
,,
5,1,"Well, good morning, Mr. Nipple.
"
,,
5,1,"Hey, there.
"
,,
5,1,"Must be cold in here.
"
,,
5,1,"Peter, you're going to sue Dr. Hartman?
"
,,
5,1,"You can't do that, all he did was
"
,,
5,1,"give you a prostate exam.
"
,,
5,1,"Are you saying I asked
"
,,
5,1,"for this to happen?
"
,,
5,1,"You know, Dad, there's this lawyer at
"
,,
5,1,"the mall who says he'll take any case,
"
,,
5,1," no matter how frivolous.
"
,,
5,1," Yeah, yeah...
"
,,
5,1,"and-and they also have an Orange Julius.
"
,,
5,1,"Just-just trying to keep
"
,,
5,1,"the conversation going.
"
,,
5,1,"Well, whatever happens,
"
,,
5,1,"I'm not going to stand for this.
"
,,
5,1,"Too many people get away with injustice.
"
,,
5,1,"Like the folks you meetin
"
,,
5,1,"those Louisiana swamps.
"
,,
5,1,"Excuse me,
"
,,
5,1,"do you know how to get to town?
"
,,
5,1,"Yeah, it's back the way you came.
"
,,
5,1,"I love you, Lois.
"
,,
5,1,"You know that, right?
"
,,
5,1,"Just in case, I'll say it again.
"
,,
5,1,"I love you.
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, you are just so cute, sweetie.
"
,,
5,1,"Look at that little foot.
"
,,
5,1,"I'm gonna eat that foot.
"
,,
5,1,"Give me that foot, it looks delicious.
"
,,
5,1,"Don't-don't eat my foot.
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, God.
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, it is so hard to find funny women,
"
,,
5,1,"and you are hilarious.
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, you're like a female Bonnie Hunt.
"
,,
5,1,"Sit right there, honey. Mommy'll go get
"
,,
5,1,"Rupert so he can eat with you.
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, God. Thoughtful.
"
,,
5,1," Lois, I made coffee if you want some.
"
,,
5,1," Oh, thank you, Brian. That'd be nice.
"
,,
5,1,"Uh, hey, Brian.
"
,,
5,1,"Uh, listen, I've got a favor to ask.
"
,,
5,1,"Could you, uh, could you
"
,,
5,1,"not talk to Lois anymore?
"
,,
5,1,"What?
"
,,
5,1,"You know, it's just I'm tired of you
"
,,
5,1,"hitting on her. That's all, it's-it's not cool.
"
,,
5,1,"I was just making coffee.
"
,,
5,1,"I didn't hit on her.
"
,,
5,1,"Besides, Lois is my friend.
"
,,
5,1,"I'll do whatever the hell I want.
"
,,
5,1,"I'm asking you nicely, Brian.
"
,,
5,1,"Stop hitting on her.
"
,,
5,1," That's ridiculous.
"
,,
5,1," I see the way you look at her.
"
,,
5,1,"Sorry, I fell asleep watching
"
,,
5,1,"Sabado Gigante last night.
"
,,
5,1,"Chiste grande.
"
,,
5,1,"Lois, you know what
"
,,
5,1,"we should do right now?
"
,,
5,1,"We should play restaurant
"
,,
5,1,"with my Play-Doh.
"
,,
5,1,"I'll make you a hamburger.
"
,,
5,1,"Perhaps I'll make it blue.
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, can you imagine such a world?
"
,,
5,1,"Uh, Stewie, I love you,
"
,,
5,1,"but you're wearing Mommy out.
"
,,
5,1," Now it's time for bed.
"
,,
5,1," Hey, Lois, I have a secret for you.
"
,,
5,1,"You're awesome.
"
,,
5,1,"Our top story : a local woman
"
,,
5,1,"loses her sex drive
"
,,
5,1,"after a $125 dinner at Alfredo's.
"
,,
5,1,"But first in medical news, Dr. Elmer Hartman,
"
,,
5,1,"beloved family doctor to all of Quahog,
"
,,
5,1,"is the target of a molestation lawsuit.
"
,,
5,1,"The trial is set to begin tomorrow.
"
,,
5,1,"We now return you to
"
,,
5,1,"Native American What's Happening!
"
,,
5,1,"Hey, Rerun, you see Dwayne?
"
,,
5,1,"Not today.
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, here he come.
"
,,
5,1,"How, how, how.
"
,,
5,1,"Peter, I don't know
"
,,
5,1,"how much more I can take.
"
,,
5,1,"Stewie used to be so independent,
"
,,
5,1,"but now he just clings to me night and day.
"
,,
5,1,"I'm exhausted.
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, look at me, I'm Lois.
"
,,
5,1,"The sun revolves around me.
"
,,
5,1,"I'm the one who's got
"
,,
5,1,"to go to court tomorrow.
"
,,
5,1,"Peter, isn't there anything I can do
"
,,
5,1,"to talk you out of this lawsuit?
"
,,
5,1,"Hey, I was violated sexually
"
,,
5,1,"and that man is going to pay.
"
,,
5,1,"And I suppose it wouldn't matter
"
,,
5,1,"if I told you for the 50th time
"
,,
5,1,"that it's a legitimate medical
"
,,
5,1,"procedure to test for cancer.
"
,,
5,1,"Lois.
"

"

5,1,"Lois.

"
,,
5,1," Mum-ma.
"
,,
5,1," What?!
"
,,
5,1,"Hi.
"
,,
5,1,"Is it not true that you went
"
,,
5,1,"to see Dr. Hartman
"
,,
5,1,"for a simple prostate exam?
"
,,
5,1,"No, I went for a flu shot.
"
,,
5,1,"At first, I thought he was nice
"
,,
5,1,"and that he was kind of handsome.
"
,,
5,1,"I trusted him
"
,,
5,1,"and then, he told me to bend over.
"
,,
5,1,"And then, I just felt like something was wrong.
"
,,
5,1,"I tried to get him to stop,
"
,,
5,1,"but he kept saying,
"
,,
5,1,"""Relax, I'm a doctor.""
"
,,
5,1," This is ridiculous, that never happened.
"
,,
5,1," Sit down, you rapist!
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm supposed to wait
"
,,
5,1,"until I've heard everything.
"
,,
5,1,"Go ahead, Mr. Griffin.
"
,,
5,1,"And that's when things got bad.
"
,,
5,1,"He made me feel so dirty.
"
,,
5,1,"Relax...
"
,,
5,1,"I'm a doctor.
"
,,
5,1,"Your Honor, I can't believe
"
,,
5,1,"you're even listening to this.
"
,,
5,1,"For God's sake, you're a patient of mine.
"
,,
5,1,"I gave you a prostate exam last year,
"
,,
5,1,"don't you remember?
"
,,
5,1,"Come to think of it,
"
,,
5,1,"I remember it as a pretty standard exam.
"
,,
5,1,"Are you sure, Judge?
"
,,
5,1,"Are you sure it wasn't all evil and grainy
"
,,
5,1,"and black and white? Think about it.
"
,,
5,1,"Relax.
"
,,
5,1,"I be a doctor.
"
,,
5,1,"Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty!
"
,,
5,1,"Dr. Hartman, your medical license
"
,,
5,1,"is hereby revoked.
"
,,
5,1,"That's outrageous!
"
,,
5,1,"God, I've looked forward to this moment
"
,,
5,1,"more than the second coming of Jesus.
"
,,
5,1,"Okay, everybody, uh,
"
,,
5,1,"I know you were expecting something else,
"
,,
5,1,"but as science will tell you,
"
,,
5,1,"people were a lot shorter 2,000 years ago.
"
,,
5,1,"So let's try to be adult about this.
"
,,
5,1,"Uh, no snickering and... Hey!
"
,,
5,1,"That's exactly what I'm talking about.
"
,,
5,1,"Okay, so if we can all be mature...
"
,,
5,1,"give me the gum,
"
,,
5,1,"we can all get through this a lot faster.
"
,,
5,1,"I have so much fun
"
,,
5,1,"when we hang out, Lois,
"
,,
5,1,"and I love your hair.
"
,,
5,1,"We should make up a name
"
,,
5,1,"for your hair color.
"
,,
5,1,"We could call it, like, like,
"
,,
5,1,"strawberry sunset
"
,,
5,1,"or ginger maiden,
"
,,
5,1,"o-o-or-or one of those hair color names
"
,,
5,1,"that's a random noun, like
"
,,
5,1,"like temptress.
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, at some point,
"
,,
5,1,"you have to let me braid it!
"
,,
5,1,"Lois, what are you doing?
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, my God.
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, my God, what's happening to me?
"
,,
5,1,"I'm like that Texas woman
"
,,
5,1,"who gave her son brain damage
"
,,
5,1,"by holding him underwater.
"
,,
5,1,"I'm just like Barbara Bush!
"
,,
5,1,"Brian, what kind of a mother
"
,,
5,1,"has homicidal thoughts
"
,,
5,1,"about her own baby?
"
,,
5,1,"I'm a horrible person.
"
,,
5,1,"Lois, you're just exhausted.
"
,,
5,1,"Somehow, you've got to break Stewie
"
,,
5,1,"of this new over dependence on you.
"
,,
5,1,"Well, it's worth a try.
"
,,
5,1,"Lois, I've got a surprise for you.
"
,,
5,1,"You and I are going to see Eddie Money!
"
,,
5,1,"Two tickets, won'em on the radio.
"
,,
5,1,"We're gonna have a ball.
"
,,
5,1,"God, he's like a totally different person,
"
,,
5,1,"like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Sulu.
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, no, I never should have
"
,,
5,1,"drank those chemicals.
"
,,
5,1,"Hello.
"
,,
5,1,"Peter, congratulations on taking down
"
,,
5,1,"that monster Dr. Hartman.
"
,,
5,1,"Yeah, what'd you do with
"
,,
5,1,"your pain and suffering money?
"
,,
5,1,"I got collagen.
"
,,
5,1,"Hey, Lois, want to make out?
"
,,
5,1,"Yeah, what do you think
"
,,
5,1,"of new sexy lips Peter?
"
,,
5,1,"Yeah.
"
,,
5,1,"This is your life from now on.
"
,,
5,1,"Enjoy it, lucky wife.
"
,,
5,1,"I tell you, boys, this is a victory
"
,,
5,1,"not just for my anus but for anuses...
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, hang on, I got to go pee.
"
,,
5,1,"That's a lot better. So, anyway, this is a...
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, I got to take a leak.
"
,,
5,1,"There we go.
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, pee time.
"
,,
5,1,"Peter, you're urinating unusually frequently.
"
,,
5,1,"Yeah, what gives?
"
,,
5,1,"If it's gale-force peeing you be doing,
"
,,
5,1,"it could mean you've got
"
,,
5,1,"barnacles on your prostate.
"
,,
5,1,"Best have sick bay check below your decks.
"
,,
5,1,"Wait a minute. Are you telling me
"
,,
5,1,"I need a prostate exam?
"
,,
5,1,"Aye, and soon,
"
,,
5,1,"before your rudder jams with flotsam
"
,,
5,1,"and you're dropping anchor
"
,,
5,1,"without an order from the captain.
"
,,
5,1,"How are you liking
"
,,
5,1,"all these nautical puns?
"
,,
5,1," Cute. - Not bad.
"
,,
5,1," Somewhat entertaining.
"
,,
5,1,"My God, I'd better see a doctor.
"
,,
5,1,"But no doctor in town
"
,,
5,1,"will see you after that lawsuit.
"
,,
5,1,"Well, then, I'll just find
"
,,
5,1,"a doctor out of town.
"
,,
5,1,"Listen, uh, I know
"
,,
5,1,"I'm not a regular patient,
"
,,
5,1,"but I think I have some
"
,,
5,1,"trouble with my prostate.
"
,,
5,1," So can you help me out, Dr. McCoy?
"
,,
5,1," What, so you can sue me, too?
"
,,
5,1," Oh, come on, it'll only take a sec.
"
,,
5,1," Forget it. I'm a doctor, not a patsy.
"
,,
5,1,"Hello.
"
,,
5,1,"Lois, what are you doing?
"
,,
5,1,"I want to sleep in your bed.
"
,,
5,1,"Good night, honey.
"
,,
5,1,"I love you.
"
,,
5,1,"This is for your own good.
"
,,
5,1,"Lois, wh-wh-where are you going?
"
,,
5,1,"Lois... Lois.
"
,,
5,1,"Lois, answer me!
"
,,
5,1,"Damn you, I will not be ignored!
"
,,
5,1,"Get back in here!
"
,,
5,1,"Get back in here and love me!
"
,,
5,1,"Lois!
"
,,
5,1,"Maybe I should go in. He's so upset.
"
,,
5,1,"He's just being melodramatic. You've got
"
,,
5,1,"to ignore it if you really want to help him.
"
,,
5,1," Are you flexing?
"
,,
5,1," What, me?
"
,,
5,1,"Ha, no.
"
,,
5,1,"Wha... why-why would I be flexing?
"
,,
5,1,"I mean, I have, uh,
"
,,
5,1,"sort of been hitting the gym,
"
,,
5,1,"so uh, if-if you wanted
"
,,
5,1,"to see how it's going...
"
,,
5,1,"What am I going to do, Seamus?
"
,,
5,1,"Dr. Hartman is my only hope,
"
,,
5,1,"and there's no way he's going to see me.
"
,,
5,1,"Well, you best come up
"
,,
5,1,"with something, Peter.
"
,,
5,1,"Otherwise, this will happen
"
,,
5,1,"to your prostate.
"
,,
5,1,"You just, uh, carry a picture
"
,,
5,1,"of a diseased prostate around with you?
"
,,
5,1,"Never know when it's going
"
,,
5,1,"to come up in conversation
"
,,
5,1,"and then, who's the
"
,,
5,1,"one who's prepared?
"
,,
5,1,"I've also got a map of Middle Earth,
"
,,
5,1,"a cat doing a pull-up,
"
,,
5,1,"and the guys from Primus.
"
,,
5,1,"These poster jokes
"
,,
5,1,"doing anything for you?
"
,,
5,1," Eh, hit and miss.
"
,,
5,1," We should hang out more.
"
,,
5,1,"I need her love.
"
,,
5,1,"I need her love, and she's ignoring me.
"
,,
5,1,"Well, let's see her try to ignore this.
"
,,
5,1,"Lois, help!
"
,,
5,1,"I ate this whole jar of pills that
"
,,
5,1,"look like candy and now I feel sick.
"
,,
5,1," You look like a jackass.
"
,,
5,1," Can't hear you, Brian. I'm dead.
"
,,
5,1,"All right.
"
,,
5,1,"What did you do?
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, that is so not cool.
"
,,
5,1,"Mommy, I'm dying!
"
,,
5,1,"I'm dying!
"
,,
5,1,"I said I'm dying!
"
,,
5,1,"Hey!
"
,,
5,1,"I'm dyin'up here.
"
,,
5,1,"What is this? A Tommy Lee pool party?
"
,,
5,1,"Come on, Lois, get with the...
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, my God.
"
,,
5,1,"Stewie, are you all right?
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, my sweet baby.
"
,,
5,1,"And to think I ignored your cries
"
,,
5,1,"for attention. I'm so sorry, honey.
"
,,
5,1,"Never again, Stewie. I'm going to give
"
,,
5,1,"you all the love you could ever want.
"
,,
5,1,"Forget it, you neglectful,
"
,,
5,1,"swag-bellied measle.
"
,,
5,1,"You had your chance and you blew it.
"
,,
5,1,"Well, now you're too late.
"
,,
5,1,"I hope they charge you with
"
,,
5,1,"child abuse for my broken arm.
"
,,
5,1,"I'll testify against you
"
,,
5,1,"just like I did against Michael Jackson.
"
,,
5,1,"Stewie, did Mr. Jackson behave
"
,,
5,1,"inappropriately toward you?
"
,,
5,1,"Well, yes, but the worst part
"
,,
5,1,"was he never called back.
"
,,
5,1,"No, but in all seriousness, yeah,
"
,,
5,1,"he was actually pretty aggressive.
"
,,
5,1," Uh, package for Dr. Hartman?
"
,,
5,1," All right, where's the package?
"
,,
5,1,"Here it is.
"
,,
5,1,"Uh, so why don't you go ahead and
"
,,
5,1,"open it up and reach on in there?
"
,,
5,1,"It's probably cookies or something.
"
,,
5,1,"Wait a minute, there's
"
,,
5,1,"something strange about this.
"
,,
5,1,"I wasn't expecting any package.
"
,,
5,1,"Who are you?
"
,,
5,1,"Griffin!
"
,,
5,1,"You got to help me, Dr. Hartman.
"
,,
5,1,"I think there may actually be
"
,,
5,1,"something wrong with my prostate.
"
,,
5,1,"Well, don't look at me.
"
,,
5,1,"I lost my license, thanks to you.
"
,,
5,1,"Look, I-I know what I did was wrong, but
"
,,
5,1,"you're the only one I can turn to.
"
,,
5,1,"So, I'm asking you...
"
,,
5,1,"as a man with no more options...
"
,,
5,1,"will you take a look in my ass?
"
,,
5,1,"Despite everything that's happened,
"
,,
5,1,"I suppose I can't ignore
"
,,
5,1,"my Hippocratic oath.
"
,,
5,1,"All right, drop your pants.
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, well, this is nothing. Just a little
"
,,
5,1,"swelling. Probably a minor infection.
"
,,
5,1,"Looks like there's some blockage.
"
,,
5,1,"What the devil is that?
"
,,
5,1,"Dr. Hartman,
"
,,
5,1,"your license is hereby reinstated.
"
,,
5,1,"Oh, I'm so glad you two
"
,,
5,1,"worked things out.
"
,,
5,1,"And to think I actually thought
"
,,
5,1,"you raped me.
"
,,
5,1,"Well, I was going to,
"
,,
5,1,"but you ran out of the room.

"

5,2,"Oh, my God,
"
,,
5,2,"where's Stewie?
"
,,
5,2,"Don't panic, Lois, we'll find him.
"
,,
5,2,"I'm good at picking
"

5,2,"people out of a crowd.
"
,,
5,2,"Oh, gosh, this is hard.
"

5,2,"Um, yeah, could I get
"

5,2,"a better look at number two?
"
,,
5,2,"And, number four
"
,,
5,2,"could you step forward, too?
"
,,
5,2,"Okay, uh, number five,
"
,,
5,2,"uh, look at number one.
"

5,2,"not too happy.

"
,,
5,2,"Hey, everybody,
"
,,
5,2,"it's Weenie and the Butt here
"
,,
5,2,"live at the Quahog Air Show.
"
,,
5,2,"We're all ready for
"
,,
5,2,"the Weenie sound-alike contest.
"
,,
5,2,"I don't know, Butt,
"
,,
5,2,"I don't think they can say my
"
,,
5,2,"catchphrase, because...
"
,,
5,2,"""They no funny!""
"
,,
5,2,"Oh, there it is!
"
,,
5,2,"And if you think you can say
"
,,
5,2,"that just like Weenie here,
"
,,
5,2,"you could win 97.1 dollars

,,
5,2,"for the cool weekend ahead.

5,2,"with Weenie and the Butt.</i>
"
,,
5,2," Ninety-seven point one!</i>
"

5,2,"And welcome back.
"
,,
5,2,"Uh, excuse I-I got to find a lost kid.
"
,,
5,2,"Can I use your mic?
"
,,
5,2,"That's what she said.
"
,,
5,2,"Whoa, you got Butt-slammed!
"
,,
5,2,"Listen, I could really
"
,,
5,2,"use a hand here.
"
,,
5,2,"That's what he said!
"
,,
5,2,"Butt slam!
"
,,
5,2,"That's Manic Monkey on 97.1.
"
,,
5,2,"Gimme that.
"
,,
5,2,"Stewie Griffin, will you please
"
,,
5,2,"report to the radio booth.
"
,,
5,2,"Stewie Griffin.
"
,,
5,2,"Hey, that's quite
"
,,
5,2,"a voice you've got there.
"
,,
5,2,"You ever think about doing radio?
"
,,
5,2,"Well, uh, I listen to a lot of radio.
"
,,
5,2,"Peter and Lois leave the radio on
"
,,
5,2,"when they go out
"
,,
5,2,"so I feel like somebody's home.
"
,,
5,2,"Well, here's my card.
"
,,
5,2,"Call me if you're interested.
"
,,
5,2,"Hey, okay, we've got
"
,,
5,2,"our first contestant.
"
,,
5,2,"Let's hear Weenie's catchphrase.
"
,,
5,2,"They no funny.

,,
5,2,"I think we have a wee-ner.
"
,,
5,2,"And that's Dicky the Punchline Donkey,
"
,,
5,2,"on 97.1.
"
,,
5,2,"And now back to Round Table,
"
,,
5,2,"with Al Michaels,
"
,,
5,2,"Harold Ramis, Ray Romano,
"
,,
5,2,"and Kermit the Frog.
"
,,
5,2,"There zoning laws are infringing
"
,,
5,2,"on the rights of citizens...
"
,,
5,2,"Uh, if I might interrupt for a minute,
"
,,
5,2,"I'd like to point out that--
"
,,
5,2,"You've had your time.
"
,,
5,2,"Let someone else speak.
"
,,
5,2,"I haven't said a word. It was that guy.
"
,,
5,2,"Don't look at me, I can't get
"
,,
5,2,"a word in edgewise.
"
,,
5,2,"Well, then who the hell's
"
,,
5,2,"been talking this whole time?
"
,,
5,2,"Thelma!
"
,,
5,2,"Hello, darling.
"
,,
5,2,"Oh, my God, what
"
,,
5,2,"a pleasant surprise.
"
,,
5,2,"Mom, what are you doing here?
"
,,
5,2,"Peter, I left your father.
"
,,
5,2,"What?
"
,,
5,2,"Wait, wait, wait, hang on a second.
"
,,
5,2,"I never see you, and then
"
,,
5,2,"you finally come visit me
"
,,
5,2,"and you drop a bombshell like this?
"
,,
5,2,"This is just like what happened
"
,,
5,2,"at the Peanuts reunion.
"
,,
5,2,"Stupid song!
"
,,
5,2,"What are you looking at?
"
,,
5,2,"Yeah, it's me.
"
,,
5,2,"Your old punching bag,
"
,,
5,2,"Charlie Brown.
"
,,
5,2,"Everybody wish Snoopy was here
"
,,
5,2,"and Woodstock?
"
,,
5,2,"Everybody wish Snoopy
"
,,
5,2,"and Woodstock was here?
"
,,
5,2,"Well, they're dead!
"
,,
5,2,"And guess what?
"
,,
5,2,"I sold Snoopy the junk.
"
,,
5,2,"That's right, he got it from me!
"
,,
5,2,"I swear I didn't know
"
,,
5,2,"how strong it was.
"
,,
5,2,"And now he's dead!
"
,,
5,2,"They're both dead!
"
,,
5,2,"I don't give a crap
"
,,
5,2,"about Woodstock,
"
,,
5,2,"but Snoopy...
"
,,
5,2,"Get off me, you skank!
"
,,
5,2,"I can't believe you left Dad.
"
,,
5,2,"I have needs that he didn't satisfy.
"
,,
5,2,"And I'm still a young woman, Peter.
"
,,
5,2,"I'm putting my fine ass
"
,,
5,2,"back on the market.
"
,,
5,2,"Boy, this is really going
"
,,
5,2,"to upset my evil brother, Thaddeus.
"
,,
5,2,"Nyah... this will surely affect
"
,,
5,2,"my inheritance... nyah.
"
,,
5,2,"Hi, I'm Brian Griffin,
"
,,
5,2,"and you're listening to The Lunch Hour,
"
,,
5,2,"serving up food for the mind.
"
,,
5,2,"Today's entree is politics.
"
,,
5,2,"What's on your mind today?
"
,,
5,2,"The governor's budget,
"
,,
5,2,"stem cell research?
"
,,
5,2,"Give us a hot spoonful
"
,,
5,2,"of your opinion.
"
,,
5,2,"Ok, we have a question from Quahog.
"
,,
5,2,"Caller, you're on The Lunch Hour.
"
,,
5,2,"Can I take your order?
"
,,
5,2,"Yes, uh, I'll have a big helping
"
,,
5,2,"of the pretentious crap.
"
,,
5,2,"Whoa, sometimes the, uh,
"
,,
5,2,"crazy ones get through.
"
,,
5,2,"Okay, we have Rose,
"
,,
5,2,"from Cranston, on the phone.
"
,,
5,2,"Welcome, Rose, can I take your order?
"
,,
5,2,"Um, yes, that turkey, that-
"
,,
5,2,"that raw turkey that you ate
"
,,
5,2,"off the counter last week
"
,,
5,2,"that got Lois mad,
"
,,
5,2,"when you pooped that out
"
,,
5,2,"was the timer still in there?
"
,,
5,2,"And we're out of time.
"
,,
5,2,"This has been The Lunch Hour.
"
,,
5,2,"Join us next week, when our
"
,,
5,2,"guest will be Gore Vidal.
"
,,
5,2,"And remember, life is full of entrees,
"
,,
5,2,"so don't fill up on bread.
"
,,
5,2,"I'm going to throw you now
"
,,
5,2,"to Weenie and The Butt
"
,,
5,2,"in the afternoon.
"
,,
5,2,"Sir, I'm very sorry.
"
,,
5,2,"That-that was this guy I know.
"
,,
5,2,"He thinks he's hilarious.
"
,,
5,2,"He is hilarious!
"
,,
5,2,"I was on my way in here
"
,,
5,2,"to cancel your show,
"
,,
5,2,"but the banter you did
"
,,
5,2,"with that guy,
"
,,
5,2,"well, as we say
"
,,
5,2,"in the radio business,
"
,,
5,2,"""If you put that on the radio,
"
,,
5,2,"people will listen to it!""
"
,,
5,2,"Make him part of the show.
"
,,
5,2,"Oh, you-you don't want him.
"
,,
5,2,"He's not really a professional like me.
"
,,
5,2,"Listen, you get that kid in here.
"
,,
5,2,"We need more laughs on the show.
"
,,
5,2,"Well, I guess he couldn't be any worse
"
,,
5,2,"than Tim McCarver is at sportscasting.
"
,,
5,2,"In my view, as good as the Yankees
"
,,
5,2,"were in the first half of this game,
"
,,
5,2,"that's how as bad they've been now.
"
,,
5,2,"Poor Peter, I know he's having
"
,,
5,2,"a hard time with this 
"
,,
5,2,"whole divorce thing.
"
,,
5,2,"I feel kind of guilty that
"
,,
5,2,"I'm here looking for a date.
"
,,
5,2,"Thelma, stop that.
"
,,
5,2,"You have a right to be happy.
"
,,
5,2,"And-and there's a lot of great people here
"
,,
5,2,"Why don't you mingle?
"
,,
5,2,"Oh, my God, Lois, you single now?!
"
,,
5,2,"No, Glen, I'm here with Thelma.
"
,,
5,2," Who's Thelma?
"
,,
5,2," This is Thelma.
"
,,
5,2,"I don't know if this
"
,,
5,2,"is gonna work, Lois.
"
,,
5,2,"I'm a little shy at these types of things.
"
,,
5,2,"Oh, you can overcome shyness.
"
,,
5,2,"Think of the spider in Charlotte's Web
"
,,
5,2,"who had to overcome Tourette's.
"
,,
5,2,"I don't know, Lois.
"
,,
5,2,"I haven't met a single
"
,,
5,2,"interesting person.
"
,,
5,2,"Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker
"
,,
5,2,"trying to get back on my feet
"
,,
5,2,"after having my ass handed to me
"
,,
5,2,"by my bitch of an ex-wife.
"
,,
5,2,"I'm Thelma.
"
,,
5,2,"I'll just be going.
"
,,
5,2,"Can I get you some punch?
"
,,
5,2,"Oh, no, you see, if you're one
"
,,
5,2,"of ten million Americans like me...
"
,,
5,2,"Like me.
"
,,
5,2,"Like me.
"
,,
5,2,"...with a bladder control problem,
"
,,
5,2,"punch just goes right through you.
"
,,
5,2,"I didn't hear you come in last night.
"
,,
5,2,"Did you have a good time
"
,,
5,2,"at your prostitutes convention?
"
,,
5,2,"Peter, I was just trying to help your
"
,,
5,2,"mother meet some new friends.
"
,,
5,2,"Lois, you're too nosey.
"
,,
5,2,"Like that waiter at that restaurant.
"
,,
5,2,"And who had the prime rib?
"
,,
5,2,"I hardly think that's any
"
,,
5,2,"of your business.
"
,,
5,2,"Come on, Mom,
"
,,
5,2,"you can't stay in bed all day.
"
,,
5,2,"You got to call dad and get
"
,,
5,2,"back together with...
"
,,
5,2,"Holy crap!
"
,,
5,2,"We'll have more on these
"
,,
5,2,"new developments after this.
"
,,
5,2,"I can't believe what I saw in there.
"
,,
5,2,"You were messing around
"
,,
5,2,"in what was basically
"
,,
5,2,"my first apartment.
"
,,
5,2,"Peter, you should be happy for her.
"
,,
5,2,"She's just having fun.
"
,,
5,2,"I don't see what the problem is.
"
,,
5,2,"Tom is a wonderful man.
"
,,
5,2,"I don't see the problem, either,
"
,,
5,2,"but let's go to Ollie Williams
"
,,
5,2,"for the inepth analysis. Ollie?
"
,,
5,2,"Lady's old!
"
,,
5,2,"Thanks, Ollie, over to you, Peter.
"
,,
5,2,"Tom Tucker, I forbid you
"
,,
5,2,"to see my mother.
"
,,
5,2,"Peter, you can't talk to Tom that way.
"
,,
5,2,"He won a local Emmy for his work
"
,,
5,2,"with the retardeds.
"
,,
5,2,"They certainly wanted to hug me.
"
,,
5,2,"Maybe in time, you will, too.
"
,,
5,2,"Thanks for watching, I'm Tom Tucker.
"
,,
5,2,"Good night.
"
,,
5,2,"All right, look, let's get
"
,,
5,2,"one thing straight, Stewie.
"
,,
5,2,"The only reason you're here
"
,,
5,2,"is that my boss ordered me
"
,,
5,2,"to bring you on.
"
,,
5,2,"All right, this is my show,
"
,,
5,2,"and it's a serious,
"
,,
5,2,"intellectual hour of discussion and
"
,,
5,2,"I want to keep it that way.
"
,,
5,2,"Hey, no problem.
"
,,
5,2,"All right, in three, two, one...
"
,,
5,2,"This is The Lunch Hour with your host...
"
,,
5,2,"Hey, what's up Quahog?!
"
,,
5,2,"From the station that reaches the beaches,
"
,,
5,2,"you're listening to Dingo and The Baby!
"
,,
5,2,"What the hell are you doing?
"
,,
5,2,"Wha-What the hell does that have
"
,,
5,2,"to do with anything?

5,2,"Hey there, champ.
"
,,
5,2,"Peter, I know this is all
"
,,
5,2,"a big adjustment for you,
"
,,
5,2,"but all I want is for
"
,,
5,2,"your mom to be happy.
"
,,
5,2,"Well, why can't she go back with my dad?
"
,,
5,2,"Well, I can't answer that, but I'm gonna do
"

5,2,"my best to make her
"

5,2,"even happier than those kids

"
,,
5,2,"What's your wish, Billy?
"
,,
5,2,"Can you cure my cancer?
"
,,
5,2,"No, but how about if Spider-Man gives you
"
,,
5,2,"a $50 gift card to Sears?!
"
,,
5,2,"He-Here, get well.
"
,,
5,2,"You know, I heard a
"
,,
5,2,"rumor about you today?
"
,,
5,2," You did?
"
,,
5,2," Yep.
"
,,
5,2,"I heard you like milk shakes.
"
,,
5,2,"Oh boy, do I!
"
,,
5,2,"Let's go get ourselves a shake, huh?
"
,,
5,2,"I want to get a milk shake, too.
"

5,2,"Too bad- go get your own father.
"

5,2,"Hey, Carl, can I get a carton
"
,,
5,2,"of smokes, please?
"

"
,,
5,2,"Oh, you like that, huh?
"
,,
5,2,"Yeah, does that thing squeak?
"
,,
5,2,"Yeah, it does.
"
,,
5,2,"All right, I'll take that,
"
,,
5,2,"and I'm gonna hurry home
"
,,
5,2,"and show it to Lois.
"
,,
5,2,"Hey, I'd recognize that voice anywhere!
"
,,
5,2,"You're Dingo, that dog that plays
"
,,
5,2,"all those fart sounds on the radio!
"
,,
5,2,"Awesome!
"
,,
5,2,"Oh, yeah, yeah, sorry about that,
"
,,
5,2,"the show's gotten a little lowbrow.
"
,,
5,2,"What are you talking about?!
"
,,
5,2,"It's, like, the most hilarious show ever!
"
,,
5,2,"Hey, could I get your autograph?
"
,,
5,2,"My... really?
"
,,
5,2,"Wow, you're... gosh,
"
,,
5,2,"you're making me feel
"
,,
5,2,"more important than
"
,,
5,2,"a dwarf among midgets.
"
,,
5,2,"Hey, can you reach the Crispix?
"
,,
5,2,"Yes, I can.
"
,,
5,2,"How awesome is this : going out

5,2,"to dinner with my new family?
"

5,2,"Hi, can I help you?
"
,,
5,2,"I want, I want that one!

5,2,"All right, hold on,
"
,,
5,2,"we'll get you that one.
"
,,
5,2,"I want straws!

5,2,"We'll get you a straw.
"

5,2,"No!
"
,,
5,2,"Do you mean, ""yes""?
"
,,
5,2,"Yes!
"
,,
5,2,"Okay, one Kid's Meal.
"
,,
5,2,"And what'll you have, honey?
"
,,
5,2,"I'll have a fish sandwich and a Sanka.
"
,,
5,2,"Oh, he's adorable.
"
,,
5,2,"Say hi to the nice lady, Peter.
"
,,
5,2,"Oh, he's shy.
"
,,
5,2,"and mashed potatoes</i>
"
,,
5,2,"We now return to the
"
,,
5,2,"Sunday afternoon movie:
"
,,
5,2,"Masturbator and Commander.
"
,,
5,2,"Captain, the enemy ship
"
,,
5,2,"has opened fire on us.
"
,,
5,2,"I'll be right out!
"
,,
5,2,"Sir, we've already lost ten men.
"
,,
5,2,"Hang on!
"
,,
5,2,"Sir, don't you think
"
,,
5,2,"we should return fire?
"
,,
5,2,"Yeah, yeah, go ahead and do that,
"
,,
5,2,"and I'll-I'll meet you up there
"
,,
5,2,"in like five minutes.
"
,,
5,2,"Peter, I've never seen you so happy.
"
,,
5,2,"Well, Lois, I never realized
"
,,
5,2,"what it was like
"
,,
5,2,"to have a real dad.
"
,,
5,2,"I mean, my own dad
"
,,
5,2,"was such a ballbuster,
"
,,
5,2,"I-I guess I just always
"
,,
5,2,"thought that was normal.
"
,,
5,2,"But Papa Tom is so different.
"
,,
5,2,"For the first time in my life,
"
,,
5,2,"I feel like I have a real family, you know?
"
,,
5,2,"I mean I'm-I'm not just going
"
,,
5,2,"through the motions
"
,,
5,2,"like I do around here.
"
,,
5,2,"Hey, champ, you want to
"
,,
5,2,"watch Chicken Little?
"
,,
5,2,"Yeah!
"
,,
5,2,"And what does a chicken say?
"
,,
5,2,"""Moo!""
"
,,
5,2,"Why not.
"
,,
5,2,"Come on, Ma!
"
,,
5,2,"Hey, what gives with the suitcase?
"
,,
5,2,"Tom, there's no easy way to say this,
"
,,
5,2,"I'll just come right out with it.
"
,,
5,2,"I'm leaving.
"
,,
5,2,"Wha...
"
,,
5,2,"leaving, why?
"
,,
5,2,"Tommy, this has been great,
"
,,
5,2,"but I wasn't looking
"
,,
5,2,"for anything long-term.
"
,,
5,2,"I just needed someone to clear
"
,,
5,2,"all the bats out of my plumbing.
"
,,
5,2,"What do we do now Bill?
"
,,
5,2,"We write, Tim.
"
,,
5,2,"We write our story.
"
,,
5,2,"Good bye, dear.
"
,,
5,2,"It's all my fault!
"
,,
5,2,"Nyah!
"
,,
5,2,"I know it hurts right now, Peter,
"
,,
5,2,"but we'll get through this.
"
,,
5,2,"You're still my little buddy, right?
"
,,
5,2,"Yeah.
"
,,
5,2,"Then we'll be okay. Good night, buddy.
"
,,
5,2,"Good night, Papa Tom.
"
,,
5,2,"Good night, son.
"
,,
5,2," Good night, Lois.
"
,,
5,2," Good night.
"
,,
5,2,"Peter, this is a little strange.
"
,,
5,2,"No stranger than when
"
,,
5,2,"Darth Vader was a meter maid.
"
,,
5,2,"Oh, come on, man, cut me a break!
"
,,
5,2,"I was only in there for like five minutes!
"
,,
5,2,"I already started writing the ticket.
"
,,
5,2,"You know, I make
"
,,
5,2,"your annual salary in a week.
"
,,
5,2,"Are you happy doing what you're doing?
"
,,
5,2,"'Cause you're pathetic.
"
,,
5,2,"I got to do it, Karen.
"
,,
5,2,"I just... I-I got to take a shot.
"
,,
5,2,"That guy, that guy just got to me today.
"
,,
5,2,"You do whatever you think is right,
"
,,
5,2,"and I'll support it.
"
,,
5,2,"I don't really understand it.
"
,,
5,2,"What do you want this loan for?
"
,,
5,2,"I want to build a giant space station
"
,,
5,2,"that can destroy a planet.
"
,,
5,2,"I don't know that that would be
"
,,
5,2,"a good investment on our end.
"
,,
5,2,"I mean, I want to open
"
,,
5,2,"a sports bar.
"
,,
5,2,"Good morning, Quahog!
"
,,
5,2,"You're here with Dingo...
"
,,
5,2,"And the Baby...
"
,,
5,2,"And if you're thinking
"
,,
5,2,"about changing the station...
"
,,
5,2,"Today, we got Homeless Hank from
"
,,
5,2,"the Dumpster out back with us.
"
,,
5,2,"Hey, I got an idea :
"
,,
5,2,"How about the first three women
"
,,
5,2,"willing to come down
"
,,
5,2,"and have sex with Hank

,,
5,2,"get free boob jobs

5,2,"Let's go to the phones.

5,2,"Go ahead caller, you're on

5,2,"Tell me something, Sindy, how'd you like
"
,,
5,2,"to come down here and get naked for us?
"
,,
5,2,"Sure.
"
,,
5,2,"I think we got a show.
"
,,
5,2,"Oh yeah, we got a show!
"
,,
5,2," We definitely got a show!

5,2,"supposed to be ""Food Fight!""
"
,,
5,2,"I want some ice cream.
"
,,
5,2,"No, Peter, you finish your food.
"
,,
5,2,"You, hey, you-you get back here,
"
,,
5,2,"right now, mister!
"

5,2,"Don't, don't you...
"

5,2,"get down from that chair,
"

5,2,"or you're in big trouble.
"
,,
5,2,"You put that ice cream back right now.
"
,,
5,2,"I mean it.
"
,,
5,2,"I am not kidding around.
"
,,
5,2,"I am not going to say it again.
"
,,
5,2,"Uh... if you put that ice cream
"

5,2,"in your mouth you're gonna be

5,2,"in big trouble, young man!

5,2,"I want my mommy!
"
,,
5,2,"Well I'm the best you've got!
"
,,
5,2,"All right, so you know the drill.
"
,,
5,2,"We're going to turn on the hot dog cannon,
"

5,2,"and for every hot dog that you
"

5,2,"catch in your mouth,
"

5,2,"you get a $100 toward a boob job

5,2,"that you desperately need.
"

5,2,"I know.
"
,,
5,2,"Okay, here we go.
"
,,
5,2,"Oh, a miss!
"
,,
5,2,"Aw, you got her in the eye with that one.
"
,,
5,2,"Whoa, that one was
"
,,
5,2,"a teat-seeking missile!
"
,,
5,2,"I'm looking for Brian Griffin.
"
,,
5,2,"Gore Vidal!
"
,,
5,2,"I was supposed to do The Lunch Hour?
"
,,
5,2,"Uh... this is The Lunch Hour.
"
,,
5,2,"That one felt like my dad.
"
,,
5,2,"I think I may have made a mistake.
"
,,
5,2,"No, no, no, no, this is it.
"
,,
5,2,"You're-you're in the right place.
"
,,
5,2,"Uh, listen, uh, why-why don't you
"
,,
5,2,"stick around and talk for a while.
"
,,
5,2,"My listeners would love
"
,,
5,2,"to hear about your new book.
"

5,2,"Hundred dollars, boob job!
"
,,
5,2,"I'm, uh, going to go.
"
,,
5,2,"Oh, my God, what have I done?
"
,,
5,2,"Hey, it's all about ratings,
"
,,
5,2,"baby, and we got 'em.
"
,,
5,2,"No, it wasn't worth it.
"
,,
5,2,"I'm sorry, Stewie, I can't do this anymore.
"
,,
5,2,"I'm more of a sell-out
"
,,
5,2,"than you were when you did
"
,,
5,2,"those Butterfinger commercials.
"
,,
5,2,"Nobody better lay a finger
"
,,
5,2,"on my Butterfinger.
"
,,
5,2,"D'oh!
"
,,
5,2,"What's your problem?
"
,,
5,2,"Ah, Papa Tom's being a jerk.
"
,,
5,2,"At least he talks to you.
"
,,
5,2,"He's my dad and he hasn't
"
,,
5,2,"paid attention to me in weeks.
"
,,
5,2,"Well, all-in-all, you should be thankful.
"
,,
5,2,"I think the Kennedys had a kid like you,
"
,,
5,2,"and they had it put to sleep.
"
,,
5,2,"Hey, Peter, I'm sorry about
"
,,
5,2,"that business with the ice cream.
"
,,
5,2,"I guess I'm just still a little
"
,,
5,2,"torn up about your mom.
"
,,
5,2,"But, hey, I'll make it up to you.
"
,,
5,2,"Let's play catch.
"
,,
5,2,"Okay!
"
,,
5,2,"Wait a minute, you know what?
"
,,
5,2,"I think you should play catch with Jake.
"
,,
5,2,"Really?
"
,,
5,2,"Yeah, I had a taste of what it was like
"
,,
5,2,"to have a real father.
"
,,
5,2,"I can't make him share his.
"
,,
5,2,"Well, all right, Peter, come on, Jake.
"
,,
5,2,"Huh, I guess I've learned
"
,,
5,2,"a little something
"
,,
5,2,"about what it means to be a good dad.
"
,,
5,2,"Hey, Dad, do you want to play baseball?
"
,,
5,2,"Oh, my God, could you leave me alone!
"
,,
5,2,"You are the neediest kid!
"
,,
5,2,"I can't believe you gave up our show.
"
,,
5,2,"Yeah, sorry.

5,3,"to pick up Meg at the roller rink.
"
,,
5,3," No! 
"
,,
5,3," We're just getting started!
"

5,3,"Oh, Meg is my least favorite of
"
,,
5,3,"all your children.
"
,,
5,3,"It's all right, we'll just move
"

5,3,"the party to the skating rink.
"
,,
5,3,"Who's sober enough to drive?
"
,,
5,3,"Ah, okay, who's drunk,
"
,,
5,3,"but that special kind of drunk
"
,,
5,3,"where you're a better driver
"
,,
5,3,"because you know you're drunk?
"
,,
5,3,"You know, the kind of drunk
"
,,
5,3,"where you probably shouldn't
"
,,
5,3,"drive, but you do anyway,
"
,,
5,3,"because, I mean, come on,
"
,,
5,3,"you got to get your car home.
"
,,
5,3,"Right? I mean, I mean, what do
"
,,
5,3,"they expect me to do, take a bus?
"
,,
5,3,"Is-is that what they want?
"
,,
5,3,"For me to take a bus?
"
,,
5,3,"Well, screw that.
"
,,
5,3,"You take a bus.
"
,,
5,3,"I'm that kind of drunk.
"

5,3,"Shotgun.
"
,,
5,3,"Dad, where have you been?
"
,,
5,3,"I've been waiting for over an hour.
"
,,
5,3,"Grab some wood there, bub.
"
,,
5,3,"Daddy and his friends have been drinking.
"
,,
5,3,"And we're gonna keep on drinking
"
,,
5,3,"until we each uncover
"
,,
5,3,"repressed memories of sexual abuse

,,
5,3,"by a trusted religious official.
"
,,
5,3,"Oh, that's crazy tal...
"

5,3,"Minister Washington, how could you?!
"
,,
5,3,"Man, look at all these chicks!
"
,,
5,3,"Oh, wow.
"
,,
5,3,"Wow. If I were a woman,
"
,,
5,3,"I would press my bare boobs
"
,,
5,3,"up against glass in public
"
,,
5,3,"just for the sexual thrill!
"
,,
5,3,"The sexual thrill!
"
,,
5,3,"How do I stop?!
"
,,
5,3,"Use the rubber stoppers on the front.
"
,,
5,3,"Hey, baby, how'd you like
"
,,
5,3,"to share a pair of skates?
"

5,3,"Oh, hey, baby,
"
,,
5,3,"you want to go somewhere?

5,3,"No, no, no, no, no.
"

5,3,"Wait, wait, Quagmire, remember
"
,,
5,3,"what's on the other side.
"
,,
5,3,"That was awesome!
"
,,
5,3,"Oh, my God, that was
"
,,
5,3,"completely by accident.
"
,,
5,3,"That was great fun.
"
,,
5,3,"I don't even remember why we came,

,,
5,3,"Oop, didn't answer
"
,,
5,3,"me quick enough.
"
,,
5,3,"Remember those sweet,
"
,,
5,3,"warm New England summers?
"
,,
5,3,"Remember sipping lemonade
"
,,
5,3,"underneath a shady tree?
"
,,
5,3,"Remember when you hit
"
,,
5,3,"that pedestrian with your car
"
,,
5,3,"at the crosswalk 
"
,,
5,3,"and then just drove away?
"
,,
5,3,"Pepperidge Farm remembers.
"
,,
5,3,"But Pepperidge Farm ain't
"
,,
5,3,"just gonna keep it
"
,,
5,3,"to Pepperidge Farm's
"
,,
5,3,"self free of charge.
"
,,
5,3,"Maybe you go outand buy yourself
"
,,
5,3,"some of these distinctive
"
,,
5,3,"Milano cookies,
"
,,
5,3,"maybe this whole thing
"
,,
5,3,"just disappears.
"
,,
5,3,"Meg, what happened?
"
,,
5,3,"Fat Ass and his drunk friends
"
,,
5,3,"left me at the roller rink.
"
,,
5,3,"You know, this wouldn't have
"
,,
5,3,"happened if I had my own car.
"
,,
5,3,"Meg, people have always found ways
"
,,
5,3,"to get around without a car.
"
,,
5,3,"Look at Iceman.
"
,,
5,3,"Honey, where'd you go
"
,,
5,3,"when you went out last night?
"
,,
5,3,"Uh, just over to Tom's house.
"
,,
5,3,"Played some poker,
"
,,
5,3,"had some brewskis, you know.
"
,,
5,3,"Really?
"
,,
5,3,"Then would you mind explaining that?
"
,,
5,3,"At least they know
"
,,
5,3,"how to touch a man.
"
,,
5,3,"Oh, walk away.
"
,,
5,3,"You know, Peter, maybe Meg
"
,,
5,3,"having her own car
"
,,
5,3," isn't such a bad idea.
"
,,
5,3," Yeah, I guess so.
"
,,
5,3,"What?! I have been trying to get
"
,,
5,3,"a sewing machine for months,
"
,,
5,3,"but she gets a freakin' car
"
,,
5,3,"just like that?!
"
,,
5,3,"I hate this place.
"
,,
5,3,"Look at all these Hummers.
"
,,
5,3,"What kind of jerk
"
,,
5,3,"would drive one of those?
"
,,
5,3,"Dude, this car kicks ass!
"
,,
5,3,"And I can watch Madagascar
"
,,
5,3,"while I'm driving!
"
,,
5,3,"What kind of music
"
,,
5,3,"do you like, Gloria?
"
,,
5,3,"Hippo-hop.
"
,,
5,3,"Dude, those animals are so fucking funny,
"
,,
5,3,"they make me want to merge
"
,,
5,3,"without looking!
"
,,
5,3,"Yeah! Rumsfeld!
"
,,
5,3,"Hi, there, can I help you folks?
"
,,
5,3,"Yeah, uh, my daughter's looking for a car
"
,,
5,3,"that goes with her personality.
"
,,
5,3,"Yes, are the new bulimic
"
,,
5,3,"cutting mobiles in yet?
"
,,
5,3,"This is a 1996 sedan.
"
,,
5,3,"Excellent gas mileage,
"
,,
5,3,"air bags and AM/FM cassette.
"
,,
5,3,"I love it!
"
,,
5,3,"Dad, this is the car.
"
,,
5,3,"Eh, hang on a second, Meg.
"
,,
5,3,"What can you tell me about this one?
"
,,
5,3,"Oh, that's just an old tank I use
"
,,
5,3,"for those commercials where
"
,,
5,3,"I declare war on high prices.
"
,,
5,3,"Now, about that sedan...
"
,,
5,3,"Hang on there, slick.
"
,,
5,3,"Now I see your game.
"
,,
5,3,"We come in here
"
,,
5,3,"wanting a practical car,
"
,,
5,3,"but then you dangle this tank
"
,,
5,3,"in front of me
"
,,
5,3,"and expect me to walk away.
"
,,
5,3,"Now, I may be an idiot,
"
,,
5,3,"but there is one thing I am not, sir,
"
,,
5,3,"and that, sir, is an idiot.
"
,,
5,3,"Now, I demand you tell me
"
,,
5,3,"more about this tank.
"
,,
5,3,"Well, if you're looking for
"
,,
5,3,"quality, then look no further.
"
,,
5,3,"That's more like it.
"
,,
5,3,"Tell me, what are the tank's
"
,,
5,3,"safety features?
"
,,
5,3,"What a good-looking question.
"
,,
5,3,"Three inches of reinforced steel
"
,,
5,3,"protects your daughter from
"
,,
5,3,"short-range missile attacks.
"
,,
5,3,"I see. And does the sedan
"
,,
5,3,"protect against missiles?
"
,,
5,3,"It does not.
"
,,
5,3,"Ah, you hear that, Meg?
"
,,
5,3,"Yeah, it does not protect
"
,,
5,3,"against missiles.
"
,,
5,3,"See, these... these are the questions.
"
,,
5,3,"This is why I'm here.
"
,,
5,3,"Peter, you can't be serious.
"
,,
5,3,"This is a 30-ton war machine.
"
,,
5,3,"I'm still not sure.
"
,,
5,3,"Did I mention the tank is a tank?
"
,,
5,3,"Sold.
"
,,
5,3,"Okay, Lois, you can open your eyes.
"
,,
5,3,"Boccie balls!
"
,,
5,3,"I bought a tank!
"
,,
5,3,"Are you out of your mind?!
"
,,
5,3,"Let me show you how the gun works.
"
,,
5,3,"What the hell?!
"
,,
5,3,"No, no, no, no, no, no...!
"
,,
5,3,"Hey, Peter, can you blow
"
,,
5,3,"that towel rack down here?
"
,,
5,3,"Thank you.
"
,,
5,3,"I ordered a pizza, I hope that's okay.
"
,,
5,3,"Sure, I love pizza.
"
,,
5,3,"This half of the apartment is mine.
"
,,
5,3,"But if you want to come over here,
"
,,
5,3,"that's okay, too.
"
,,
5,3,"This isn't spaghetti, it's linguini.
"
,,
5,3,"You're right, it is!
"
,,
5,3,"I always get those confused.
"
,,
5,3,"Hey, all of us are human.
"
,,
5,3,"I'm glad we're friends.
"
,,
5,3,"Yeah, this is really working out.
"
,,
5,3,"There's no conflict in this movie!
"
,,
5,3,"When are you gonna get rid of that stump?!
"
,,
5,3,"I've been asking you for months
"
,,
5,3,"to get rid of that stump!
"
,,
5,3,"I'll do it, all right?!
"
,,
5,3,"Just get off my back!
"
,,
5,3,"She's gone.
"
,,
5,3,"We can finally be together.
"
,,
5,3,"But, Tim, I'm rooted to the ground.
"
,,
5,3,"We'll find a way.
"
,,
5,3,"We'll find a way.
"
,,
5,3,"My God, it's hot.
"
,,
5,3,"Brian, did you turn off
"
,,
5,3,"the air conditioner?
"
,,
5,3,"Just open a window.
"
,,
5,3,"Air conditioners are harmful
"
,,
5,3,"to the ozone layer.
"
,,
5,3,"Brian, please.
"
,,
5,3,"Save your hippie B.S.
"
,,
5,3,"for the winter months, okay?
"
,,
5,3,"Hey, Brian. I'm not gonna recycle
"
,,
5,3,"this aluminum can.
"
,,
5,3,"I'm just gonna throw it in the trash.
"
,,
5,3,"Ha! you are earth's bitch!
"
,,
5,3,"Morning, civilians.
"
,,
5,3,"General Griffin reporting for breakfast.
"
,,
5,3,"Dad, it's not fair.
"
,,
5,3,"My money paid for that tank,
"
,,
5,3,"and I haven't even gotten to drive it yet.
"
,,
5,3,"Jeez, Meg, you always got to ruin
"
,,
5,3,"my good time.
"
,,
5,3,"Just like basic cable.
"
,,
5,3," Yeah!
"
,,
5,3,"Aw.
"
,,
5,3,"All right, Meg, you got a feel
"
,,
5,3,"for the controls.
"
,,
5,3,"Now give it a little gas.
"
,,
5,3,"Oh, great, it's here.
"
,,
5,3,"That mirror I bought on eBay.
"
,,
5,3,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
5,3,"Joe, my God, what happened?
"
,,
5,3,"You just ran over me, you bastard.
"
,,
5,3,"I don't know where you got that
"
,,
5,3,"thing, but I'm impounding it!
"
,,
5,3,"Look at you.
"
,,
5,3,"You look like a half-empty toothpaste.
"
,,
5,3,"I don't understand.
"
,,
5,3,"Why do all you ghosts come to me?
"
,,
5,3,"You're-you're really...
"
,,
5,3,"Um, you have a knack f...
"
,,
5,3,"We-we just trust you.
"
,,
5,3,"I can't believe you let Mr. Swanson
"
,,
5,3,"confiscate
"
,,
5,3,"the closest thing I had to a car.
"
,,
5,3,"Relax, Meg, it's not the worst thing
"
,,
5,3,"I've ever done.
"
,,
5,3,"You remember that favor
"
,,
5,3,"I did for that park ranger?
"
,,
5,3,"Hey, Boo Boo, let's see what
"
,,
5,3,"we got in this pic-a-nic basket.
"
,,
5,3,"Tell the other bears what you just saw.
"
,,
5,3,"Well, I don't care.
"
,,
5,3,"'Cause you know what I'm gonna do?
"
,,
5,3,"I'm gonna get a job and buy a real car.
"
,,
5,3,"Hey, Meg, I'll pay you a dollar a day
"
,,
5,3,"to smell my sneakers.
"
,,
5,3,"Oh! I peed and pooped.
"
,,
5,3,"You know, I read that they're opening
"
,,
5,3,"a Superstore USA across town.
"
,,
5,3,"Maybe you could get a job there.
"
,,
5,3,"No, no, no way.
"
,,
5,3,"You cannot work there, Meg.
"
,,
5,3,"Giant mega-stores like Superstore USA
"
,,
5,3,"are ruining this country.
"
,,
5,3,"They don't pay their employees
"
,,
5,3,"a decent wage
"
,,
5,3,"or give them health benefits.
"
,,
5,3,"Oh, yeah, all gay guys hate
"
,,
5,3,"Superstore USA.
"
,,
5,3," What?
"
,,
5,3," Hmm?
"
,,
5,3,"Hey, I'm just trying to be ethical.
"
,,
5,3,"Yeah, right. You hate all megastores,
"
,,
5,3,"ever since you were petted way too hard
"
,,
5,3,"by that special boy in front of Kmart.
"
,,
5,3,"Doggie!
"
,,
5,3,"Doggie!
"
,,
5,3," Doggie!
"
,,
5,3," Too hard.
"
,,
5,3," I like doggie!
"
,,
5,3," Too hard.
"
,,
5,3," Doggie!
"
,,
5,3," Gonna bite.
"
,,
5,3," Doggie!
"
,,
5,3," Gonna bite.
"
,,
5,3,"Doggie!
"
,,
5,3,"Oh, Jeez.
"
,,
5,3,"Welcome to the
"
,,
5,3,"Superstore family, Meg.
"
,,
5,3," Glad to have you.
"
,,
5,3," Thanks.
"
,,
5,3,"I'm really excited to get to work.
"
,,
5,3,"Now, let me just go over a few basics.
"
,,
5,3,"You'll earn minimum wage, no overtime,
"
,,
5,3,"no health benefits, and every day at 3:00,
"
,,
5,3,"you'll need to give Sloth a Baby Ruth.
"
,,
5,3,"Oh, it's nearly 3:00, now.
"
,,
5,3,"Here you go.
"
,,
5,3,"You're beautiful.
"
,,
5,3,"I would go out with you
"
,,
5,3,"if I wasn't already in a
"
,,
5,3,"committed relationship.
"
,,
5,3,"Hey, guys, what's going on?
"
,,
5,3,"Oh, Peter, Superstore USA has taken
"
,,
5,3,"all my business.
"
,,
5,3,"Mine, too.
"
,,
5,3,"In fact, the only guy in town
"
,,
5,3,"making any money
"
,,
5,3,"is that guy who makes tumbleweeds.
"
,,
5,3,"Y'all laughed at me.
"
,,
5,3,"Y'all laughed at me.
"
,,
5,3,"Well, who's laughing now?
"
,,
5,3,"What do you think of this?
"
,,
5,3,"That makes you attractive.
"
,,
5,3,"Yeah!
"
,,
5,3,"Well, maybe now, you guys are seeing
"
,,
5,3,"what I've been trying to explain to you.
"
,,
5,3,"That mega store is a big,
"
,,
5,3,"evil corporation
"
,,
5,3,"that means nothing but trouble
"
,,
5,3,"for this town.
"
,,
5,3,"Aw, man, this is the worst thing
"
,,
5,3,"to happen to this town since
"
,,
5,3,"that roving gang of Tom Brokaws.
"
,,
5,3,"Looks like someone's a little lost.
"
,,
5,3,"Everyone, I have some bad news.
"
,,
5,3,"Superstore USA has their
"
,,
5,3,"own brewery on-site
"
,,
5,3,"and can sell beer at a much
"
,,
5,3,"cheaper price.
"
,,
5,3,"So management has decided
"
,,
5,3,"to close down.
"
,,
5,3," You mean, I'm out of a job again?
"
,,
5,3," I'm sorry, Peter.
"
,,
5,3,"Man, this sucks worse than
"
,,
5,3,"Easter Sunday at Richard Gere's house.
"
,,
5,3,"Okay, find the Easter egg.
"
,,
5,3,"I know where it is. It's in your butt.
"
,,
5,3,"No.
"
,,
5,3,"Yeah, I know the story, it's in your butt.
"
,,
5,3,"Mr. Griffin, if you'd just look
"
,,
5,3,"on the ground for five seconds
"
,,
5,3," I'm sure you'd find it.
"
,,
5,3," Nope, in your butt.
"
,,
5,3," Look, I'm tired of this stupid rumor.
"
,,
5,3," In your butt.
"
,,
5,3," Mr. Griffin.
"
,,
5,3," Butt.
"
,,
5,3," Mr. Griffin.
"
,,
5,3," Butt.
"
,,
5,3,"You know what, just get
"
,,
5,3,"the hell out of here.
"
,,
5,3,"Fine. Weirdo.
"
,,
5,3,"So, how was work
"
,,
5,3,"today, Meg?
"
,,
5,3,"Oh, Peter, you lost your job
"
,,
5,3,"because of the Superstore,
"
,,
5,3,"you shouldn't blame Meg.
"
,,
5,3,"And you can stop making that fart sound
"
,,
5,3,"every time someone says ""Meg.""
"
,,
5,3,"So, how was your day exploiting
"
,,
5,3,"the town's resources, Meg?
"
,,
5,3,"Meg.
"
,,
5,3,"Meg.
"
,,
5,3,"Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg,
"
,,
5,3,"Meg, Meg, Meg.
"
,,
5,3,"Meg.
"
,,
5,3,"I'm not going to sit here and take this.
"
,,
5,3,"I'm the only one in this family
"
,,
5,3,"who has a job.
"
,,
5,3,"Yeah, like she'd get paid for that.
"
,,
5,3,"What did he just say to you?
"
,,
5,3,"Nothing,th-there was...
"
,,
5,3,"Well, it-it's like if you were...
"
,,
5,3,"F-Forget it, it's nothing, Meg.
"
,,
5,3," Hello. I'm Tom Tucker.
"
,,
5,3," And I'm Diane Simmons.
"
,,
5,3,"At the top of the news, Quahog is suffering
"
,,
5,3,"it's worst heat wave in a century.
"
,,
5,3,"That's right, Diane.
"
,,
5,3,"We now go live to Ollie Williams
"
,,
5,3,"with the Blaccu-weather report.
"
,,
5,3,"How are you beating the heat, Ollie?
"
,,
5,3," Swimmin' hole.
"
,,
5,3," Thanks, Ollie.
"
,,
5,3,"In other news, Quahog will be
"
,,
5,3,"experiencing rolling blackouts
"
,,
5,3,"to help meet Superstore USA's
"
,,
5,3,"extensive power demands.
"
,,
5,3,"Oh, in fact, Channel Five
"
,,
5,3,"has just received
"
,,
5,3,"this message from the Electric Company.
"
,,
5,3,"Hey, you guys!
"
,,
5,3,"can be, Through the courtesy</i>
"
,,
5,3,"The Electric Company.</i>
"
,,
5,3,"Contrary to those
"
,,
5,3,"upbeat lyrics,
"
,,
5,3,"the Electric Company
"
,,
5,3,"would like us to emphasize
"
,,
5,3,"it will not be bringing you the power.
"
,,
5,3,"Great, rolling blackouts.
"
,,
5,3,"Now, Superstore USA is siphoning off
"
,,
5,3,"all the city's power.
"
,,
5,3,"And they cost me my job.
"
,,
5,3,"Mine, too.
"
,,
5,3,"Superstore USA has their own paper route.
"
,,
5,3,"That new paper boy done gone
"
,,
5,3,"and broke my sternum.
"
,,
5,3,"Ah, this sucks.
"
,,
5,3,"That damn Superstore's ruining everything.
"
,,
5,3,"You know, instead of sitting
"
,,
5,3,"around complaining,
"
,,
5,3,"why don't we go down there and protest?
"
,,
5,3,"That's a great idea, Brian.
"
,,
5,3,"All we need is some magic markers,
"
,,
5,3,"posterboard, some plywood...
"
,,
5,3,"Actually, Superstore USA has
"
,,
5,3,"all that stuff. We can just get it there.
"
,,
5,3,"There's one of them now.
"
,,
5,3,"Take that for stealing jobs
"
,,
5,3,"from hardworking people.
"
,,
5,3,"Dad, what the hell are you doing?
"
,,
5,3,"We got a message for you.
"
,,
5,3,"We're here, we're queer, get used to it.
"
,,
5,3," Uh, actually, Peter...
"
,,
5,3," Gattaca, Gattaca!
"
,,
5,3,"Peter, I don't think it's working.
"
,,
5,3,"People are still going into the store.
"
,,
5,3,"Well, fine, then I guess I got to go
"
,,
5,3,"in there and drag 'em out one by one.
"
,,
5,3,"All right, who the hell is in charge...
"
,,
5,3,"Ah... ah, wha-what is that I'm feeling?
"
,,
5,3,"That's our industrialsized
"
,,
5,3,"air conditioner.
"
,,
5,3,"Wow.
"
,,
5,3,"When I walk into Superstore USA,
"
,,
5,3,"I get the sensation...
"
,,
5,3,"that I'm standing on a mountain top
"
,,
5,3,"with the wind blowing through my hair.
"
,,
5,3,"My God, look at this wonderland
"
,,
5,3,"of treasures.
"
,,
5,3,"What would a guy like me have to do
"
,,
5,3,"to be part of this magical world?
"
,,
5,3,"You are trespassing on private property
"
,,
5,3,"and I must ask you to leave.
"
,,
5,3,"What? Are you out of your mind?
"
,,
5,3,"Leave this lot, losers.
"
,,
5,3,"Unless you want a licking.
"
,,
5,3,"And we'd love to deliver that licking,
"
,,
5,3,"right, fellas?
"
,,
5,3," Yeah. Love it.
"
,,
5,3," A lot.
"
,,
5,3,"I'd love to lick a lemon lollipop
"
,,
5,3,"in Lillehammer.
"
,,
5,3,"God, I wish the power would come back on.
"
,,
5,3,"Boy, Meg, I am so looking forward
"
,,
5,3,"to this job.
"
,,
5,3,"Peter, I can't believe you're
"
,,
5,3,"working for Superstore USA.
"
,,
5,3,"How could you sell out like that?
"
,,
5,3,"Because, Brian, they have an
"
,,
5,3,"industrialsized air conditioner.
"
,,
5,3,"And I'm tired of sitting in balls soup.
"
,,
5,3,"Look, Dad, this isn't going
"
,,
5,3,"to be a cakewalk, all right?
"
,,
5,3,"I'm your supervisor.
"
,,
5,3,"Meg, Meg, I promise I'll do better
"
,,
5,3,"at this job than I did on the SAT's.
"
,,
5,3,"Come on.
"
,,
5,3,"Do math.
"
,,
5,3,"Dad, I need you to...
"
,,
5,3,"Dad, what are you doing?
"
,,
5,3,"Meg, Meg, look, Meg look.
"
,,
5,3,"I am so freaking good at coloring.
"
,,
5,3,"I know I'm not supposed to go
"
,,
5,3,"outside the lines,
"
,,
5,3,"but I do anyway because I like
"
,,
5,3,"being myself.
"
,,
5,3,"Dad?
"
,,
5,3,"Dad?
"
,,
5,3,"Dad?
"
,,
5,3,"Oh, God, it's so hot.
"
,,
5,3,"Uh, Brian, spit on me.
"
,,
5,3,"Oh, that's nice.
"
,,
5,3,"Now, tell me I'm scum.
"
,,
5,3," How will that cool you off? 
"
,,
5,3," Hmm?
"
,,
5,3,"God, it's awful in here.
"
,,
5,3,"This is even worse than getting
"
,,
5,3,"herpes from a toilet seat.
"
,,
5,3,"Joanie, it's me.
"
,,
5,3,"Oh, hey.
"
,,
5,3,"You know, I had such a great
"
,,
5,3,"time with you last night.
"
,,
5,3,"Listen, there's something
"
,,
5,3,"I have to tell you.
"
,,
5,3,"I just got back from the doctor.
"
,,
5,3,"I have herpes.
"
,,
5,3,"I think you should get yourself
"
,,
5,3,"checked out.
"
,,
5,3," Oh, my God.
"
,,
5,3," Will you stay?
"
,,
5,3,"What?
"
,,
5,3,"Will you stay with me,
"
,,
5,3,"even knowing that I have herpes?
"
,,
5,3,"Yes, I will.
"
,,
5,3," Joanie?
"
,,
5,3," Yeah?
"
,,
5,3,"I don't have herpes.
"
,,
5,3,"I just needed to know that you'd stay.
"
,,
5,3,"I've had it, the only place in town
"
,,
5,3,"that's got power is Superstore USA,
"
,,
5,3,"while the rest of us are left
"
,,
5,3,"to bake in the heat.
"
,,
5,3,"There's got to be something we
"
,,
5,3,"can do to take that place down.
"
,,
5,3,"Don't worry, Brian,
"
,,
5,3,"I think I've got an idea.
"
,,
5,3,"Oh, yeah.
"
,,
5,3,"Excuse me, can you tell me where
"
,,
5,3,"I can find a assault rifles?
"
,,
5,3,"Aisle 6.
"
,,
5,3,"How about a list of known
"
,,
5,3,"local homosexuals?
"
,,
5,3,"Aisle 4.
"
,,
5,3,"Meg, you're doing a great job.
"
,,
5,3,"In fact, I'm promoting you
"
,,
5,3,"to assistant manager.
"
,,
5,3,"Really? Oh, my God.
"
,,
5,3,"Thank you so much.
"
,,
5,3,"Now, your first responsibility
"
,,
5,3,"is to fire that employee.
"
,,
5,3,"Boy, I'm a little chilly.
"
,,
5,3,"I hope no one notices.
"
,,
5,3,"But that's my dad.
"
,,
5,3,"What's more important to you,
"
,,
5,3,"your job or your family?
"
,,
5,3,"And don't pick the obvious one.
"
,,
5,3,"Oh, hey, guys, I was just catching up
"
,,
5,3,"on some plunger nipples.
"
,,
5,3,"Dad, um...
"
,,
5,3,"Go on, Meg.
"
,,
5,3,"What are you waiting for?
"
,,
5,3,"Dad, I'm sorry I have to say this,
"
,,
5,3,"but you're a fat ass who's
"
,,
5,3,"completely incapable
"
,,
5,3,"of performing the simplest tasks.
"
,,
5,3,"But... you're also my father.
"
,,
5,3,"And you're the only one I'll ever have.
"
,,
5,3,"So, I'm not going to fire you.
"
,,
5,3,"Mr. Penisberg, I quit.
"
,,
5,3,"Penisberg?
"
,,
5,3,"Yeah, yeah, get it all out of your system.
"
,,
5,3,"Meg, that was a wonderful
"
,,
5,3,"thing you just did for me.
"
,,
5,3,"I can't believe this is
"
,,
5,3,"coming out of my mouth, but...
"
,,
5,3,"I love y...
"
,,
5,3,"So, you got a tank.
"
,,
5,3,"Big whoop.
"
,,
5,3,"Want to fight about i...
"
,,
5,3,"Huh, well, I'm glad
"
,,
5,3,"that Superstore USA is gone.
"
,,
5,3,"That place was nothing but trouble.
"
,,
5,3,"And I think we learned something.
"
,,
5,3,"Any problem caused by a tank
"
,,
5,3,"can be solved by a tank.
"
,,
5,3,"Dad, you were about to say
"
,,
5,3,"something in the store.
"
,,
5,3,"No, I don't think so.
"
,,
5,3,"No, I'm sure of it.
"
,,
5,3,"Oh, I don't know, something
"
,,
5,3,"about Hardcastle and McCormick?
"
,,
5,3,"No, you were going to say you loved me.
"
,,
5,3,"You love me and you know it.
"
,,
5,3,"Hey, hey, mouth, young lady.
"
,,
5,3,"Well, you think you'll look
"
,,
5,3,"for another job, Meg?
"
,,
5,3,"Meg!
"
,,
5,3,"Meg.
"
,,
5,3,"Meg.
"
,,
5,3,"Uh-oh.
"
,,
5,3,"Pardon me.

"
,,
5,4,"All right, kids, assembly is starting.
"
,,
5,4,"Now please take your seats for the
"
,,
5,4,"following presentation by the U.S. Army.
"
,,
5,4," What's up, y'all? I'm Sergeant Extreme!
"
,,
5,4," And I'm Major Awesome!
"
,,
5,4,"We're here to tell you how much
"
,,
5,4,"the army kicks ass! Check this out!
"
,,
5,4,"The army sounds awesome!
"
,,
5,4,"And the recruiter said with any luck,
"
,,
5,4,"I could get the clap from
"
,,
5,4,"a 12-year-old Chinese prostitute.
"
,,
5,4,"Wow, that's great.
"
,,
5,4,"You'll be serving your country, just like
"
,,
5,4,"American film legend Mickey Rooney.
"
,,
5,4,"Hi. I'm former biggest star
"
,,
5,4,"in the world, Mickey Rooney.
"
,,
5,4,"And as you may know, I am
"
,,
5,4,"totally and completely insane.
"
,,
5,4,"I like to yell at mice with my shirt off.
"
,,
5,4,"Sometimes I like
"
,,
5,4,"to steal other people's scabs.
"
,,
5,4,"How do I stay so crazy?
"
,,
5,4,"Mickey Rooney's Crazy Pills!
"
,,
5,4,"Take one with breakfast, one with lunch,
"
,,
5,4,"and before you know it, you'll be up
"
,,
5,4,"on your roof; pooping in the chimney.
"
,,
5,4,"Hold out your stockings, kids!
"
,,
5,4,"Chris, you can't join the army,
"
,,
5,4,"you're too young.
"
,,
5,4,"Besides, the army is weak.
"
,,
5,4,"Now, the marines,
"
,,
5,4,"those are the men you want to (beep).
"
,,
5,4,"Are you kidding, Lois? The army's great!
"
,,
5,4,"You get to save money for college,
"
,,
5,4,"there's free food,
"
,,
5,4,"and all the brown people you can rape.
"
,,
5,4,"I am sorry, but he is not joining the army.
"
,,
5,4,"Case closed.
"
,,
5,4,"I can't believe they're brainwashing
"
,,
5,4,"kids like Chris to serve in the military.
"
,,
5,4,"Ah, yes, the bottom ten percent
"
,,
5,4,"of our high school class
"
,,
5,4,"is off to fight another battle.
"
,,
5,4," You stole that from The Onion.
"
,,
5,4," What?
"
,,
5,4,"I read that in The Onion.
"
,,
5,4,"About the war in Iraq.
"
,,
5,4,"Well, if that's true, then I'd say they've
"
,,
5,4,"got some sharp cookies over at the, uh...
"
,,
5,4,"Wh-What is it again? The Onion?
"
,,
5,4,"So if I go up to your room right now,
"
,,
5,4,"I'm not gonna find
"
,,
5,4,"a copy of The Onion, right?
"
,,
5,4,"No.
"
,,
5,4," Ow! Damn it!
"
,,
5,4," That's what I thought.
"
,,
5,4,"Everybody Loves Raymond,</i>
"
,,
5,4,"Robert, even more, in Robert.</i>
"
,,
5,4,"I bet you Debra really gave it
"
,,
5,4,"to Ray today.
"
,,
5,4,"I bet you she made a sandwich that
"
,,
5,4,"wasn't very good, but he ate it anyway.
"
,,
5,4,"And then she got mad at him
"
,,
5,4,"'cause he gave her a funny look.
"
,,
5,4,"I miss Ray.
"
,,
5,4,"I can't believe Chris would just buy into
"
,,
5,4,"that army recruiter's sales pitch.
"
,,
5,4,"We can't let him enlist.
"
,,
5,4,"Don't worry, Lois,
"
,,
5,4,"all he needs is an after-school
"
,,
5,4,"activity to get his mind off the army.
"
,,
5,4,"Just something to distract him.
"
,,
5,4,"You know, like all of America gets
"
,,
5,4,"distracted whenever a cute white girl dies.
"
,,
5,4,"We regret to report that not all the
"
,,
5,4,"children onboard the school bus survived.
"
,,
5,4,"We have identified the body of one victim,
"
,,
5,4,"nine-year-old Becky Gunderson.
"
,,
5,4,"No, wait, that's, uh, Becky Gutierrez.
"
,,
5,4,"That's not news.
"
,,
5,4,"B-Brian, wha... what are you doing?
"
,,
5,4,"Gymboree is that way.
"
,,
5,4,"Brian, it's parachute day!
"
,,
5,4,"I just want to swing by
"
,,
5,4,"the army recruiting center
"
,,
5,4,"and give a piece of my mind to that
"
,,
5,4,"jerk who tried to brainwash Chris.
"
,,
5,4,"We are gonna be so late.
"
,,
5,4,"I'm not gonna have a partner.
"
,,
5,4,"I'm gonna have to be partners
"
,,
5,4,"with the teacher.
"
,,
5,4,"It's just wrong for the military
"
,,
5,4,"to mess with kids' minds.
"
,,
5,4,"They're all gonna wind up in therapy,
"
,,
5,4,"like Peter was.
"
,,
5,4,"Every time my daughter opens her mouth,
"
,,
5,4,"I just want to punch her in the face.
"
,,
5,4,"She's really annoying.
"
,,
5,4,"Uh-huh. All right, let's explore that.
"
,,
5,4,"What the hell's wrong with you?
"
,,
5,4,"Your skin's, like,
"
,,
5,4,"moving around or something.
"
,,
5,4,"I believe
"
,,
5,4,"I'm having some sort of seizure.
"
,,
5,4,"What kind of after-school activity
"
,,
5,4,"should I do, Dad?
"
,,
5,4,"Well, Chris, there's a lot
"
,,
5,4,"of fun activities out there.
"
,,
5,4,"For example,
"
,,
5,4,"I used to be a horse whisperer.
"
,,
5,4,"Pfft, maybe if she spent some time
"
,,
5,4,"on the treadmill and I was drunk.
"
,,
5,4,"I wouldn't, either.
"
,,
5,4,"I don't think any of this stuff
"
,,
5,4,"is right for me, Dad.
"
,,
5,4,"Let's just face it... I suck!
"
,,
5,4,"Sounds like you guys
"
,,
5,4,"could use some fresh blood.
"
,,
5,4,"This is my son, Chris.
"
,,
5,4,"You should hear his voice.
"
,,
5,4,"It's absolutely gorgeous.
"
,,
5,4,"Like Laura Dern if
"
,,
5,4,"she didn't look like a banana.
"
,,
5,4,"He can sing?
"
,,
5,4,"Yeah, runs in the family.
"
,,
5,4,"See, look.
"
,,
5,4,"and dressing like a dude.</i>
"
,,
5,4,"Yeah, rock and roll!
"
,,
5,4,"Did you hear that?
"
,,
5,4,"Guys, I think we just found
"
,,
5,4,"our new lead singer.
"
,,
5,4,"Awesome!
"
,,
5,4,"I'm gonna be a famous music star,
"
,,
5,4,"like Muddy Waters!
"
,,
5,4,"Muddy? Baby?
"
,,
5,4,"Everything all right in there?
"
,,
5,4,"a kidney stone.</i>
"
,,
5,4,"Boy, I can't wait to lay into
"
,,
5,4,"that recruiter.
"
,,
5,4,"Yes, you'll be about as effective
"
,,
5,4,"as the Wizard of Oz
"
,,
5,4,"was at granting wishes.
"
,,
5,4,"And, Dorothy, you wanted herpes,
"
,,
5,4,"but little did you know,
"
,,
5,4,"you've had herpes all along.
"
,,
5,4,"I didn't want herpes!
"
,,
5,4,"Well...
"
,,
5,4,"you've got it.
"
,,
5,4,"Yes, uh, I'd like to see
"
,,
5,4,"the army recruiter.
"
,,
5,4,"Oh, you'll have to have a seat.
"
,,
5,4,"There's a 25-minute wait.
"
,,
5,4,"Oh, God. All right, I better go put more
"
,,
5,4,"money in the meter.
"
,,
5,4,"Peggy, would you send in the next...
"
,,
5,4,"Oh, you're already here.
"
,,
5,4,"Say, aren't you a little young
"
,,
5,4,"to join the army?
"
,,
5,4,"No, I have that, uh... Webster disease.
"
,,
5,4,"Hey, is that the M9 double-action pistol?
"
,,
5,4,"Sure is. Standard issue in the army.
"
,,
5,4," Where do I sign?
"
,,
5,4," Right here.
"
,,
5,4,"Did I mention there's a hundred-dollar
"
,,
5,4,"bonus if you sign up a buddy?
"
,,
5,4,"Really? Well, I think I have a surprise
"
,,
5,4,"for somebody.
"
,,
5,4,"There you are.
"
,,
5,4,"Congratulations,
"
,,
5,4,"you are both in the army.
"
,,
5,4,"We're bothin... What?
"
,,
5,4,"That's ridiculous.
"
,,
5,4,"I'll tell you what's ridiculous :
"
,,
5,4,"the Kaiser.
"
,,
5,4,"Somebody should put him on a roll.
"
,,
5,4,"till it's over over there.</i>
"
,,
5,4,"Commercial!
"
,,
5,4,"Damn!
"
,,
5,4,"Play me some filler, Johnny.
"
,,
5,4,"Okay, they're dead, all right?
"
,,
5,4,"We're not gonna be seeing them again.
"
,,
5,4,"My God!
"
,,
5,4,"You are the sorriest bunch of rejects
"
,,
5,4,"I ever seen.
"
,,
5,4,"And I've seen the Bangles in concert.
"
,,
5,4,"You! Where are you from, boy?
"
,,
5,4," Quahog.
"
,,
5,4," They only got two things in Quahog :
"
,,
5,4,"steers and queers.
"
,,
5,4,"I don't see no horns on you.
"
,,
5,4,"What does that make you, boy?
"
,,
5,4," Queer?
"
,,
5,4," Right!
"
,,
5,4," Oh, I got it?
"
,,
5,4," Yeah.
"
,,
5,4,"You find something funny, Private Dancer?
"
,,
5,4,"Dancer for money?!
"
,,
5,4,"Any old music will do?!
"
,,
5,4,"Well, actually, yeah, your last little,
"
,,
5,4,"uh, back-and-forth there with Stewie,
"
,,
5,4,"that whole queer thing,
"
,,
5,4,"that was actually pretty funny.
"
,,
5,4,"Oh, God!
"
,,
5,4,"Ooh, that's got to hurt worse
"
,,
5,4,"than getting a birthday telegram from
"
,,
5,4,"Zinedine Zidane.
"
,,
5,4,"Yes?
"
,,
5,4,"Bon anniversaire.
"
,,
5,4,"Yo, yo, what's up, James Woods High?!
"
,,
5,4,"I'm Chris, and this is our band,
"
,,
5,4,"Splash Log!
"
,,
5,4,"And we are gonna rock this place until...
"
,,
5,4,"un... well, until about 9:30,
"
,,
5,4,"'cause that's when the dance is over!
"
,,
5,4,"he'll point and show his teeth!</i>
"
,,
5,4,"Mayor West?
"
,,
5,4,"Quiet, young man. Can't you see
"
,,
5,4,"we're having a poker game?
"
,,
5,4,"Now, I'll ask again.
"
,,
5,4,"If I order a pizza,
"
,,
5,4,"will anyone else have some?
"
,,
5,4,"I might have a slice.
"
,,
5,4,"Well, you know, I'm gonna need more
"
,,
5,4,"of a commitment than that, Mark.
"
,,
5,4,"West Side Story, Anything Goes.
"
,,
5,4,"Two of my favorite Broadway shows.
"
,,
5,4,"Miss Saigon and Cabaret.
"
,,
5,4,"Overrated, I should say.
"
,,
5,4,"One, two, three, four.
"
,,
5,4,"Griffin! You got four legs there!
"
,,
5,4,"You better start using them!
"
,,
5,4,"I'm trying, sir.
"
,,
5,4,"You got five seconds
"
,,
5,4,"to get to the head of the pack,
"
,,
5,4,"or this entire platoon is gonna scrub
"
,,
5,4,"the latrines with their toothbrushes.
"
,,
5,4," Aw, come on, Brian!
"
,,
5,4," Don't screw us, Griffin!
"
,,
5,4," Yeah, come on,
"
,,
5,4," don't screw us, Brian Griffin!
"
,,
5,4,"Bill, how about thinking up
"
,,
5,4,"your own jeers for a change, huh?
"
,,
5,4,"Four! Three! Two!
"
,,
5,4," Oh, come on, Brian, get up!
"
,,
5,4," Time's up!
"
,,
5,4,"You're pathetic, Griffin!
"
,,
5,4,"Pathetic!
"
,,
5,4,"Whose half-eaten dead bird
"
,,
5,4,"is in this footlocker?
"
,,
5,4,"Let's say hypothetically that it
"
,,
5,4,"does belong to someone in here.
"
,,
5,4,"Would admission of that allow
"
,,
5,4,"that person to keep it?
"
,,
5,4,"Private Griffin, just for that,
"
,,
5,4,"you have to listen to one track
"
,,
5,4,"from this Chris Gaines album.
"
,,
5,4," Don't you think that's a little extreme?
"
,,
5,4," Two tracks!
"
,,
5,4,"It's so stupid,
"
,,
5,4,"it's just Garth Brooks in a wig.
"
,,
5,4," Three tracks!
"
,,
5,4," Come on!
"
,,
5,4," We can go all day with this!
"
,,
5,4," Yeah, but...
"
,,
5,4,"That's it! Every single track,
"
,,
5,4,"plus the hidden bonus track!
"
,,
5,4,"There's a hidden bonus track?
"
,,
5,4,"Oh, I hope it's a ballad.
"
,,
5,4,"Huh. Should I follow
"
,,
5,4,"the knight into the dungeon
"
,,
5,4,"or should I go back the way I came?
"
,,
5,4,"Eh, I'll follow the knight.
"
,,
5,4,"Page 37, page 37.
"
,,
5,4,"Aah! Aah! I mean, go back the way I came.
"
,,
5,4,"I didn't take my hand off the page.
"
,,
5,4,"You seen it, Lois, right?
"
,,
5,4,"You seen my hand on the page.
"
,,
5,4,"Yeah, Peter, I seen it.
"
,,
5,4,"Oh, no, not again.
"
,,
5,4,"You know, I'm glad
"
,,
5,4,"Chris found an activity he likes,
"
,,
5,4,"but why do they have to use our garage?
"
,,
5,4,"Come on, Lois, sometimes kids
"
,,
5,4,"can be a handful.
"
,,
5,4,"Look at Gregory Peck's kids.
"
,,
5,4," Are we there yet?
"
,,
5,4," It's crowded back here.
"
,,
5,4," Stop touching me.
"
,,
5,4," Your leg is rubbing up against mine.
"
,,
5,4,"Hey! Quiet down or I'm pulling over.
"
,,
5,4," Stop breathing on the window.
"
,,
5,4," You idiot.
"
,,
5,4,"That's condensation. It's on the outside.
"
,,
5,4,"That's it! I will come back there
"
,,
5,4,"and, so help me God,
"
,,
5,4,"I will hit you with my ring hand.
"
,,
5,4,"What the hell are you doing?
"
,,
5,4,"What does it look like I'm doing?
"
,,
5,4,"I'm leaving.
"
,,
5,4,"You can't leave, man. That's desertion.
"
,,
5,4,"They'll come after you like
"
,,
5,4,"Peter went after that hockey coach.
"
,,
5,4,"Oh, no clip?
"
,,
5,4,"Oh, thought we had a clip.
"
,,
5,4,"Nope. Okay.
"
,,
5,4,"Uh, you can't leave, Brian.
"
,,
5,4," You'll get life in prison.
"
,,
5,4," I'll take my chances.
"
,,
5,4,"Let me ask you this :
"
,,
5,4,"when was the last time you saw
"
,,
5,4,"something through to the end?
"
,,
5,4," Well, I, uh...
"
,,
5,4," Never, that's when!
"
,,
5,4,"You need this, Brian.
"
,,
5,4,"You dropped out of college.
"
,,
5,4,"You still haven't finished your novel.
"
,,
5,4,"Do you know what you lack?
"
,,
5,4,"Discipline!
"
,,
5,4,"And so you know where you'll get it?
"
,,
5,4,"Right here in the army!
"
,,
5,4,"Boy, you know what, you're right.
"
,,
5,4,"Everything I've ever done
"
,,
5,4,"I've crapped out on halfway through.
"
,,
5,4,"Well, not this time.
"
,,
5,4,"I am going to finish what I started.
"
,,
5,4,"That's the spirit!
"
,,
5,4,"You can do anything you put your mind to.
"
,,
5,4,"masturbate with you guys talking.</i>
"
,,
5,4,"Chris, will you knock that off
"
,,
5,4,"for 2 minutes? We want to talk to you.
"
,,
5,4,"Take five, guys.
"
,,
5,4,"What do you buttheads want?
"
,,
5,4,"You've been playing with your friends
"
,,
5,4,"long enough.
"
,,
5,4,"Now it's time for you to come inside
"
,,
5,4,"and do your homework.
"
,,
5,4,"It's time for you to piss off, redhead.
"
,,
5,4,"What?!
"
,,
5,4,"Hey, hey, Chris,
"
,,
5,4,"don't talk to your mother that way.
"
,,
5,4,"Oh, way to stand up
"
,,
5,4,"for your woman there, fatty.
"
,,
5,4,"Chris, what the hell
"
,,
5,4,"is going on with you lately?
"
,,
5,4,"Ever since you hooked up with this band,
"
,,
5,4,"you're like a completely different person,
"
,,
5,4,"and I don't like it one bit.
"
,,
5,4,"I am expressing myself!
"
,,
5,4,"Now, get out of my way!
"
,,
5,4,"I'm going to the park to loiter.
"
,,
5,4," What the hell is his problem?
"
,,
5,4," I don't know.
"
,,
5,4,"He's acting worse than you did when
"
,,
5,4,"you tried to cover your farts by coughing.
"
,,
5,4,"Okay, welcome to the PTA meeting.
"
,,
5,4,"On the subject of school lunches, I know
"
,,
5,4,"there's been some concern about nutrition...
"
,,
5,4,"We've had complaints
"
,,
5,4,"about the soda machines...
"
,,
5,4,"And I have spoken with the school board...
"
,,
5,4,"Is there something you'd like to say,
"
,,
5,4,"Mr. Griffin?
"
,,
5,4,"Uh...
"
,,
5,4,"Noooo...
"
,,
5,4,"No.
"
,,
5,4,"No, I'm good.
"
,,
5,4,"All right, men.
"
,,
5,4,"This obstacle course represents
"
,,
5,4,"the final test of your training.
"
,,
5,4,"Almost all of you have completed it
"
,,
5,4,"in the allotted time.
"
,,
5,4,"But as you know, as a unit,
"
,,
5,4,"you either all graduate,
"
,,
5,4,"or none of you graduate.
"
,,
5,4,"Griffin, it's up to you.
"
,,
5,4,"All right, you can do this, Brian.
"
,,
5,4,"Come on, pray with me.
"
,,
5,4,"Dear Lord...
"
,,
5,4,"just stay out of our way.
"
,,
5,4,"Okay, good luck.
"
,,
5,4,"And... go!
"
,,
5,4,"There's Waldo.
"
,,
5,4," Fresh pepper?
"
,,
5,4," Yes, thank you.
"
,,
5,4," Oh, that's plenty, thanks.
"
,,
5,4," None for me, thanks.
"
,,
5,4,"My boyfriend just dumped me.
"
,,
5,4,"There's a lot of fish in the sea.
"
,,
5,4,"It's always darkest before the dawn.
"
,,
5,4,"If it's not meant to be, it's not meant to be.
"
,,
5,4,"Thanks!
"
,,
5,4,"You did it, Brian! You did it!
"
,,
5,4,"Oh, I say, this is an even bigger
"
,,
5,4,"accomplishment than
"
,,
5,4,"getting Minnie Driver's head
"
,,
5,4,"to fit on screen.
"
,,
5,4,"Okay, back up.
"
,,
5,4,"Further.
"
,,
5,4," Move back some more.
"
,,
5,4," What?!
"
,,
5,4,"Back up some more.
"
,,
5,4,"I'm as far away as I can get.
"
,,
5,4,"Okay, have her enter.
"
,,
5,4,"Action!
"
,,
5,4,"Damn it. Cut!
"
,,
5,4,"Congratulations, men.
"
,,
5,4,"You've all passed basic training.
"
,,
5,4,"I'm proud to call you soldiers.
"
,,
5,4,"I'm sure you'll do your country proud
"
,,
5,4,"tomorrow morning,
"
,,
5,4,"when you're all shipped off to Iraq.
"
,,
5,4,"What?
"
,,
5,4,"Oh, don't worry.
"
,,
5,4,"I'm sure he means Fraggle Iraq.
"
,,
5,4," Well, this isn't so bad.
"
,,
5,4," Yes, the people are friendly.
"
,,
5,4,"I say, the media has totally blown
"
,,
5,4,"this whole thing out of proportion.
"
,,
5,4,"Okay, I go in store, I throw backpack.
"
,,
5,4,"Big boom.
"
,,
5,4,"No, no, no, you are big boom.
"
,,
5,4,"Big hero.
"
,,
5,4,"Okay, right, so I throw backpack,
"
,,
5,4,"come back and have big hero party
"
,,
5,4,"with many virgins.
"
,,
5,4,"No, no, no, no, no. You : boom.
"
,,
5,4,"Oh, okay, okay. I put on backpack, boom.
"
,,
5,4,"Then I come back, big hero, virgins.
"
,,
5,4,"Okay, yeah.
"
,,
5,4,"See you in a few minutes, big hero.
"
,,
5,4,"Ten-four, everything's Charlie 40-60.
"
,,
5,4,"What does that mean?
"
,,
5,4,"I don't know. I just thought you're
"
,,
5,4,"supposed to say names and numbers.
"
,,
5,4,"Nobody's corrected me so far.
"
,,
5,4,"What the hell was that?!
"
,,
5,4,"Uh, help! Help!
"
,,
5,4,"Uh, uh, I mean, ah, ah,
"
,,
5,4,"Charlie, Tango, Cash,
"
,,
5,4,"uh, 47, Victor, Charlie,
"
,,
5,4,"Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman!
"
,,
5,4,"Roger that.
"
,,
5,4,"We're moving to your position.
"
,,
5,4,"Chris, your father and I are very upset
"
,,
5,4,"by this new attitude of yours.
"
,,
5,4,"I don't care what you think of me!
"
,,
5,4,"Oh, God, I envy that.
"
,,
5,4,"I am so self-conscious
"
,,
5,4,"about what people think of me.
"
,,
5,4,"I am out of here!
"
,,
5,4,"You know, I think I may have an idea
"
,,
5,4,"what's causing this behavior, Peter.
"
,,
5,4,"Look at all this stuff.
"
,,
5,4,"Listen to these lyrics.
"
,,
5,4,"""I rip it hardcore like
"
,,
5,4,"porno-flick bitches.""
"
,,
5,4,"""I roll with groups of ghetto bastards
"
,,
5,4,"with biscuits.""
"
,,
5,4,"Oh, look, they've got a translation
"
,,
5,4,"for white people :
"
,,
5,4,"""I give 110 percent when it
"
,,
5,4,"comes to helping my community,""
"
,,
5,4,"""even though I occasionally associate
"
,,
5,4,"with some less than reputable characters.""
"
,,
5,4,"Peter, these lyrics are filthy.
"
,,
5,4,"All this violent music is
"
,,
5,4,"what's screwing Chris up.
"
,,
5,4,"What the hell?
"
,,
5,4,"Marilyn Manson!
"
,,
5,4,"Is that who's causing all this?
"
,,
5,4,"Yeah, it's all him or her's fault.
"
,,
5,4,"Who does he or she think he or she is?
"
,,
5,4,"Look, you can totally see
"
,,
5,4,"his or her nipples.
"
,,
5,4," That's obscene, maybe.
"
,,
5,4," There's only one thing to do.
"
,,
5,4,"You're right,
"
,,
5,4,"we got to find this Marilyn Manson
"
,,
5,4,"and I got to give that bastard or bitch
"
,,
5,4,"a piece of my mind or penis.
"
,,
5,4,"All right, it shouldn't be too hard
"
,,
5,4,"to get ourselves kicked out.
"
,,
5,4,"Right. We're just got to convince them
"
,,
5,4,"we're not army material.
"
,,
5,4," Ready?
"
,,
5,4," All right, let's do it.
"
,,
5,4,"Wow, look at how gay we are.
"
,,
5,4,"I am so gay, with my gayness.
"
,,
5,4,"Me, too.I'm...
"
,,
5,4,"I'm a homo.
"
,,
5,4," Any room for one more?
"
,,
5,4," Hell yeah!
"
,,
5,4,"All right, last resort.
"
,,
5,4,"We get injured and go home
"
,,
5,4,"with purple hearts.
"
,,
5,4,"Shoot me in the foot.
"
,,
5,4,"What?
"
,,
5,4,"Shoot yourself in the foot.
"
,,
5,4,"No, no, no, they can tell by the angle.
"
,,
5,4,"Here, you shoot me and I'll shoot you.
"
,,
5,4,"I don't think this is gonna work.
"
,,
5,4,"Of course it'll work. Ready? One...
"
,,
5,4,"two...
"
,,
5,4,"three!
"
,,
5,4,"Damn it! Oh, my God! That hurts!
"
,,
5,4," I think you missed me.
"
,,
5,4," All right, I'll try again.
"
,,
5,4,"Uh, no, no, no, hang, hang on.
"
,,
5,4,"That looks like it's painful.
"
,,
5,4,"Of course it's painful!
"
,,
5,4,"There's a bullet in my foot!
"
,,
5,4,"Now get over here!
"
,,
5,4,"No, no, no, no, no! I changed my mind!
"
,,
5,4," I don't want to do it!
"
,,
5,4," Come on, we had a deal!
"
,,
5,4,"No, no, no, no, don't point that at me!
"
,,
5,4,"No, no, no, oh, come on,
"
,,
5,4,"this is flat out just not safe!
"
,,
5,4,"Oh, you got me.
"
,,
5,4,"Ow. Ow. Ow.
"
,,
5,4," Let me see.
"
,,
5,4," No, no, it's gross.
"
,,
5,4," Let me see it.
"
,,
5,4," No, no, I don't want to gross you out.
"
,,
5,4,"Oh, ow, oh, we are in so much pain
"
,,
5,4,"right now, the two of us.
"
,,
5,4,"Oh, ow...
"
,,
5,4,"Okay, that was real!
"
,,
5,4,"Hey, hi, um, I'm Private Stewie
"
,,
5,4,"and this is Private Brian.
"
,,
5,4,"Uh, we both got shot in the foot,
"
,,
5,4,"so, uh, we figured an honorable
"
,,
5,4,"discharge would be in order
"
,,
5,4,"and, uh, you could just send us
"
,,
5,4,"back to the States.
"
,,
5,4,"Getting shot doesn't get you
"
,,
5,4,"out of here anymore.
"
,,
5,4,"What?
"
,,
5,4,"Yeah, we take whatever we can get.
"
,,
5,4,"I mean, we got two dead guys
"
,,
5,4,"guarding the ammunition.
"
,,
5,4,"Sorry, guys,
"
,,
5,4,"you are here until the job is done.
"
,,
5,4,"Great news, everybody.
"
,,
5,4,"Democracy just kicked in!
"
,,
5,4,"So it's over?
"
,,
5,4,"That seems unlikely.
"
,,
5,4,"Amazing.
"
,,
5,4,"There was only one man in the world with
"
,,
5,4,"the vision to predict something like this.
"
,,
5,4,"Damn.
"
,,
5,4,"Laura! Laura!
"
,,
5,4,"Laura!
"
,,
5,4,"And the Grammy
"
,,
5,4,"for Biggest Posse goes to...
"
,,
5,4,"Ja Rule.
"
,,
5,4,"What?!
"
,,
5,4,"No, Madonna. ""Posse.""
"
,,
5,4,"""Posse.""
"
,,
5,4,"Oh.
"
,,
5,4,"All right, Marilyn Manson
"
,,
5,4,"has to be here somewhere.
"
,,
5,4,"Good thing we distracted the guard
"
,,
5,4,"with that riddle.
"
,,
5,4,"What gets wetter as it dries...?
"
,,
5,4,"A towel.
"
,,
5,4,"Hey, I've been had!
"
,,
5,4,"Hey, look, right over there.
"
,,
5,4,"Hey, Manson!
"
,,
5,4,"What in the world was that for?
"
,,
5,4," Oh, it's a guy.
"
,,
5,4," That's for ruining our son.
"
,,
5,4,"He used to be a sweet boy
"
,,
5,4,"until he heard your music.
"
,,
5,4,"This old story.
"
,,
5,4,"If I had a nickel...
"
,,
5,4,"All right, where's your son?
"
,,
5,4,"he'll point and show his teeth!</i>
"
,,
5,4,"Chris? We brought someone
"
,,
5,4,"you might like to meet.
"
,,
5,4,"Oh, my God, Marilyn Manson!
"
,,
5,4,"Hey there, Chris.
"
,,
5,4,"You working hard or hardly working?
"
,,
5,4," So I see you're in a band.
"
,,
5,4," Yep.
"
,,
5,4,"Listen, your parents tell me
"
,,
5,4,"you've been acting out a little bit.
"
,,
5,4,"And I just wanted to tell you,
"
,,
5,4,"rock n' roll music is cool,
"
,,
5,4,"but respect for your elders
"
,,
5,4,"is a tune we can all dance to.
"
,,
5,4," Really?
"
,,
5,4," Sure.
"
,,
5,4,"And the best way to start a fun-filled
"
,,
5,4,"day of being a good citizen
"
,,
5,4,"is with a healthy breakfast
"
,,
5,4,"rich in breads and grains.
"
,,
5,4,"And fruits are important, too.
"
,,
5,4,"You mean like apples, oranges
"
,,
5,4,"and bananas?
"
,,
5,4,"Any of 'em, Chris. You can't miss.
"
,,
5,4,"And now, I think your parents
"
,,
5,4,"have something to say.
"
,,
5,4,"Chris, you don't really believe all the
"
,,
5,4,"things in those song lyrics, do you?
"
,,
5,4,"No.
"
,,
5,4,"Then why you been acting like
"
,,
5,4,"such a punk?
"
,,
5,4,"I guess I don't really know.
"
,,
5,4,"I think I have an idea.
"
,,
5,4,"Peter, when was the last time you
"
,,
5,4,"and Chris here did something together?
"
,,
5,4,"Boy, I guess it's been a while.
"
,,
5,4,"Here's something you might not know :
"
,,
5,4,"Children crave structure.
"
,,
5,4,"They enjoy the fun of planned activities
"
,,
5,4,"in which they and their parent or
"
,,
5,4,"guardian can share a common goal.
"
,,
5,4,"Maybe you could take Chris fishing.
"
,,
5,4,"What do you say, Chris?
"
,,
5,4,"You want to go fishing with your old man?
"
,,
5,4,"Do I?
"
,,
5,4,"Can't go without these.

"

5,5,"Oh, it was great.
"

5,5,"And guess what? I smuggled a whole
"

5,5,"bunch of fireworks back in my anus.
"

5,5,"Uh, Quagmire,
"
,,
5,5,"fireworks aren't illegal here.
"

5,5,"You could have just put them in your car
"

"

"

5,5,"to be safe.
"
,,
5,5,"Eh... good thinking.
"
,,
5,5,"Yeah, I know how these things go down.
"
,,
5,5,"Uh, hey there. We were supposed
"
,,
5,5,"to have brunch this morning.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, yeah, sorry.
"
,,
5,5,"I-I had a late night.
"
,,
5,5,"Late night, huh?
"
,,
5,5," What's her name, Brian?
"
,,
5,5," What are you talking about?
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, spare me the theatrics.
"
,,
5,5,"I see the signs.
"
,,
5,5,"The excuses for why we can't hang out,
"
,,
5,5,"the inside-out collar.
"
,,
5,5,"If I didn't recognize
"
,,
5,5,"what was going on here,
"
,,
5,5,"I'd have to be as dim as those retirees
"
,,
5,5,"I entertain every Thursday.
"
,,
5,5,"Whoa-ho-ho, all right.
"
,,
5,5,"We're getting a little faster here now.
"
,,
5,5,"And you know what?
"
,,
5,5,"I think there's something else down there
"
,,
5,5,"in the bottom of the sea.
"
,,
5,5,"Something that
"
,,
5,5,"you'll be able to relate to.
"
,,
5,5,"of the elderly man</i>
"
,,
5,5,"on the log</i>
"
,,
5,5,"of the elderly man</i>
"
,,
5,5,"on the log</i>
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, whoa, what is this?
"
,,
5,5,"on the frog</i> 
"
,,
5,5,"in the bottom of the sea</i>
"
,,
5,5,"Mr. Cohen in the hole</i>
"
,,
5,5,"Get a nurse.
"
,,
5,5,"Look, Brian, I think it's wonderful
"
,,
5,5,"you've found a young lady
"
,,
5,5,"willing to stoop to your level.
"
,,
5,5," When do I get to meet her?
"
,,
5,5," No, no, no way.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh... I see.
"
,,
5,5,"I get it, she's hideous.
"
,,
5,5,"She is not hideous.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, well, let me ask you something.
"
,,
5,5,"Does she have an alibi?
"
,,
5,5,"For what? Why would she need an alibi?
"
,,
5,5,"So you're saying she does not
"
,,
5,5,"have an alibi?
"
,,
5,5,"Well, no.
"
,,
5,5,"Okay, so we've established
"
,,
5,5,"she ain't got no alibi.
"
,,
5,5,"She ugly, she ugly!
"
,,
5,5,"U-G-L-Y!
"
,,
5,5,"She ain't got no alibi!
"
,,
5,5,"She ugly!
"
,,
5,5,"Screw off.
"
,,
5,5,"M, she's major ugly!
"
,,
5,5,"O, she's fat and pugly!
"
,,
5,5,"O, my God, no. 
"
,,
5,5,"The cow says ""moo."" 
"
,,
5,5,"Here's to Peter getting his fingers back.
"
,,
5,5,"Thanks, Joe.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, boy, I tell you,
"
,,
5,5,"I haven't felt this good
"
,,
5,5,"since I came up with that new place
"
,,
5,5,"to hide my porn.
"
,,
5,5,"Have a good day, sweetie.
"
,,
5,5,"Hey, Greg.
"
,,
5,5,"Afternoon, Mr. Griffin.
"
,,
5,5,"Mrs. Griffin out today?
"
,,
5,5," Shoppin'.
"
,,
5,5," Ah.
"
,,
5,5,"Ah, she's hot.
"
,,
5,5,"All right, last call, fellas.
"
,,
5,5,"It's closing time.
"
,,
5,5,"Aw, crap, I'm not even half-buzzed.
"
,,
5,5,"Hey, what do you guys say
"
,,
5,5,"we take this party on the road?
"
,,
5,5,"Fine by me.
"
,,
5,5,"Skinemax doesn't kick in with the
"
,,
5,5,"really dirty stuff till about 3:00 anyway.
"
,,
5,5,"They had one on last night
"
,,
5,5,"where the girl had a buttface
"
,,
5,5,"but her breasts was immaculate.
"
,,
5,5,"Peter, you sure it's okay
"
,,
5,5,"to beat the brewery after hours?
"
,,
5,5,"Relax, Joe, this is where I work.
"
,,
5,5,"Besides, it sure beats the hell out
"
,,
5,5,"of last Saturday
"
,,
5,5,"when we partied with that big-horned guy
"
,,
5,5,"from Legend.
"
,,
5,5,"Hey, you guys want to go to IHOP?
"
,,
5,5,"Get some breakfast or something?
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, God, I don't know, Big-Horned Guy.
"
,,
5,5,"It's like 3:00 a.m.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, that sucks, man, I'm wide awake.
"
,,
5,5,"Hey, Quagmire, you want to...
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
"
,,
5,5,"I'm sorry, man. Are you okay?
"
,,
5,5," No!
"
,,
5,5," I didn't see him.
"
,,
5,5,"Okay, okay, guys, here's one.
"
,,
5,5,"If you were God,
"
,,
5,5,"who would you strike down first?
"
,,
5,5,"Debra Messing. I find her insufferable.
"
,,
5,5,"French Stewart.
"
,,
5,5,"What are you squinting about?
"
,,
5,5,"It's not even that bright.
"
,,
5,5,"Yeah, he's terrible.
"
,,
5,5,"What we need out there now
"
,,
5,5,"is another Tim Daly.
"
,,
5,5," Who's Tim Daly?
"
,,
5,5," I don't even know who that is.
"
,,
5,5," From Wings?
"
,,
5,5," Nope.
"
,,
5,5,"Tim Daly. He was on Wings.
"
,,
5,5,"What, no-nobody here watched Wings?
"
,,
5,5,"Is that the one where there's a guy and
"
,,
5,5,"he's like, uh, he's a pilot or something?
"
,,
5,5,"There's two guys.
"
,,
5,5,"They're brothers and they're both pilots.
"
,,
5,5,"And wasn't there a fat guy
"
,,
5,5,"with a moustache?
"
,,
5,5,"That was Roy. He's hilarious.
"
,,
5,5," Was this a cartoon?
"
,,
5,5," No, my, oh, my god, no!
"
,,
5,5,"No, no, it took place in an airport.
"
,,
5,5,"Th-Th-The thing was on for ten years.
"
,,
5,5,"And the, and the funny repair guy
"
,,
5,5,"was Lowell.
"
,,
5,5,"It made Tony Shalhoub's career.
"
,,
5,5," Who?
"
,,
5,5," The tennis player?
"
,,
5,5,"God, you know what? Screw you guys.
"
,,
5,5,"I don't even know you.
"
,,
5,5,"Crazy people.
"
,,
5,5,"Living under a rock, don't know Wings.
"
,,
5,5,"I love Wings!
"
,,
5,5,"All right, I want to be very clear
"
,,
5,5,"about this.
"
,,
5,5,"You can meet her, chat for a minute,
"
,,
5,5,"and that's it. In and out.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, don't worry, Brian.
"
,,
5,5,"If she's as ugly as I think she is,
"
,,
5,5,"I'll look at her once and then I'll go...
"
,,
5,5,"...all over the place.
"
,,
5,5,"Then you'll wipe it up and then we'll go.
"
,,
5,5,"Hi, Brian.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, my God.
"
,,
5,5,"Who's your cute little friend?
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, my.
"
,,
5,5,"Hello. Stewie. Charmed.
"
,,
5,5,"I'm Jillian. Come on in.
"
,,
5,5,"Who wants a drink?
"
,,
5,5,"So, you gonna take back what you said?
"
,,
5,5,"Brian, she's stunning.
"
,,
5,5,"Okay, you met her, you can scram now.
"
,,
5,5,"I shall do no such thing.
"
,,
5,5,"Now, why in the world would you be
"
,,
5,5,"embarrassed about dating her?
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, my God, Brian.
"
,,
5,5,"I was watching something on TV
"
,,
5,5,"about this guy named Hitler.
"
,,
5,5,"Somebody should stop him.
"
,,
5,5,"Are her parents brother and sister?
"
,,
5,5,"Can you please leave now?
"
,,
5,5,"Oh... now I get it. She's a moron.
"
,,
5,5,"But a moron with large breasts
"
,,
5,5,"you can use as mountains
"
,,
5,5,"for your Matchbox cars, or whatever
"
,,
5,5,"it is grown-ups do with large breasts.
"
,,
5,5,"Shut up, that's not it at all.
"
,,
5,5,"Say, Jillian, I love what you've done
"
,,
5,5,"with the place.
"
,,
5,5,"What is it? One bedroom, one bath?
"
,,
5,5,"No, it's a whole apartment.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, God, outstanding.
"
,,
5,5,"So, Stewie. Do you work with Brian
"
,,
5,5,"at the detective agency?
"
,,
5,5,"Why, yes, as a matter of fact, I do.
"
,,
5,5,"At the detective agency.
"
,,
5,5,"That's got to be a tough job.
"
,,
5,5,"I know Brian's work has him coming
"
,,
5,5,"and going at all hours of the night.
"
,,
5,5,"I bet it does, I bet it does.
"
,,
5,5,"Okay, well, Stewie has to go now.
"
,,
5,5,"What are you talking about? I want some
"
,,
5,5,"more of Jillian's delicious lemonade.
"
,,
5,5,"I know, it's good, right?
"
,,
5,5,"I just wish they didn't have to kill
"
,,
5,5,"so many lemons to make it.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, this is fun, eh?
"
,,
5,5,"So, wait, Dupree moves in with
"
,,
5,5,"Kate Hudson and Matt Dillon?
"
,,
5,5,"But they're newlyweds, right?
"
,,
5,5,"Well, that's no time to have
"
,,
5,5,"a houseguest.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, gotta go.
"
,,
5,5,"Sorry, Angela. Every Tuesday morning,
"
,,
5,5,"I call my friend Cleveland
"
,,
5,5,"and he describes every scene from
"
,,
5,5,"You, Me, and Dupree.
"
,,
5,5,"Griffin, your workout put this week
"
,,
5,5,"is even worse than usual.
"
,,
5,5,"Where the hell are those purchase orders?
"
,,
5,5,"Eh, it's this bum hand.
"
,,
5,5,"I can't type with it.
"
,,
5,5,"Well, that's not my problem.
"
,,
5,5,"I need to see some improvement
"
,,
5,5,"by the end of the week
"
,,
5,5,"or you're finished.
"
,,
5,5,"Don't worry, I'll figure something out.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, that's going to be Quagmire
"
,,
5,5,"with Along Came Polly.
"
,,
5,5,"I gotta take that.
"
,,
5,5,"All right, so as you know by this point
"
,,
5,5,"in the story,
"
,,
5,5,"Ben Stiller doesn't like spicy food.
"
,,
5,5,"Well, guess what's for dinner?
"
,,
5,5,"No way.
"
,,
5,5,"Boy, Lois, thanks so much for coming in
"
,,
5,5,"and helping me get my work done.
"
,,
5,5,"Without you, Angela would have been
"
,,
5,5,"all over my case.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, it's all right, Peter.
"
,,
5,5,"I know it's tough for you to work
"
,,
5,5,"with your hand injury.
"
,,
5,5,"Hey, you know, uh,
"
,,
5,5,"with you sitting there, it's, uh,
"
,,
5,5,"it's kind of like you're my secretary.
"
,,
5,5,"Let's not get carried away, Peter.
"
,,
5,5,"Now, please, I'm trying to finish
"
,,
5,5,"your work.
"
,,
5,5,"You know, Lois, if I'm your boss,
"
,,
5,5,"I gotta look like a boss.
"
,,
5,5,"Finally, I have a reason to wear
"
,,
5,5,"this big bow tie and cigar
"
,,
5,5,"I bought at the Dress For Success store.
"
,,
5,5,"Peter, if you want this work
"
,,
5,5,"to get done...
"
,,
5,5,"Lois, take a letter.
"
,,
5,5,"""Dear Life Cereal,""
"
,,
5,5,"""Where do you get off?""
"
,,
5,5,"""Part of a balanced breakfast
"
,,
5,5,"and delicious?""
"
,,
5,5,"""Who do you think you are?""
"
,,
5,5,"""By now, you may have guessed
"
,,
5,5,"I'm speaking ironically""
"
,,
5,5,"""and have nothing but good things
"
,,
5,5,"to say about what you do.""
"
,,
5,5,"""Life Cereal, do not change a thing.""
"
,,
5,5,"""Signed, Peter Griffin.
"
,,
5,5,"Dictated but not read.""
"
,,
5,5,"Lois, read that back to me.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, hey, Brian. Back from a hot booty
"
,,
5,5,"call with your idiot girlfriend?
"
,,
5,5,"You know, think what you want, but you
"
,,
5,5,"don't see the side of Jillian that I do.
"
,,
5,5,"Face it, Brian, she's dumber than a
"
,,
5,5,"Boston-area book report.
"
,,
5,5,"The novel I chose to address
"
,,
5,5,"is Oliver Twist
"
,,
5,5,"by Charles Dickens.
"
,,
5,5,"Queer name, right?
"
,,
5,5,"The book was actually not bad.
"
,,
5,5,"For your information,
"
,,
5,5,"Jillian is very bright
"
,,
5,5,"and she happens to be a
"
,,
5,5,"very talented photographer.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, that is so lame.
"
,,
5,5,"Every hot girl who can aim a camera
"
,,
5,5,"thinks she's a photographer.
"
,,
5,5,"Ooh, you took a black and white picture
"
,,
5,5,"of a lawn chair
"
,,
5,5,"and its shadow and developed it at Sav-On.
"
,,
5,5,"You must be so brooding and deep.
"
,,
5,5," Knock it off.
"
,,
5,5," No, I want to know, Brian.
"
,,
5,5,"What, specifically, do you talk about?
"
,,
5,5,"Uh, a lot of things.
"
,,
5,5,"Um...
"
,,
5,5,"food,
"
,,
5,5,"um...
"
,,
5,5,"the new seat covers
"
,,
5,5,"she just got for her Jetta.
"
,,
5,5,"Um...
"
,,
5,5," Real World / Road Rules Challenge.
"
,,
5,5," You hate MTV.
"
,,
5,5,"Pot helps.
"
,,
5,5,"Look, you know, I don't have to justify
"
,,
5,5,"anything to you, all right?
"
,,
5,5,"All that matters is Jillian and I have
"
,,
5,5,"a great time together.
"
,,
5,5," We make each other laugh.
"
,,
5,5," Fine.
"
,,
5,5,"But just tell me this, Brian :
"
,,
5,5,"does she laugh on her own
"
,,
5,5,"or does she laugh only when you laugh?
"
,,
5,5,"I thought so.
"
,,
5,5,"Hey.
"
,,
5,5,"Yeah.
"
,,
5,5,"Uh-huh...
"
,,
5,5,"uh-huh.
"
,,
5,5,"Uh, you gotta hit, uh, DVD and then menu
"
,,
5,5,"and then select.
"
,,
5,5,"Yeah.
"
,,
5,5,"Yeah, the DVD needs to be face up
"
,,
5,5,"when you put it in.
"
,,
5,5,"Uh-huh.
"
,,
5,5,"You should be able to see
"
,,
5,5,"the words Mr. 3000.
"
,,
5,5,"Yeah...
"
,,
5,5,"still nothing?
"
,,
5,5,"Is it plugged in?
"
,,
5,5,"Okay, so plug it in.
"
,,
5,5,"Okay.
"
,,
5,5,"Y-You got it?
"
,,
5,5,"Is it... uh, okay. All right.
"
,,
5,5,"No, no problem. All right.
"
,,
5,5,"Uh, love you, too, Jilly bean.
"
,,
5,5,"Okay.
"
,,
5,5," What?
"
,,
5,5," Nothing. I didn't say anything.
"
,,
5,5,"I need a drink.
"
,,
5,5,"Uh, hey, uh, Jilly bean?
"
,,
5,5,"Hey, it's Brian again.
"
,,
5,5,"Uh, so, yeah, um...
"
,,
5,5,"so I figured we could get together
"
,,
5,5,"tonight and maybe, um,
"
,,
5,5,"do all those things sexually
"
,,
5,5,"that we usually do.
"
,,
5,5,"Um, what were those again?
"
,,
5,5,"No way, gross!
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, I mean, I mean, oh, oh, no.
"
,,
5,5,"Yeah, I totally love how that feels.
"
,,
5,5,"Hi.
"
,,
5,5,"You know, I've been noticing you
"
,,
5,5,"around the steno pool.
"
,,
5,5,"You look good enough for a promotion.
"
,,
5,5,"Peter, cut it out.
"
,,
5,5,"Hey, that's no way to talk to your boss.
"
,,
5,5,"Mmm, is that Pert?
"
,,
5,5,"You know it is.
"
,,
5,5,"Smell my Speed Stick?
"
,,
5,5,"Peter, what the hell are you doing?
"
,,
5,5,"Lois, I'm gonna come right out with it.
"
,,
5,5,"I think it would be so hot for you and
"
,,
5,5,"me to have sex in my office.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, my God.
"
,,
5,5,"There is no way that is gonna happen.
"
,,
5,5,"You know, it's no wonder
"
,,
5,5,"you're so far behind in your work
"
,,
5,5,"if this is how you behave at the office.
"
,,
5,5,"Come on, just touch it. Touch yours.
"
,,
5,5,"Peter, no. I have work to do
"
,,
5,5,"so you can keep your job.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, look at me, I'm Lois.
"
,,
5,5,"I'm a worker. I make stuff on things.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, I'll file these later.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, I got a phone. Nope, that's it.
"
,,
5,5,"Geez, Lois, I thought having you here
"
,,
5,5,"was gonna be fun,
"
,,
5,5,"but so far you're a bigger buzzkill
"
,,
5,5,"than Buzz Killington.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, man, this is the best party
"
,,
5,5,"I've ever been to.
"
,,
5,5,"Evening, everyone.
"
,,
5,5,"I thought it would be very droll if
"
,,
5,5,"we all sat down and looked at etchings.
"
,,
5,5,"Would you like to join me, Peter?
"
,,
5,5,"Uh, well, we-we're kinda partying here.
"
,,
5,5,"Good! Hold this up.
"
,,
5,5,"Now here's a fellow attempting
"
,,
5,5,"to ride a bicycle.
"
,,
5,5,"But he's having some trouble, isn't he?
"
,,
5,5,"Would you like to know why?
"
,,
5,5,"Why?
"
,,
5,5,"Because he's a Scot!
"
,,
5,5,"Now, who here likes a good story
"
,,
5,5,"about a bridge?
"
,,
5,5,"What the hell? Jillian, what...
"
,,
5,5," What are you doing here?
"
,,
5,5," Oh, hi, Brian.
"
,,
5,5,"It was so nice of you to invite
"
,,
5,5,"your girlfriend over for dinner.
"
,,
5,5," I invited her for dinner?
"
,,
5,5," Yes, you did.
"
,,
5,5,"You wanted her to meet the family.
"
,,
5,5,"Now, come here, Brian.
"
,,
5,5,"Come sit by your friend, Stewie.
"
,,
5,5,"And then, think about this :
"
,,
5,5,"have you ever seen the sun and the moon
"
,,
5,5,"in the same place at the same time?
"
,,
5,5,"They're the same person!
"
,,
5,5," I know, right?!
"
,,
5,5," You're brilliant!
"
,,
5,5,"Hey, Oogie!
"
,,
5,5,"So tell us, Oogie,
"
,,
5,5,"where'd you find this one, huh?
"
,,
5,5,"You two meet at a Mensa meeting?
"
,,
5,5,"No, at a Quizno's.
"
,,
5,5,"We both ordered the
"
,,
5,5,"Turkey Ranchand Swiss, no onions.
"
,,
5,5,"Can you believe that?
"
,,
5,5,"No, wow.
"
,,
5,5,"What are the odds?
"
,,
5,5,"Well, hey, what are the odds of
"
,,
5,5,"finding true love anywhere in the world
"
,,
5,5,"says this observer.
"
,,
5,5,"Hey, you wanna know something cool?
"
,,
5,5,"I threw up a lot in high school,
"
,,
5,5,"so I don't get my period anymore.
"
,,
5,5,"Wow, this is the one you've been
"
,,
5,5,"waiting for, huh, Brian?
"
,,
5,5,"Are you serious?
"
,,
5,5,"Are you serious, Brian?
"
,,
5,5,"All right, you know what,
"
,,
5,5,"Lois, don't judge.
"
,,
5,5,"Because you don't know what two people
"
,,
5,5,"are like when they're alone.
"
,,
5,5,"Come on. Let's go out dancing.
"
,,
5,5,"I don't know, I'm feeling kinda
"
,,
5,5,"cozy tonight. Kinda mellow.
"
,,
5,5,"I just really want to go dancing...
"
,,
5,5,"Oh!
"
,,
5,5,"There it is again!
"
,,
5,5,"What is that?
"
,,
5,5,"So, Jillian, what are your views
"
,,
5,5,"regarding homeland security?
"
,,
5,5,"Do you think we should support
"
,,
5,5,"what the president is doing?
"
,,
5,5,"Well, I just think, for starters,
"
,,
5,5,"that sometimes the government has things
"
,,
5,5,"they can't tell us
"
,,
5,5,"and, truthishly, we should just
"
,,
5,5,"accept that.
"
,,
5,5,"Okay, goodnight, everyone.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, say, Jillian, before you go.
"
,,
5,5,"I forget.
"
,,
5,5,"Do you know what the capital
"
,,
5,5,"of this state is?
"
,,
5,5,"Um... Rhode Island City?
"
,,
5,5,"It's like she's (bleep) five!
"
,,
5,5,"Thanks for hanging out with my friends,
"
,,
5,5,"Brian.
"
,,
5,5,"Hey, come on.
"
,,
5,5,"We're-we're a legitimate couple, right?
"
,,
5,5,"I-I should be able to talk
"
,,
5,5,"with your friends.
"
,,
5,5,"So then the valet pulls up and I'm all,
"
,,
5,5,"""That is so not my car.""
"
,,
5,5,"But then it totally was.
"
,,
5,5," That's happened to me!
"
,,
5,5," Me, too.
"
,,
5,5,"Cars go fast.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, God.
"
,,
5,5,"Yeah, I tell ya, if I had a nickel for
"
,,
5,5,"every time that happened.
"
,,
5,5," Yeah...?
"
,,
5,5," What?
"
,,
5,5,"What if you had a nickel
"
,,
5,5,"for every time that happened?
"
,,
5,5,"No, nothing. It's just an expression.
"
,,
5,5,"A what?
"
,,
5,5,"Well, I was just saying
"
,,
5,5,"I do my share of dopey stuff.
"
,,
5,5,"Like, oh, this... this one time
"
,,
5,5,"I attended a speaker's colloquium
"
,,
5,5,"on federal judgeships
"
,,
5,5,"and without realizing it,
"
,,
5,5,"I kept calling William Rehnquist
"
,,
5,5,"""William Rhinequist.""
"
,,
5,5,"Come on.
"
,,
5,5,"I mean, how... ""doi.""
"
,,
5,5,"Anyone else have to go to
"
,,
5,5,"the littlegirls' room?
"
,,
5,5,"I have new gloss!
"
,,
5,5," I love gloss!
"
,,
5,5," Oh, that rocks!
"
,,
5,5,"Gloss rhymes with hair!
"
,,
5,5,"Dude, that was painful.
"
,,
5,5,"What are you doing here?
"
,,
5,5,"Did you follow us?
"
,,
5,5,"Brian, why can't you just admit
"
,,
5,5,"what's going on here?
"
,,
5,5,"Okay, okay. Fine. Fine.
"
,,
5,5,"I'm gonna have to break it off.
"
,,
5,5,"But, boy, it's gonna be tougher than
"
,,
5,5,"the reviews for Our American Cousin.
"
,,
5,5,"Blah, blah, blah, ""Lincoln assassinated,""
"
,,
5,5,"blah, blah, blah,
"
,,
5,5,"""tragedy for our Republic.""
"
,,
5,5,"Uh... oh, look!
"
,,
5,5,"""Ably performed by the entire ensemble.""
"
,,
5,5,"Morning, Lois, I need you to
"
,,
5,5,"proof read this and collate it for me.
"
,,
5,5,"Peter, did you Xerox your penis?
"
,,
5,5,"Flip through it or you're fired.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, my God! This is disgusting.
"
,,
5,5,"Peter, for the last time, I'm not
"
,,
5,5,"having sex with you in this office.
"
,,
5,5,"Why the hell are you pushing
"
,,
5,5,"this so hard?
"
,,
5,5,"Because, Lois, I already wrote the letter
"
,,
5,5,"to ""Penthouse Forum,""
"
,,
5,5,"and I don't wanna be made a liar
"
,,
5,5,"in the nudie magazine of record.
"
,,
5,5,"All right.
"
,,
5,5,"If I give you 30 seconds of making out,
"
,,
5,5,"will that shut you up?
"
,,
5,5,"Let's see where it goes.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, God, you know this is pretty hot.
"
,,
5,5,"Yeah, what'd I tell you, huh?
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, God, Peter, let's do it.
"
,,
5,5,"Let's do it right here, right now!
"
,,
5,5,"Lois, Lois wait. Wait.
"
,,
5,5,"Opie's right there.
"
,,
5,5,"I want him to look, Peter.
"
,,
5,5,"Well, that is the last of it.
"
,,
5,5,"You are now all caught up with your work.
"
,,
5,5,"Lois, I really appreciate you helping
"
,,
5,5,"me out this week,
"
,,
5,5,"and I really appreciate
"
,,
5,5,"you having sex with me in my office.
"
,,
5,5,"Well, that was my pleasure, too, Peter.
"
,,
5,5,"Haa, I knew I'd get you.
"
,,
5,5,"Just like Danny DeVito got Rhea Perlman.
"
,,
5,5,"I don't know, Danny.
"
,,
5,5,"Look, it's either me or nobody.
"
,,
5,5,"Sold.
"
,,
5,5,"All right, Brian, you can do this.
"
,,
5,5,"You can dump her.
"
,,
5,5,"Because once it's done,
"
,,
5,5,"never again will you have to listen
"
,,
5,5,"to her talk like this?
"
,,
5,5,"You know, where everything has
"
,,
5,5,"a question mark at the end of it?
"
,,
5,5,"With an upward inflection?
"
,,
5,5,"At the end of every sentence?
"
,,
5,5,"Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking?
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, damn it. Now I'm doing it, too.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, hey, Oogie.
"
,,
5,5,"Ooh, you look tense.
"
,,
5,5,"Well, uh, Jillian, there's...
"
,,
5,5,"something we need to talk about.
"
,,
5,5,"What is it?
"
,,
5,5,"I, uh...
"
,,
5,5,"just wanted to spend some time with you.
"
,,
5,5,"What the hell? It took you three hours
"
,,
5,5,"to break up with her?
"
,,
5,5,"Uh, not exactly.
"
,,
5,5,"Well, what were you doing in there?
"
,,
5,5,"What's that smell? It smells like
"
,,
5,5,"sweat and anger and shame.
"
,,
5,5,"Yep.
"
,,
5,5,"Life's confusing when you grow up,
"
,,
5,5,"isn't it, Brian?
"
,,
5,5,"It is.
"
,,
5,5," Can we play my mix tape?
"
,,
5,5," Yeah, go ahead.
"
,,
5,5,"Oh, you're a poor sport.

"
,,
5,6," Rodney, did you take out the trash?
"

5,6," Um, I forgot.
"
,,
5,6,"Oh, no she di-in't.
"
,,
5,6,"Pizza for Adam West.
"
,,
5,6,"No. You gave me Canadian bacon
"
,,
5,6,"instead of bacon?
"
,,
5,6,"This misdeed cannot go unpunished.
"
,,
5,6,"Pizza delivery man, prepare to meet your
"
,,
5,6,"maker at the hands of my cat launcher.
"
,,
5,6,"Hey, look, somebody tried to break
"
,,
5,6,"into the dirty movie store.
"
,,
5,6,"Quick, grab as many as you can
"
,,
5,6,"before someone sees us.
"
,,
5,6,"Damn, I lost him.
"
,,
5,6,"All right, cats, back in the bag.
"
,,
5,6,"Come on, Fluffy.
"
,,
5,6,"Come on, Mittens. Come on, Paul.
"
,,
5,6,"What a ridiculous name for a cat.
"
,,
5,6,"Paul! That's a person's name.
"
,,
5,6,"A person's name.
"
,,
5,6,"Oh, Paul.
"
,,
5,6,"Oh, man, this is going to be great.
"
,,
5,6," Oh, are we watching a movie?
"
,,
5,6," The lab results are back.
"
,,
5,6,"You've tested positive for nymphomania.
"
,,
5,6,"Oh, no, what should I do?
"
,,
5,6,"Take two of these and call us
"
,,
5,6,"in the morning.
"
,,
5,6,"Oh, now that's not going
"
,,
5,6,"to help her nymphomania.
"
,,
5,6,"It's only going to exacerbate it.
"
,,
5,6,"Oh, my God, what are you kids doing?
"
,,
5,6,"Out. Everybody out.
"
,,
5,6,"That's bogus.
"
,,
5,6," Chris, what is this?
"
,,
5,6," Genital Hospital.
"
,,
5,6,"Yes, and it's inappropriate
"
,,
5,6,"for someone your age.
"
,,
5,6,"Now, if you're curious about sex,
"
,,
5,6,"you should talk to your sex ed teacher.
"
,,
5,6,"We don't have one. The principal
"
,,
5,6,"cut sex ed class to save money.
"
,,
5,6,"What? Well, that's crazy.
"
,,
5,6,"Without sex ed, kids can wind up
"
,,
5,6,"sexually confused.
"
,,
5,6,"Just look at Michael Jackson.
"
,,
5,6,"The kid in me likes the frosted side...
"
,,
5,6,"but the grown-up in me
"
,,
5,6,"likes the kid in me.
"
,,
5,6,"Peter, do you know they're not teaching
"
,,
5,6,"sex ed at Chris' school?
"
,,
5,6,"Eh, let them figure it out the way
"
,,
5,6,"I had to.
"
,,
5,6,"With a can of Crisco and a shot glass.
"
,,
5,6,"That's the natural way, Lois.
"
,,
5,6,"That's the natural way.
"
,,
5,6,"Well, somebody's got to step in.
"
,,
5,6,"Tomorrow, I'm going down to
"
,,
5,6,"James Woods High
"
,,
5,6,"and offer to teach the class myself.
"
,,
5,6,"Hey, you could really make a difference.
"
,,
5,6,"Like I did when I taught money
"
,,
5,6,"management to those drug addicts.
"
,,
5,6,"There's a lot of ways for you guys
"
,,
5,6,"to save money.
"
,,
5,6,"For example, you're all shooting up,
"
,,
5,6,"why not share needles?
"
,,
5,6,"That's a no-brainer. More money in
"
,,
5,6,"your wallet, more drugs in your veins.
"
,,
5,6,"My second piece of advice :
"
,,
5,6,"have as many kids as you can,
"
,,
5,6,"'cause that makes it more likely
"
,,
5,6,"that one of those kids'll grow up
"
,,
5,6,"and make it big in Hollywood.
"
,,
5,6,"Then who's paying the bills, eh?
"
,,
5,6,"Hollywood kid.
"
,,
5,6,"Class dismissed.
"
,,
5,6,"Good morning, everyone.
"
,,
5,6,"I'm Mrs. Griffin,
"
,,
5,6,"your new sex ed teacher.
"
,,
5,6,"Now, you've probably heard all those rumors
"
,,
5,6,"that condoms make sex less pleasurable.
"
,,
5,6,"While that is a fact,
"
,,
5,6,"they also make sex safer.
"
,,
5,6,"Sorry I'm late, Lois.
"
,,
5,6,"Peter, what are you doing here?
"
,,
5,6,"Lois, you think I'm going
"
,,
5,6,"to miss a chance to share
"
,,
5,6,"my knowledge with these
"
,,
5,6,"fresh young minds?
"
,,
5,6,"Forget it, I've missed too many
"
,,
5,6,"other opportunities.
"
,,
5,6," There he is.
"
,,
5,6," Took you long enough.
"
,,
5,6," Just what we need.
"
,,
5,6," Hey, guys, I'm coming in.
"
,,
5,6," Oh, God.
"
,,
5,6," Oh, God.
"
,,
5,6,"Oh, boy.
"
,,
5,6,"I am not going to hear the end of this.
"
,,
5,6," You jackass.
"
,,
5,6," Now you've done it.
"
,,
5,6,"Idiot.
"
,,
5,6,"I know I don't fit here,
"
,,
5,6,"but I'm just going to settle right in.
"
,,
5,6,"All right, Peter, you can stay,
"
,,
5,6,"but remember, this is my class.
"
,,
5,6,"Now, there are a number of natural ways
"
,,
5,6,"that males and females interact.
"
,,
5,6,"That's right, allow me to demonstrate.
"
,,
5,6,"Hey, Rainbow Brite.
"
,,
5,6,"Hello, Shakespeare.
"
,,
5,6,"I am all done writing plays for the day,
"
,,
5,6,"perhaps we could have sexual intercourse?
"
,,
5,6,"Count me in.
"
,,
5,6,"I say, look at this.
"
,,
5,6,"This toy has small parts.
"
,,
5,6,"Why the devil would they include
"
,,
5,6,"small parts?
"
,,
5,6,"Unless...
"
,,
5,6,"I'm supposed to eat them.
"
,,
5,6,"Of course, it all adds up!
"
,,
5,6,"Oh, dear God, I've lost a tooth.
"
,,
5,6,"Dude, you're lucky.
"
,,
5,6,"If you put that under your pillow,
"
,,
5,6,"the Tooth Fairy will come
"
,,
5,6,"and give you a dollar.
"
,,
5,6,"What?
"
,,
5,6,"Did you say the Tooth Fairy comes here?
"
,,
5,6,"To our house?
"
,,
5,6,"She just breaks in like some hood?
"
,,
5,6,"Yeah, she creeps into your house at night
"
,,
5,6,"and comes into your room while you sleep.
"
,,
5,6,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
5,6,"And sometimes, just for the hell of it,
"
,,
5,6,"she cuts off a piece of her armpit hair
"
,,
5,6,"and places it gently on your tongue.
"
,,
5,6,"Oh, oh, God! Oh, God, I got to get
"
,,
5,6,"out of here! I got to get out of here!
"
,,
5,6,"Stewie, calm down.
"
,,
5,6,"Get a hold of yourself.
"
,,
5,6,"Here, Brian, let me handle this.
"
,,
5,6,"Calm down.
"
,,
5,6,"Everything's going to be all right.
"
,,
5,6,"Chris, you're wanted on the phone.
"
,,
5,6,"Everything's going to be all right.
"
,,
5,6,"Hey, Lois, I wanted to get some K-Y Jelly
"
,,
5,6,"for the class today, but they were
"
,,
5,6,"all out so I got Smucker's.
"
,,
5,6,"Peter, I don't know
"
,,
5,6,"what you think you're doing,
"
,,
5,6,"but you ruined my sex ed class. There's
"
,,
5,6,"no way you're coming with me again.
"
,,
5,6,"Fine,
"
,,
5,6,"but without my advice, those kids are
"
,,
5,6,"going to be as hopeless as Liam Neeson
"
,,
5,6,"when he tries to play an
"
,,
5,6,"American cowboy.
"
,,
5,6,"But, Montana, when will you be back?
"
,,
5,6,"That's none of your concern.
"
,,
5,6,"You got to take care of the offspring.
"
,,
5,6,"Gonna take a fortnight at least to get
"
,,
5,6,"this herd down to St. Louis on Mississippi.
"
,,
5,6,"This glen's gonna be tough to traverse,
"
,,
5,6,"and that river's got to be 50,
"
,,
5,6,"And God knows how many fathoms.
"
,,
5,6,"To hell with parliamentary procedure.
"
,,
5,6,"We've got to wrangle up some cattles.
"
,,
5,6,"What is going on here?
"
,,
5,6,"We're all protesting the sex ed class
"
,,
5,6,"that's being taught to our children.
"
,,
5,6,"Mrs. Griffin, I'm sorry to have
"
,,
5,6,"to tell you this,
"
,,
5,6,"but the school board has voted
"
,,
5,6,"to cancel your sex ed class.
"
,,
5,6,"Look, Principal Shepherd, I know
"
,,
5,6,"my husband acted inappropriately...
"
,,
5,6,"Oh, it's not because of your husband.
"
,,
5,6,"It's because you're teaching those kids
"
,,
5,6,"about condoms.
"
,,
5,6,"What? That's ridiculous.
"
,,
5,6,"These students have the
"
,,
5,6,"right to information about safe sex.
"
,,
5,6,"Well, these parents don't think so.
"
,,
5,6,"I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin. You're fired.
"
,,
5,6,"Fired?! Oh, no.
"
,,
5,6,"I can't believe they fired you.
"
,,
5,6,"Can't you go down the school
"
,,
5,6,"and try to reason with them?
"
,,
5,6,"No, I'm banned from school property.
"
,,
5,6,"The PTA doesn't want me around
"
,,
5,6,"their children.
"
,,
5,6,"Well, Lois, I think you did
"
,,
5,6,"the right thing
"
,,
5,6,"by trying to inform these kids
"
,,
5,6,"about safe sex.
"
,,
5,6,"And if the parents don't like it,
"
,,
5,6,"that's their loss.
"
,,
5,6,"That's the problem, though.
"
,,
5,6,"It isn't their loss, it's the kids' loss.
"
,,
5,6,"I just hope they're getting
"
,,
5,6,"the information they need.
"
,,
5,6,"All right, students,
"
,,
5,6,"we have a special speaker today
"
,,
5,6,"who's going to educate you about sex.
"
,,
5,6,"Please welcome from the
"
,,
5,6,"First Evangelical Church,
"
,,
5,6,"the Reverend Jerry Kirkwood
"
,,
5,6,"and the Opal Ring Crusade.
"
,,
5,6,"Hey, kids, put your Walkmans down
"
,,
5,6,"and listen up.
"
,,
5,6,"'Cause we're going to talk about sex.
"
,,
5,6,"God, what are you doing here?
"
,,
5,6,"to see The Matrix.</i>
"
,,
5,6," We can relate to that.
"
,,
5,6," No fake.
"
,,
5,6,"Well, God, I am here to talk to
"
,,
5,6,"these kids about sex.
"
,,
5,6,"And why they shouldn't be having it.
"
,,
5,6,"Hey, you kids like Mad TV?
"
,,
5,6,"Well, we've got something almost as good.
"
,,
5,6,"Here they are... The Opal Ring Players.
"
,,
5,6,"Boy, I sure had fun
"
,,
5,6,"at the pizza parlor tonight, Debbie.
"
,,
5,6,"Yeah, Matthew,
"
,,
5,6,"that pizza pie was delicious.
"
,,
5,6,"Hey, watch out, crazy driver.
"
,,
5,6,"That joker must have been
"
,,
5,6,"from Jefferson High.
"
,,
5,6,"They're our rivals.
"
,,
5,6,"Well, here we are at the make-out point.
"
,,
5,6,"Yeah. You want to go all the way?
"
,,
5,6,"Freeze! Now, who can tell me
"
,,
5,6,"what Matthew just did wrong?
"
,,
5,6,"I mean, besides not running over
"
,,
5,6,"that yahoo from Jefferson High.
"
,,
5,6,"They're our rivals.
"
,,
5,6,"He's wrong 'cause he wants to have sex
"
,,
5,6,"and he's not married.
"
,,
5,6," Bingo.
"
,,
5,6," Wow, you're pretty smart.
"
,,
5,6," Thanks. My name's Doug.
"
,,
5,6," I'm Meg.
"
,,
5,6,"Now, look, let's rap for a second.
"
,,
5,6,"He's sitting informally like us.
"
,,
5,6,"Let's hear what he has to say.
"
,,
5,6,"Jefferson High is our rival.
"
,,
5,6,"Sure, sex if fun, but you can't have it
"
,,
5,6,"before you're married,
"
,,
5,6,"even if you use a condom.
"
,,
5,6,"Because not only to condoms fail
"
,,
5,6,"they're also majorly unsafe.
"
,,
5,6,"Hey, you wouldn't put a plastic bag
"
,,
5,6,"over your grandmother's head, would you?
"
,,
5,6,"No.
"
,,
5,6,"And that's why we're gonna be
"
,,
5,6,"handing out these opal rings.
"
,,
5,6,"These rings are a symbol of
"
,,
5,6,"your commitment
"
,,
5,6,"to refrain from sex until you're married.
"
,,
5,6,"So what do you say?
"
,,
5,6,"Who wants to be joyful?
"
,,
5,6,"Who wants to be pure?
"
,,
5,6,"Who wants to be... abstinent?
"
,,
5,6," Wow, he makes so much sense.
"
,,
5,6," I know, he's a visionary,
"
,,
5,6,"like Gandhi or Mozart or Picasso.
"
,,
5,6,"Ladies and gentlemen, my newest work.
"
,,
5,6,"Now, I know this person looks
"
,,
5,6,"a little mixed up,
"
,,
5,6,"but, watch carefully.
"
,,
5,6,"If I move this down here,
"
,,
5,6,"and this over here,
"
,,
5,6,"and this part here...
"
,,
5,6,"Anyone tell who it is yet?
"
,,
5,6,"No?
"
,,
5,6,"Okay, well, what if I move this here
"
,,
5,6,"and this here...
"
,,
5,6,"Then it's Dianne Wiest.
"
,,
5,6,"All right, men, your mission tonight
"
,,
5,6,"is to stave off
"
,,
5,6,"the invading forces of the Tooth Fairy.
"
,,
5,6,"SpongeBob, you watch the East.
"
,,
5,6,"StarScream, you take the West.
"
,,
5,6,"And Man-E-Faces, you take center patrol
"
,,
5,6,"since you have many faces.
"
,,
5,6,"Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
"
,,
5,6,"It's morning.
"
,,
5,6,"Is it?
"
,,
5,6,"Ha! I knew it! I scared her off.
"
,,
5,6,"Uh, you might want to check
"
,,
5,6,"under your pillow.
"
,,
5,6,"How did she get in?
"
,,
5,6,"She must have been quieter than
"
,,
5,6,"Britney Spears' dietician.
"
,,
5,6,"Ea-Easy on those trans fats.
"
,,
5,6,"N-Not everything needs gravy.
"
,,
5,6,"You know, there's some carrots
"
,,
5,6,"down at the other end.
"
,,
5,6,"That-that cheesecake was for everyone.
"
,,
5,6,"Her hand was right beneath my pillow.
"
,,
5,6,"She could have snapped my neck
"
,,
5,6,"if she had a mind to.
"
,,
5,6,"Don't worry about it. I'm sure it will be
"
,,
5,6,"a while before you lose another tooth.
"
,,
5,6,"I can't wait for that.
"
,,
5,6,"I have to lure her back on my terms
"
,,
5,6,"and kill her myself!
"
,,
5,6,"But to catch a fairy,
"
,,
5,6,"I have to think like a fairy.
"
,,
5,6,"""Well, that'll be a stretch,""</i>
"
,,
5,6,"""I'm not touching that one,""</i>
"
,,
5,6,"""Arriba!"" and dance around a sombrero,</i>
"
,,
5,6,"Arriba!
"
,,
5,6," Like, right?
"
,,
5,6," I know.
"
,,
5,6," Whatever, because ""duh!""
"
,,
5,6," I know, right?
"
,,
5,6,"Whatever, because I mean,
"
,,
5,6,"like, totally full out.
"
,,
5,6," Full on.
"
,,
5,6," Right?
"
,,
5,6,"I guess it's not easy growing up
"
,,
5,6,"anywhere.
"
,,
5,6,"Hey, Dad, check out my abstinence ring.
"
,,
5,6,"It means I made a pledge not to have sex.
"
,,
5,6,"That's crazy! You can't give up sex.
"
,,
5,6,"You've got a responsibility.
"
,,
5,6,"You see, Meg, you're what they call
"
,,
5,6,"a ""practice girl.""
"
,,
5,6,"Dad, look at the facts about sex.
"
,,
5,6,"""If you have sex, your penis will fall
"
,,
5,6,"off and land in another dimension""
"
,,
5,6,"""populated entirely by dogs
"
,,
5,6,"who will eat it.""
"
,,
5,6,"Well, that's something I'd like to avoid.
"
,,
5,6,"Well, this changes everything.
"
,,
5,6,"From now on, I, too, will be obstinate.
"
,,
5,6," Abstinent.
"
,,
5,6," Absinthe.
"
,,
5,6," Abstinent.
"
,,
5,6," You're grounded.
"
,,
5,6,"All right, getting a tooth to lure
"
,,
5,6,"that damn fairy back shouldn't be
"
,,
5,6,"too difficult.
"
,,
5,6,"I'd love to dance, Fred Savage.
"
,,
5,6,"Gosh, Meg, I really wish we could take
"
,,
5,6,"our relationship to the next level.
"
,,
5,6,"I know, I feel the same way,
"
,,
5,6,"but we made a decision to be abstinent.
"
,,
5,6,"Of course, there are ways
"
,,
5,6,"we could keep our pledge
"
,,
5,6,"and still do other things.
"
,,
5,6,"You're right.
"
,,
5,6,"Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
"
,,
5,6,"Uh-huh.
"
,,
5,6,"Oh, there it is. I see it.
"
,,
5,6,"You know, Roy, I hope you play
"
,,
5,6,"squash better than you pass.
"
,,
5,6,"Well, we'll find out this Saturday.
"
,,
5,6,"All right, Peter,
"
,,
5,6,"you ready for role-playing night?
"
,,
5,6,"Here comes, Grimace.
"
,,
5,6,"You got some burgers I can steal, huh?
"
,,
5,6,"Lois, the Hamburglar steals hamburgers.
"
,,
5,6,"Grimace is
"
,,
5,6,"Ronald McDonald's autistic friend.
"
,,
5,6,"Oh, come on, you love the
"
,,
5,6,"dirty-talking Grimace.
"
,,
5,6,"You... Peter, what the hell is this?
"
,,
5,6," My chastity belt.
"
,,
5,6," A chastity belt?
"
,,
5,6," What in God's name is that for?
"
,,
5,6," I'm abstinent, Lois.
"
,,
5,6,"It's all in these pamphlets
"
,,
5,6,"Meg brought home from school.
"
,,
5,6,"Sex turns straight people gay
"
,,
5,6,"and turn gays into Mexicans.
"
,,
5,6,"Everyone goes down a notch.
"
,,
5,6,"This is nonsense.
"
,,
5,6,"You can't force abstinence on kids.
"
,,
5,6,"Lois, what possible harm
"
,,
5,6,"can abstinence do?
"
,,
5,6,"Meg Griffin, we need to have a talk.
"
,,
5,6,"Mom!
"
,,
5,6,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
5,6,"You kids were doing it...
"
,,
5,6,"in the ear!
"
,,
5,6,"Hey, my sandwich tastes funny. Is there
"
,,
5,6,"something wrong with the Smucker's?
"
,,
5,6,"Yeah, it's been on my crotch.
"
,,
5,6,"Meg, I still cannot believe
"
,,
5,6,"what you and Doug did last night.
"
,,
5,6,"Mom, you don't understand.
"
,,
5,6,"Doug and I are abstinent,
"
,,
5,6,"but if we have sex in the ear,
"
,,
5,6,"it doesn't count.
"
,,
5,6,"We're still pure in the eyes of the Lord.
"
,,
5,6,"Meg, when I was your age,
"
,,
5,6,"my parents tried to feed me
"
,,
5,6,"the same nonsense about premarital sex.
"
,,
5,6,"You're lying to yourself.
"
,,
5,6,"Well, I don't care what you think!
"
,,
5,6,"Doug and I are part of the
"
,,
5,6,"Opal Ring Crusade,
"
,,
5,6,"and this is how we choose
"
,,
5,6,"to express our love.
"
,,
5,6,"Look, Meg,
"
,,
5,6,"A) ear sex is just unnatural,
"
,,
5,6,"and B)...
"
,,
5,6,"How do I say this?
"
,,
5,6,"Vaginal intercourse is...
"
,,
5,6,"it's just tops.
"
,,
5,6,"It's the bee's knees, Meg.
"
,,
5,6,"Oh, when you rattle it around
"
,,
5,6,"just right...
"
,,
5,6,"oh, my God!
"
,,
5,6,"I mean, you remember when we had
"
,,
5,6,"that old car with the bad shocks
"
,,
5,6,"and I used to take the old dirt road
"
,,
5,6,"on purpose?
"
,,
5,6,"Meg... Meg?
"
,,
5,6,"I love you.
"
,,
5,6,"In local news, a sexy new trend
"
,,
5,6,"has emerged at James Woods High.
"
,,
5,6,"That's right, Tom. It appears that
"
,,
5,6,"students have taken to having ear sex
"
,,
5,6,"in lieu of traditional intercourse.
"
,,
5,6,"Over 200 reports of ear sex
"
,,
5,6,"have been confirmed so far,
"
,,
5,6,"prompting a new slogan :
"
,,
5,6,"""Once you go black,""
"
,,
5,6,"""you go deaf.""
"
,,
5,6,"Brian, I'll be right back.
"
,,
5,6,"I'm going to use the little girl's room.
"
,,
5,6,"All right, baby.
"
,,
5,6,"An entire week and still no teeth.
"
,,
5,6,"And it turns out these teeth I got
"
,,
5,6,"from the old man are phony.
"
,,
5,6,"Brian, Brian, look, I'm Gary Busey.
"
,,
5,6,"I'm frequently aggressive
"
,,
5,6,"in situations that don't call for it.
"
,,
5,6," What the hell is that?
"
,,
5,6," Ah, it's Jillian. She's, uh...
"
,,
5,6,"she has this eating disorder.
"
,,
5,6,"She's bulimic.
"
,,
5,6," My God, that's horrible!
"
,,
5,6," I know, it really is.
"
,,
5,6,"I mean, her hair is falling out.
"
,,
5,6,"Last week she lost a tooth.
"
,,
5,6,"Really?
"
,,
5,6,"But man, I'll tell ya, all that purging
"
,,
5,6,"just makes her body look fantastic.
"
,,
5,6,"I mean, that's what the supermodels do.
"
,,
5,6,"And so many of them just look so great.
"
,,
5,6,"Karen Carpenter over did it,
"
,,
5,6,"but I think Jillian's found
"
,,
5,6,"a good balance.
"
,,
5,6,"I'm really surprised
"
,,
5,6,"you invited me out for dinner, Stevie.
"
,,
5,6,"Oh, well, you know, I just wanted
"
,,
5,6,"to touch base, see how everything's...
"
,,
5,6,"It's ""Stewie,"" by the way.
"
,,
5,6,"Just to check in, make sure everything's
"
,,
5,6,"going well with you and Brian.
"
,,
5,6,"It's going kickass!
"
,,
5,6,"Well, you look fantastic.
"
,,
5,6,"Got some meat on your bones,
"
,,
5,6,"which is great.
"
,,
5,6," What?
"
,,
5,6," Just saying you look jolly,
"
,,
5,6,"like Ruben Studdard
"
,,
5,6,"or John Goodman or Santa.
"
,,
5,6,"Oh, my God. Are you saying I'm fat?
"
,,
5,6,"No, I'm saying Santa's thin.
"
,,
5,6,"Get in there and throw up!
"
,,
5,6,"Excellent. Now I'm prepared
"
,,
5,6,"to fight the Tooth Fairy
"
,,
5,6,"just like Gerri fought comedy
"
,,
5,6,"on The Facts of Life.
"
,,
5,6,"Hey, Blair, did you find
"
,,
5,6,"a purse at the mall?
"
,,
5,6,"Actually, I found seven.
"
,,
5,6,"One for every day of the week.
"
,,
5,6,"I'm wide awake, Peter.
"
,,
5,6," You want to mess around?
"
,,
5,6," Lois, you know I'm abstinent.
"
,,
5,6,"Come on. Can't you break
"
,,
5,6,"your stupid pledge for one night?
"
,,
5,6,"Well, I guess we do both have needs.
"
,,
5,6,"Peter.
"
,,
5,6,"Wh-What are you doing? What?
"
,,
5,6,"Peter, what are you doing to my ear?!
"
,,
5,6,"Get off of me!
"
,,
5,6,"What the hell is wrong with you?!
"
,,
5,6,"This is all I can do, Lois.
"
,,
5,6,"I'm abstinent.
"
,,
5,6,"That is it.
"
,,
5,6,"I am going to have regular sex with you
"
,,
5,6,"whether you like it or not.
"
,,
5,6,"No!
"
,,
5,6,"I wasn't asking your permission.
"
,,
5,6,"No, no, no! I'm abstinent!
"
,,
5,6,"This is an affront to the Lord!
"
,,
5,6,"No!
"
,,
5,6,"No!
"
,,
5,6,"No!
"
,,
5,6,"Oh, I see what you're driving at.
"
,,
5,6,"Oh, that was fantastic.
"
,,
5,6,"Hey, when'd you get that tattoo
"
,,
5,6,"on your lower back?
"
,,
5,6,"I don't know, Peter.
"
,,
5,6,"Meth is a hell of a drug.
"
,,
5,6,"What?
"
,,
5,6,"I'm just glad to have you back
"
,,
5,6,"on my side.
"
,,
5,6,"I only wish I could convince Meg
"
,,
5,6,"and her classmates, too.
"
,,
5,6,"We'll show 'em somehow, Lois.
"
,,
5,6,"I'll be more convincing than Mel Gibson
"
,,
5,6,"when he apologized to the Jews.
"
,,
5,6,"I'm really, really sorry about
"
,,
5,6,"your big noses.
"
,,
5,6,"I'm really sorry about how
"
,,
5,6,"greedy you are.
"
,,
5,6,"But most of all, I'm really sorry
"
,,
5,6,"about your dirty,
"
,,
5,6,"underhanded, backstabbing ways.
"
,,
5,6,"Your number-one dirty Jew fan,
"
,,
5,6,"Mel Gibson.
"
,,
5,6,"All right, Tooth Whore, do your worst.
"
,,
5,6,"Stewie, what the hell?
"
,,
5,6,"Get me down from here.
"
,,
5,6,"No, way, man! How do I know
"
,,
5,6,"you're not the Tooth Fairy in disguise?
"
,,
5,6," Your middle name is Gilligan.
"
,,
5,6," Not good enough!
"
,,
5,6," You think my girlfriend's a moron.
"
,,
5,6," So does everyone!
"
,,
5,6,"You have a picture of Chris Noth
"
,,
5,6,"in your wallet.
"
,,
5,6,"Okay.
"
,,
5,6,"Stewie, this is ridiculous.
"
,,
5,6,"There's something I have to tell you.
"
,,
5,6,"The Tooth Fairy isn't real.
"
,,
5,6,"What?!
"
,,
5,6,"Look, I didn't want to burst your
"
,,
5,6,"bubble since you're just a kid, but,
"
,,
5,6,"yeah, she's all smoke and mirrors
"
,,
5,6,"just like Harry Houdini.
"
,,
5,6,"But I don't want to play bridge
"
,,
5,6,"with the Petersons tonight.
"
,,
5,6,"Harry, we agreed weeks ago,
"
,,
5,6,"and we're going.
"
,,
5,6,"All right, fine, let me get my coat.
"
,,
5,6,"Oh, wait a second!
"
,,
5,6,"Damn it! I am not going by myself!
"
,,
5,6,"Ah, you bitch.
"
,,
5,6,"Oh, very well then.
"
,,
5,6,"I suppose that bile-spewing skirt
"
,,
5,6,"of yours can have her tooth back.
"
,,
5,6,"What? It's gone!
"
,,
5,6,"Whoa, I wonder what happened to it?
"
,,
5,6,"Peter, how are we going to get
"
,,
5,6,"past the guard?
"
,,
5,6,"Lois, I think I just got an idea.
"
,,
5,6,"You see that guy with the overcoat?
"
,,
5,6,"He's tall enough for us to
"
,,
5,6,"sneakin behind him. Come on!
"
,,
5,6,"So remember, sex is bad, immoral,
"
,,
5,6,"and wrong.
"
,,
5,6,"And if you have sex,
"
,,
5,6,"you're automatically in Al Qaeda.
"
,,
5,6,"Kids, do not listen to this man.
"
,,
5,6,"He is wrong, he is feeding you lies.
"
,,
5,6,"Now, look, it's true. You shouldn't
"
,,
5,6,"have sex until you're ready.
"
,,
5,6,"You should wait until you're in love.
"
,,
5,6,"But I mean, hey, we're all human, huh?
"
,,
5,6,"We have urges,
"
,,
5,6,"and they are perfectly natural.
"
,,
5,6,"And if you do make the choice
"
,,
5,6,"to act on them,
"
,,
5,6,"make sure you protect yourselves,
"
,,
5,6,"use a condom.
"
,,
5,6," I'm going to use condoms.
"
,,
5,6," Me, too!
"
,,
5,6,"Maybe I'll use two condoms
"
,,
5,6,"at the same time.
"
,,
5,6," Why would you do that?
"
,,
5,6," Oh, I mean, just one, just one.
"
,,
5,6,"Doug, my mom's right.
"
,,
5,6,"If we really care about each other,
"
,,
5,6,"it's okay to have sex.
"
,,
5,6,"We'll be safe. We'll use a condom,
"
,,
5,6,"and it'll be wonderful.
"
,,
5,6,"Wow! Does this mean I'll see you naked?
"
,,
5,6," Yeah.
"
,,
5,6," Oh, boy, I can't wait.
"
,,
5,6," I'm sorry Doug dumped you, honey.
"
,,
5,6," It's all your fault!
"
,,
5,6," I'm proud of you, sweetheart.
"
,,
5,6," Me, too, Lois.
"
,,
5,6,"You stood up for what you believe in.
"
,,
5,6,"I just wish I could have been there
"
,,
5,6,"to hear the speech you made.
"

5,6,"You think you could give me

5,7,"Coming up, a New Orleans man
"

5,7,"says his socks are finally dry.
"
,,
5,7,"But first, the big news
"
,,
5,7,"in entertainment this week
"
,,
5,7,"is the lovable child actress, 
"
,,
5,7,"Olivia Fuller.
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, my God, Brian, that's Olivia
"
,,
5,7,"from the performing arts school.
"
,,
5,7,"What sort of overblown contract
"
,,
5,7,"has that dreadful bitch landed now?
"
,,
5,7,"Most of you know Olivia as the adorable
"
,,
5,7,"little girl in the Tasty Juice ads.
"
,,
5,7,"Hey, Mom, can I have some soda?
"
,,
5,7,"No, but you can have some Tasty Juice.
"
,,
5,7,"It has only one-third the sugar of soda.
"
,,
5,7,"Delicious. Thanks, Mom.
"

5,7,"But little Olivia's career
"

5,7,"may be over just as it begins
"

"

5,7,"that Tasty Juice
"

5,7,"their spokesperson
"

"

5,7,"featuring rock'n'roll legend Chuck Berry.
"

"

5,7,"But there is a silver lining

5,7,"as Miss Fuller will be appearing
"
,,
5,7,"at the Quahog mall this weekend
"
,,
5,7,"to mark the grand opening of the
"
,,
5,7,"new Brat Wraps Kids Clothing store.
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, that's perfect.
"
,,
5,7,"Brian, we have to go down there
"
,,
5,7,"this weekend and heckle her roundly.
"
,,
5,7,"I'll humiliate her worse than
"
,,
5,7,"Luke Skywalker did to that Rebel pilot.
"
,,
5,7,"The exhaust shaft is only
"
,,
5,7,"two meters wide,
"
,,
5,7,"so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.
"
,,
5,7,"That's impossible. Even for a computer.
"
,,
5,7,"It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye
"
,,
5,7,"wamprats in my T-16 back home.
"
,,
5,7,"They're not much bigger than two meters.
"
,,
5,7,"Hey, uh, can-can I talk to
"
,,
5,7,"you privately for a second?
"
,,
5,7,"Sure.
"
,,
5,7,"Th-that, that, uh, that
"
,,
5,7,"was, that was unnecessary.
"
,,
5,7,"What's the problem?
"
,,
5,7,"Well, you just kind of called me
"
,,
5,7,"out in front of everybody back there...
"
,,
5,7," I was just making a point.
"
,,
5,7," I know, I know, but you like just...
"
,,
5,7," kind of sandbagged me.
"
,,
5,7," I sandbagged you?
"
,,
5,7,"In front of all of our friends, yeah,
"
,,
5,7," you sandbagged me.
"
,,
5,7," I sandbagged you.
"
,,
5,7,"You sandbagged me, yes.
"
,,
5,7,"Well, here I am trying
"
,,
5,7,"to help you with something...
"
,,
5,7,"You know what, I don't need
"
,,
5,7,"your kind of help, all right?
"
,,
5,7,"Have a great assault. Jerk.
"
,,
5,7,"Lois, I don't understand why
"
,,
5,7,"I got to sit through a chick flick.
"
,,
5,7,"Peter, you promised you'd come
"
,,
5,7,"with me to see Autumn's Piano.
"
,,
5,7,"Besides, you owe me big after the way
"
,,
5,7,"you embarrassed me in front of Sandra Oh.
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, my God, Sandra Oh.
"
,,
5,7,"We loved you in Sideways.
"
,,
5,7,"Thank you.
"
,,
5,7,"We see you in many movies.
"
,,
5,7,"I think about you while
"
,,
5,7,"having sex with my wife.
"
,,
5,7,"I thank you with one dollar.
"
,,
5,7,"That's a lot of money to them.
"
,,
5,7,"Lois, I'm just warning you,
"
,,
5,7,"if this movie turns me gay, I'm going
"
,,
5,7,"to start bringing gay guys home.
"
,,
5,7,"And I don't mean the classy ""maybe
"
,,
5,7,"they are, maybe they're not"" gay guys.
"
,,
5,7,"I mean those big, ""Oh, my God,""
"
,,
5,7,"""here they come, floatin' around,
"
,,
5,7,"making noise"" gay guys,
"
,,
5,7,"not the ""fix up your house"" gay guys.
"
,,
5,7,"Peter, shh, it's starting.
"
,,
5,7," You must be Autumn Daniels.
"
,,
5,7," Welcome to Barncliffe school for girls.
"
,,
5,7,"We're your roommates : I'm Sassy,
"
,,
5,7,"that's Pouty, and this is Suicidy.
"
,,
5,7,"I got a bad feeling about Suicidy.
"
,,
5,7,"Yeah! You can tell all the girls
"
,,
5,7,"care about each other,
"
,,
5,7,"'cause they have so much
"
,,
5,7,"fun cleaning the dishes.
"
,,
5,7,"and I'm taking my piano with me.</i>
"
,,
5,7,"No...! Why?
"
,,
5,7,"Why? She chose the piano
"
,,
5,7,"over her insulin.
"
,,
5,7,"You could've had both.
"
,,
5,7,"See? That wasn't so bad.
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, you know, Lois, this movie has
"
,,
5,7,"helped me understand a lot of things.
"
,,
5,7,"Like that foreign guy at work
"
,,
5,7,"who helped me understand sarcasm.
"
,,
5,7," Huh, nice day we're having.
"
,,
5,7," Oh, ho-ho! Yes!
"
,,
5,7," What?
"
,,
5,7," He say ""Nice day,""
"
,,
5,7," but he covered with rain.
"
,,
5,7," So?
"
,,
5,7,"So, he say this when your brain
"
,,
5,7,"know is not really nice day.
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, yeah!
"
,,
5,7,"Yes. He say the opposite. He's funny.
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, yeah, I get it. ""Nice day.""
"
,,
5,7,"Now you funny, too. Oh...
"
,,
5,7,"There she is, Brian.
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, boy, I am going to take her
"
,,
5,7,"down right in front of everybody.
"
,,
5,7,"All right, Olivia, get ready to...
"
,,
5,7," Good Lord.
"
,,
5,7," What is it?
"
,,
5,7,"Brian, she looks... she looks fantastic.
"
,,
5,7,"And now TV's Olivia Fuller
"
,,
5,7,"will cut the ceremonial ribbon.
"
,,
5,7,"I hope I'm allowed to do this.
"
,,
5,7,"My mommy says, ""Don't run with scissors.""
"
,,
5,7,"She's so cute.
"
,,
5,7,"I love children. Look at my kids.
"
,,
5,7,"So everyone feel free to browse
"
,,
5,7,"and purchase from our fine selection.
"
,,
5,7,"Hey, Mom, now would be a good
"
,,
5,7,"time to raise my allowance.
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, this one's kind of nice.
"
,,
5,7,"Wha...?
"
,,
5,7,"Olivia! Hey...!
"
,,
5,7,"Stewie? Oh, my God.
"
,,
5,7,"Wow, this is... it's been a while.
"
,,
5,7,"Yeah, no, it has.
"
,,
5,7,"Uh, what, so you back in town?
"
,,
5,7,"Yeah, we're, um,
"
,,
5,7,"we're moving back into the old house.
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, that's... God, you look great,
"
,,
5,7,"I mean, you're all, you're all in shape.
"
,,
5,7,"My God, California's been good to you.
"
,,
5,7,"I mean, I guess, I guess
"
,,
5,7,"you should be looking good
"
,,
5,7,"'cause everybody's a health
"
,,
5,7,"nut out there, right?
"
,,
5,7,"Yeah.
"
,,
5,7,"Well, anyway, it was
"
,,
5,7,"nice seeing you again, so...
"
,,
5,7,"Hey, listen, maybe you want to come over
"
,,
5,7,"on Friday, it's my ""Bernie Mac"" night.
"
,,
5,7,"Um, i-it's a fun show
"
,,
5,7,"if you haven't seen it.
"
,,
5,7,"I can't understand what
"
,,
5,7,"the devil he's saying, but you know,
"
,,
5,7,"there's a lot of movement, and it's bright
"
,,
5,7,"and colorful, it keeps my attention.
"
,,
5,7,"Look, Stewie, you're sweet,
"
,,
5,7,"but since I moved to Hollywood,
"
,,
5,7,"I've done a lot of growing up.
"
,,
5,7,"I'm dating more sophisticated men now.
"
,,
5,7,"But it was good to see you.
"
,,
5,7," What happened?
"
,,
5,7," She shot me down, Brian.
"
,,
5,7,"What do you care? You came here to gloat
"
,,
5,7,"about her contract cancellation anyway.
"
,,
5,7,"Yes, but that was before
"
,,
5,7,"I got a look at her face. I mean,
"
,,
5,7,"she's a woman now, Brian.
"
,,
5,7,"So sophisticated, so grown up,
"
,,
5,7,"and she says she wants a grown-up man.
"
,,
5,7,"But...
"
,,
5,7," apparently, that's not me.
"
,,
5,7," Ya think so?

,,
5,7,"Who could forget that one?

"
,,
5,7,"She says she wants a more
"
,,
5,7,"mature, grown-up man,
"
,,
5,7,"so all I've got to do is be more grown-up.
"
,,
5,7," What are you doing?

"
,,
5,7,"Oh, dear God.

"
,,
5,7,"kickin' it tonight.
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, look at that.
"
,,
5,7,"I'm growing all the time.
"
,,
5,7,"Hey, uh, Jillian,
"
,,
5,7,"can you give me a minute?
"
,,
5,7,"You ever just let your balls
"
,,
5,7,"hang out, B-Ri?
"
,,
5,7,"You ever do that, B-Roney?
"
,,
5,7,"Drove my Chevy to the levee,
"
,,
5,7,"but the levee was Bri?
"
,,
5,7," Give me my hair back.
"
,,
5,7," Ow! What the hell, man.
"
,,
5,7,"Stewie, this is not going
"
,,
5,7,"to convince Olivia
"
,,
5,7,"that you're grown-up enough for her.
"
,,
5,7," Yeah, what do you know about women?
"
,,
5,7," You want to know how to get women?
"
,,
5,7,"There's only one place
"
,,
5,7,"in town you need to observe.
"
,,
5,7,"Just watch.
"
,,
5,7,"I am not doing that, Glenn.
"
,,
5,7,"Come on, beautiful, keep an open mind.
"
,,
5,7," You're a sick man.
"
,,
5,7," Hey, keep it down.
"
,,
5,7,"I don't want my neighbors seeing
"
,,
5,7,"a fat, old, dirty whore
"
,,
5,7,"screaming at me on my front lawn.
"
,,
5,7,"Whore?
"
,,
5,7," Well, maybe I should come inside.
"
,,
5,7," Well, maybe you should.
"
,,
5,7,"What the deuce?
"
,,
5,7,"Why the hell would she respond
"
,,
5,7,"positively to such a negative comment?
"
,,
5,7,"Unless...
"
,,
5,7,"Brian, do women like it
"
,,
5,7,"when you treat them like crap?
"
,,
5,7,"Well, I don't know if you want
"
,,
5,7,"to be that black and white about it.
"
,,
5,7,"That's it, isn't it? Women respond
"
,,
5,7,"when you treat them like crap.
"
,,
5,7,"Well, Olivia, prepare to meet
"
,,
5,7,"a much darker Stewie Griffin.
"
,,
5,7,"Hey, babe. What do you say,
"
,,
5,7,"we going out Saturday night?
"
,,
5,7,"Stewie, what are you doing here?
"
,,
5,7,"I told you, I'm just into a
"
,,
5,7,"different type of guy.
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, yeah? I'll tell you what
"
,,
5,7,"you're into. Being ugly.
"
,,
5,7,"Stewie, you're being mean.
"
,,
5,7,"No. If I was being mean, when you
"
,,
5,7,"opened the door I would have said,
"
,,
5,7,"""Oh, hey, Ray Liotta, is Olivia home?
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, wait, you're Olivia.""
"
,,
5,7,"You see, I thought you were
"
,,
5,7,"Ray Liotta because your skin
"
,,
5,7,"has the texture of a decorative
"
,,
5,7,"autumn squash.
"
,,
5,7,"So, I'll pick you up at 7:00?
"
,,
5,7,"That sounds wonderful.
"
,,
5,7,"She said yes.
"
,,
5,7,"My God, I'm cooler than that
"
,,
5,7,"cheetah from the commercials.
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, God, there is no (bleeping)
"
,,
5,7,"drummer better than Neil Peart!
"
,,
5,7,"It ain't easy bein' cheesy.
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, Smilla, your sense of snow
"
,,
5,7,"is equaled only by your sense of love.
"
,,
5,7,"Peter, have you been up all night
"
,,
5,7,"watching chick movies?
"
,,
5,7,"Lois, before I found these movies,
"
,,
5,7,"women only made me cry through my penis.
"
,,
5,7,"Now they make me cry through my eyes.
"
,,
5,7,"I've decided.
"
,,
5,7,"I'm making my own chick flick.
"
,,
5,7,"What? You don't know anything
"
,,
5,7,"about making movies.
"
,,
5,7,"Are you kidding? I got lots of
"
,,
5,7,"experience in the film industry.
"
,,
5,7,"I was the original ""Pretty Woman.""
"
,,
5,7,"You look beautiful,
"
,,
5,7,"but there's something missing.
"
,,
5,7,"This is a beautiful spot, Stewie.
"
,,
5,7,"I know. I love coming here because you
"
,,
5,7,"can just sit here and people-watch,
"
,,
5,7,"you know?
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, oh, look at this. Look at this guy.
"
,,
5,7,"Look at this. What is that?
"
,,
5,7,"What is he doing?
"
,,
5,7,"Just standing there smelling his hand?
"
,,
5,7,"""What is that? What is that on my hand?""
"
,,
5,7,"""Is that... is that barbecue sauce?
"
,,
5,7,"When was I near barbecue sauce?""
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, look, look!
"
,,
5,7,"Jewish cowboy! Jewish cowboy!
"
,,
5,7,"Yeah. Not gonna be so tough
"
,,
5,7,"when the sun goes down, are you?
"
,,
5,7,"Better go rassle up some
"
,,
5,7,"Chinese food, Hopalong Nussbaum.
"
,,
5,7,"You know, Stewie, I'm really glad
"
,,
5,7,"I gave you another chance.
"
,,
5,7,"You're a really special guy.
"
,,
5,7,"I know.
"
,,
5,7,"No, no, I'm kidding. I'm not really that
"
,,
5,7,"self-centered, but, you know, Olivia,
"
,,
5,7,"I can't think of anyplace I'd rather be
"
,,
5,7,"than right here right now with you.
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, look at this guy. Now,
"
,,
5,7,"there's someone who cuts his own hair.
"
,,
5,7,"Yeah, no kidding. Oh, my God.
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, oh, oh, oh, check out this
"
,,
5,7,"uptight Asian guy, look at that.
"
,,
5,7,"I work really hard, 'cause I'm no fun.
"
,,
5,7,"Boy, this is a great city.
"
,,
5,7,"I don't care what anybody says.
"
,,
5,7,"I know.
"
,,
5,7,"Look at that sunset against the skyline.
"
,,
5,7," I know. Wow, look at that.
"
,,
5,7," A perfect end to a perfect day.
"
,,
5,7,"Yeah. Well, we should probably get home.
"
,,
5,7,"This area gets really dangerous at night.
"
,,
5,7,"Okay, everyone, welcome to the first
"
,,
5,7,"day of shooting for Steel Vaginas.
"
,,
5,7,"Peter, this movie doesn't seem
"
,,
5,7,"to make any sense.
"
,,
5,7,"It makes perfect sense, Lois. This the
"
,,
5,7,"scene where our heroine, Vageena Hertz,
"
,,
5,7,"is told by Dr. McNugget here
"
,,
5,7,"that she has uncurable chick cancer.
"
,,
5,7,"All right, Joe, let's lose
"
,,
5,7,"the wheelchair and shoot this thing.
"
,,
5,7,"Peter, I can't lose the wheelchair.
"
,,
5,7,"I need it to move.
"
,,
5,7,"Okay, yeah, but your character can walk.
"
,,
5,7,"Peter, I'm handicapped.
"
,,
5,7,"I can't walk.
"
,,
5,7,"Okay, Chris, roll film.
"
,,
5,7,"And... action!
"
,,
5,7,"Joe, get out of the damn chair.
"
,,
5,7,"Chris, get the cattle prod.
"
,,
5,7,"Okay, now give him some peanut butter
"
,,
5,7,"so we can make it look like he's talking.
"
,,
5,7,"God, I hate these things.
"
,,
5,7,"Sweetie, can't you just have a good time?
"
,,
5,7,"I don't know anybody.
"
,,
5,7,"These are all your friends.
"
,,
5,7,"Just relax. Have some cake or something.
"
,,
5,7,"Hey, hey, who do we have here?
"
,,
5,7," Oh, my God! Victor?
"
,,
5,7," Hey, kiddo, how are you?
"
,,
5,7,"Great! Great! Wow!
"
,,
5,7,"Stewie, this is Victor. We did a
"
,,
5,7,"Flintstones vitamins commercial together.
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, yeah, good to meet you.
"
,,
5,7,"How are you?
"
,,
5,7,"Victor's such a good actor.
"
,,
5,7,"He played a dead baby on CSI: Miami.
"
,,
5,7,"Yeah, I'm more into writing now.
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, hang on a sec.
"
,,
5,7,"Uh, idea for a short story :
"
,,
5,7,"guy picks his nose, then eats it.
"
,,
5,7,"Yeah, good luck with that. Hey, Olivia,
"
,,
5,7,"why don't you and I go get some punch?
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, actually, would you mind getting
"
,,
5,7,"some for Victor and me while we catch up?
"
,,
5,7,"Or-or a third option.
"
,,
5,7,"Why doesn't Victor go get some
"
,,
5,7,"punch for you and me?
"
,,
5,7,"Or maybe you and I could go away
"
,,
5,7,"from Victor and go get the punch?
"
,,
5,7,"Or-or none of us could have punch.
"
,,
5,7,"But still Victor could go away.
"
,,
5,7,"Victor, would you excuse us for a second?
"
,,
5,7,"Uh, sure.
"
,,
5,7,"Idea for a novel :
"
,,
5,7,"guy loses his favorite blankie, goes
"
,,
5,7,"looking for it and finds it in the kitchen.
"
,,
5,7,"Is that... I amaze myself.
"
,,
5,7,"Is that... It's genius.
"
,,
5,7,"It's unbelievable.
"
,,
5,7,"I don't know where I get it from.
"
,,
5,7,"What the hell is wrong with you?
"
,,
5,7,"You're acting like a jerk.
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, I'm acting like a jerk?
"
,,
5,7,"What about Phony Curtis over there?
"
,,
5,7,"He happens to be a very intelligent,
"
,,
5,7,"successful actor.
"
,,
5,7,"And, you know, he's done
"
,,
5,7,"three national diaper commercials.
"
,,
5,7,"Yeah, let's put a diaper on his face.
"
,,
5,7,"That's where the crap is coming out.
"
,,
5,7,"You don't own me.
"
,,
5,7,"I can talk to whoever I want.
"
,,
5,7,"I don't see a ring on my finger.
"
,,
5,7,"I, Stewie, take you, Olivia,
"
,,
5,7,"to be my lawfully wedded wife.
"
,,
5,7,"Uh, what's that, Rupert?
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, oh, kiss the bride. Yes.
"
,,
5,7," Hi, honey! I'm home!
"
,,
5,7," Hi, sweetie, how was your day?
"
,,
5,7,"Well, I was an astronaut
"
,,
5,7,"for a while, then I was a cowboy,
"
,,
5,7,"and then all afternoon I was a fireman,
"
,,
5,7,"so it's been, uh... it's been a long one.
"
,,
5,7," Uh, what's for dinner?
"
,,
5,7," Playdoh spaghetti.
"
,,
5,7," Oh.
"
,,
5,7," What?
"
,,
5,7,"No. No, it's nothing.
"
,,
5,7,"Just had Playdoh spaghetti last night.
"
,,
5,7," And that's all we had last night.
"
,,
5,7," What does that mean?
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, I don't know, Olivia.
"
,,
5,7,"Maybe that we are in a sexless marriage.
"
,,
5,7,"We have yet to have sex.
"
,,
5,7,"Do you even know what sex is?
"
,,
5,7,"That's not the poi... Don't change the...
"
,,
5,7,"It's a kind of cake?
"
,,
5,7,"Look, can we just drop this
"
,,
5,7,"and have a normal pretend dinner?
"
,,
5,7,"Fine, fine!
"
,,
5,7,"Uch, some days I think it was easier
"
,,
5,7,"being Q-Bert's roommate.
"
,,
5,7,"God, it's all night with this guy.
"
,,
5,7,"If you're gonna leave all those lights on,
"
,,
5,7,"I'm not gonna split the electric bill.
"
,,
5,7,"Sorry we're late, everyone, but JonBenet
"
,,
5,7,"here took forever with her makeup.
"
,,
5,7,"Uh, yes, and we probably would've
"
,,
5,7,"shaved a few minutes off our trip,
"
,,
5,7,"but Mr. Cheapo here refused
"
,,
5,7,"to let the valet touch his Big Wheel,
"
,,
5,7,"so we had to drive around the block
"
,,
5,7,"six times till we could find a spot.
"
,,
5,7,"But to his credit, it is a great spot
"
,,
5,7,"to get mugged.
"
,,
5,7,"Wouldn't that be a shame, if they took
"
,,
5,7,"all my money out of both our wallets.
"
,,
5,7,"Well, it's just good to have
"
,,
5,7,"you guys here.
"
,,
5,7,"Can I get you folks something to drink?
"
,,
5,7," Uh, yes, I'll just have flat water.
"
,,
5,7," Um, do you have Hi-C Tropical Punch?
"
,,
5,7,"And it begins...
"
,,
5,7,"What? I can't have a drink with dinner?
"
,,
5,7,"So dinner started at 2:00
"
,,
5,7,"this afternoon, did it?
"
,,
5,7,"Yes, about the same time you
"
,,
5,7,"decided to hole up in the bathroom
"
,,
5,7," for three hours waxing your eyebrows.
"
,,
5,7," You swore you would never...
"
,,
5,7,"I have a prominent brow,
"
,,
5,7,"and I do what I can to get by.
"
,,
5,7,"Well, hey, what's important
"
,,
5,7,"is that you're here now.
"
,,
5,7," Let's just enjoy dinner.
"
,,
5,7," Yeah, can't we just have a good time?
"
,,
5,7,"Ask Olivia.
"
,,
5,7,"Olivia, the three of us are having
"
,,
5,7,"a great time. What's your problem?
"
,,
5,7,"My problem is you.
"
,,
5,7,"You're acting like a baby.
"
,,
5,7,"And we come to the center of
"
,,
5,7,"the shrubbery maze.
"
,,
5,7,"That's what it all comes down to, isn't it?
"
,,
5,7,"I'm not grown up enough for you.
"
,,
5,7," Well, you are a baby, aren't you?
"
,,
5,7," Stay out of it. Stay out of it.
"
,,
5,7,"Well, if you think I'm a baby,
"
,,
5,7,"then perhaps I should act like a baby.
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, oh, oh, what's that?
"
,,
5,7,"What's that, sir? What's that?
"
,,
5,7,"I'm sorry, am I being too loud for you?
"
,,
5,7,"You wanna come over here
"
,,
5,7,"and quiet me down?
"
,,
5,7," Oh, let's do this.
"
,,
5,7," Oh, God. Stewie, come on.
"
,,
5,7," I'm scared.
"
,,
5,7," No, it's okay. It's okay.
"
,,
5,7,"Sir? You feel strong?
"
,,
5,7,"You wanna come over here?
"
,,
5,7,"and have my steak.</i>
"
,,
5,7," Oh, yeah?
"
,,
5,7," What is that, the porterhouse?
"
,,
5,7," How is it?
"
,,
5,7,"If we weren't fighting,
"
,,
5,7,"would you recommend it?
"
,,
5,7,"Well, I know what I'm getting.
"
,,
5,7,"Hello, everyone.
"
,,
5,7,"Well, here we are... opening night.
"
,,
5,7,"You know, somebody once told me
"
,,
5,7,"that making movies was easy.
"
,,
5,7,"Yeah. Yeah, you know what else is easy?
"
,,
5,7,"Open heart surgery.
"
,,
5,7," Yeah, thanks for coming, Fuad.
"
,,
5,7,"heart surgery not easy at all.</i>
"
,,
5,7,"Yeah, yeah. Calm down, Fuad.
"
,,
5,7,"So, without further dudes, ah,
"
,,
5,7,"let's, uh, watch this thing.
"
,,
5,7,"in women and unicorns,</i>
"
,,
5,7,"about the power of chick stuff,</i>
"
,,
5,7,"Sorry.
"
,,
5,7,"I had a small heart and a lot to learn.</i>
"
,,
5,7,"Push, honey!
"
,,
5,7,"Hurry up and give me my baby boy!
"
,,
5,7,"Cleveland, more SpaghettiO's.
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, good, a baby. Oh, no, it's a girl.
"
,,
5,7,"And I hate girls.
"
,,
5,7,"too soon after eating a sandwich...</i>
"
,,
5,7,"Help! Help! I'm drowning!
"
,,
5,7,"Help!
"
,,
5,7,"We gotta get this woman to surgery time.
"
,,
5,7,"Right stat now!
"
,,
5,7,"And she died from an angry hymen.</i>
"
,,
5,7,"Wow, that was the worst piece
"
,,
5,7,"of crap I ever seen.
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, my God, that was an abomination.
"
,,
5,7," That was awful. Awful. Awful, awful.
"
,,
5,7," My ass is actually sore.
"
,,
5,7,"My ass is actually sore.
"
,,
5,7," Hey, where's Olivia?
"
,,
5,7," Oh, she's probably up at the house.
"
,,
5,7," Stewie?
"
,,
5,7," Yeah?
"
,,
5,7," It's not your fault.
"
,,
5,7," What?
"
,,
5,7," It's not your fault.
"
,,
5,7," I know.
"
,,
5,7," It's not your fault.
"
,,
5,7," I know.
"
,,
5,7,"No, Stewie, Stewie. It's not your fault.
"
,,
5,7,"Don't do this to me, man. Not you, man.
"
,,
5,7," It's not your fault.
"
,,
5,7," Screw you! Cut it out, man.
"
,,
5,7," It's not your fault.
"
,,
5,7," Why is it so hard?
"
,,
5,7,"I didn't know it was gonna be so hard.
"
,,
5,7,"Look, Stewie, you stood up
"
,,
5,7,"before God and all your toys
"
,,
5,7,"and you took an oath to stick it out
"
,,
5,7,"when things got tough.
"
,,
5,7,"You want her to see you as an adult?
"
,,
5,7,"Well, this is adulthood.
"
,,
5,7,"You're right, Brian.
"
,,
5,7,"I can't hide from this relationship.
"
,,
5,7,"It's my responsability to deal with it.
"
,,
5,7,"I mean, what kind of a man
"
,,
5,7,"would I be If I ran off now?
"
,,
5,7,"Well, you'd be a black man.
"
,,
5,7," Whoa, what was that?
"
,,
5,7," I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
"
,,
5,7,"That was my father talking.
"
,,
5,7,"You, uh...
"
,,
5,7,"you gotta work on that, man.
"
,,
5,7,"Bad dog.
"
,,
5,7,"Sweetie, listen, I'm sorry, I...
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, Stewie! I thought you were
"
,,
5,7,"at Chuck E. Cheese's with your mom.
"
,,
5,7,"No. A four-year-old died in the ball pit.
"
,,
5,7,"We had to cancel.
"
,,
5,7,"Is that the Silly Putty
"
,,
5,7,"I bought you this weekend?
"
,,
5,7,"Stewie, this isn't what it looks like.
"
,,
5,7,"Uh-uh, yeah, Stewie,
"
,,
5,7,"I just dropped by to...
"
,,
5,7,"Uh, uh, uh, ain't nobody talking to you.
"
,,
5,7,"Is... that... the Silly Putty...
"
,,
5,7,"I bought you...
"
,,
5,7,"this weekend?
"
,,
5,7,"You know, I'm really sensing something here...
"
,,
5,7,"I should be go.
"
,,
5,7,"No, about you stay here and I leave
"
,,
5,7,"and never come back again?
"
,,
5,7,"Stewie, this isn't how I wanted
"
,,
5,7,"it to end.
"
,,
5,7,"But you did want it to end.
"
,,
5,7,"You've made that perfectly clear.
"
,,
5,7," Listen, are you gonna be all right?
"
,,
5,7," Yeah, I'll be fine.
"
,,
5,7,"Is that smoke?
"
,,
5,7,"Idea for a farce : cheating wife
"
,,
5,7,"and pompous ass burned alive.
"
,,
5,7,"So what happened?
"
,,
5,7,"Well, you wanna know what I learned
"
,,
5,7,"this week? Being a grown-up sucks.
"
,,
5,7,"Women, Brian. What a royal
"
,,
5,7,"pain in the ass. It's like, it's like,
"
,,
5,7,"why can't you just hang out
"
,,
5,7,"with guys, you know?
"
,,
5,7,"Just live with someone of your own sex.
"
,,
5,7,"Just do what you would do with women,
"
,,
5,7,"but with your buddy, you know,
"
,,
5,7,"why don't guys just do that?
"
,,
5,7,"They do, it's called being gay.
"
,,
5,7,"Oh, that's what gay is?
"
,,
5,7,"Yeah, I could totally get into that.

5,8,"The only way they're not going to kill
"
,,
5,8,"my sister is if we give them the stone.
"
,,
5,8,"Well, they're going to be
"
,,
5,8,"looking everywhere.
"
,,
5,8,"We'll have to hide it in my chin.
"
,,
5,8,"Uh-oh, here they come.
"
,,
5,8,"You'd better get in there, too.
"
,,
5,8,"Good God,
"
,,
5,8,"Joan Wilder's sister is being
"
,,
5,8,"held hostage in Cartagena,
"
,,
5,8,"and there's not a policeman in sight.
"
,,
5,8,"I guess it's up to me.
"
,,
5,8," Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.
"
,,
5,8," And I'm Diane Simmons.
"
,,
5,8,"Our top story : Mayor West has dispatched
"
,,
5,8,"the entire Quahog police force
"
,,
5,8,"to Cartagena, Columbia, to assist in the
"
,,
5,8,"rescue of fictional 1984 movie character,
"
,,
5,8,"Elaine Wilder. More on that later.
"
,,
5,8,"Now let's go to
"
,,
5,8,"Ollie Williams' Cooking Corner.
"
,,
5,8," What are you making, Ollie?
"
,,
5,8," Eggo!
"
,,
5,8,"Thanks, Ollie. And now this.
"
,,
5,8,"Lois, can you come out here for a second?
"
,,
5,8,"Lois, can you run inside
"
,,
5,8,"and get me some oranges
"
,,
5,8,"or whatever it is these things eat?
"
,,
5,8,"Peter, what is that?
"
,,
5,8,"This would be a giraffe, Issac Newton.
"
,,
5,8,"I stole it from the zoo.
"
,,
5,8,"What with Mayor West sending
"
,,
5,8,"all the cops away,
"
,,
5,8,"everybody can do whatever they want.
"
,,
5,8,"Peter, I don't care what
"
,,
5,8,"Mayor West has done.
"
,,
5,8,"You can't just break the law.
"
,,
5,8,"Sure, I can.
"
,,
5,8,"I've been doing it all week.
"
,,
5,8,"Like yesterday, I started a lovable
"
,,
5,8,"gang of cockney pickpockets.
"
,,
5,8,"All right, boys,
"
,,
5,8,"the best targets are old, rich people.
"
,,
5,8,"There's one now. Go get him.
"
,,
5,8,"Oh, no, there's no police here
"
,,
5,8,"to help me!
"
,,
5,8,"I hope you don't find the money
"
,,
5,8,"strapped to my thigh.
"
,,
5,8,"Peter, you take that thing back
"
,,
5,8,"where it belongs immediately.
"
,,
5,8,"All right, I guess we gotta go
"
,,
5,8,"back to the zoo, Allison Janney.
"
,,
5,8,"Allison Janney?
"
,,
5,8,"That feels really good.</i>
"
,,
5,8,"What the hell?!</i>
"
,,
5,8,"from last night. Get out of here.</i>
"
,,
5,8,"What the hell?
"
,,
5,8,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
"
,,
5,8,"I gotta stop taking my baths
"
,,
5,8,"during Peter's shenanigans.
"
,,
5,8,"Hello.
"
,,
5,8,"Oh, hey, Jillian. What's up?
"
,,
5,8,"Brian, are you coming over
"
,,
5,8,"to watch Laguna Beach tonight?
"
,,
5,8,"Uh, what time does it start?
"
,,
5,8,"What?
"
,,
5,8,"What did you say? Specific time?
"
,,
5,8," Don't you mean Pacific Time?
"
,,
5,8," No.
"
,,
5,8,"I think it's called Specific time.
"
,,
5,8,"They mean it starts specifically at 10:00.
"
,,
5,8,"Stewie, are you on the line?
"
,,
5,8," Yes.
"
,,
5,8," Jillian, I'll talk to you later.
"
,,
5,8,"Uh... so... Meg.
"
,,
5,8,"How was school?
"
,,
5,8,"Horrible.
"
,,
5,8,"There's a dance Friday night
"
,,
5,8,"and no one wants to go with me.
"
,,
5,8,"Even my backup guy had plans.
"
,,
5,8,"Hi, Jimmy.
"
,,
5,8,"Um, I heard you didn't
"
,,
5,8,"have a date to the dance,
"
,,
5,8,"and I was wondering if
"
,,
5,8,"you'd like to go with me.
"
,,
5,8,"Oh, uh, I, uh...
"
,,
5,8,"H-Hang on.
"
,,
5,8,"I'd love to go, Meg, but...
"
,,
5,8,"I have to go to my little
"
,,
5,8,"brother's funeral that night.
"
,,
5,8,"Aw, I'm sure you'll find someone
"
,,
5,8,"to go with you.
"
,,
5,8,"No, I won't.
"
,,
5,8,"I'm so fat and gross.
"
,,
5,8,"I should just kill myself.
"
,,
5,8,"That's...
"
,,
5,8," Come on.
"
,,
5,8," I'm gonna do it.
"
,,
5,8,"I'm gonna kill myself 'cause
"
,,
5,8,"no one will go with me.
"
,,
5,8,"Meg, stop it.
"
,,
5,8,"Come on.
"
,,
5,8,"All right, all right, Meg,
"
,,
5,8,"look, what if I...
"
,,
5,8,"what if I drove you and
"
,,
5,8,"walked in with you
"
,,
5,8," or whatever?
"
,,
5,8," Brian, will you go with me?!
"
,,
5,8," Are you going to kill yourself if I don't?
"
,,
5,8," Yeah.
"
,,
5,8,"Well, then my hands are pretty much tied.
"
,,
5,8,"Oh, Brian, thank you,
"
,,
5,8,"thank you, thank you.
"
,,
5,8,"I have to buy a new dress.
"
,,
5,8,"All the ones I have make me look fat.
"
,,
5,8,"The story on everyone's mind
"
,,
5,8,"continues to be the absence
"
,,
5,8,"of police officers in Quahog.
"
,,
5,8,"Sir, as a citizen,
"
,,
5,8,"how has this affected you?
"
,,
5,8,"The police are gone?
"
,,
5,8,"Oh, my God, we're finally safe!
"
,,
5,8,"our hearts singing so joyfully</i>
"
,,
5,8,"to yourself to check it out</i>
"
,,
5,8,"Hey, Joe, where you been?
"
,,
5,8,"We haven't seen you in days.
"
,,
5,8,"Ever since Mayor West
"
,,
5,8,"deployed the police to Cartagena,
"
,,
5,8,"I've been working nonstop.
"
,,
5,8,"The only reason I didn't have
"
,,
5,8,"to go myself
"
,,
5,8,"is that South America isn't
"
,,
5,8,"wheelchair accessible.
"
,,
5,8,"Hey, you guys, we should help Joe out.
"
,,
5,8,"We could be cops, right, Joe?
"
,,
5,8,"Well, we have started an emergency
"
,,
5,8,"training program at the Police Academy,
"
,,
5,8,"but I'm not sure that you're cut out
"
,,
5,8,"for the job.
"
,,
5,8,"Come on, we'll be great cops.
"
,,
5,8,"Besides, it's bound to go better than
"
,,
5,8,"my deep-sea training.
"
,,
5,8,"Well, we've got long time
"
,,
5,8,"in this decompression chamber.
"
,,
5,8,"You guys mind if I turn on the radio?
"
,,
5,8,"Peter, don't!
"
,,
5,8," Oh, nice going, jackass.
"
,,
5,8," Look what you did.
"
,,
5,8,"Excuse the hell out of me for trying to
"
,,
5,8,"brighten your day with music, all right?
"
,,
5,8," You idiot, use your brain.
"
,,
5,8," You're an idiot.
"
,,
5,8,"Stop, stop, stop.
"
,,
5,8,"Oh, man, we're going to need
"
,,
5,8,"some butter or something.
"
,,
5,8,"Oh, Brian, it is so nice of you
"
,,
5,8,"to take Meg to this dance.
"
,,
5,8," It really mean sa lot to her.
"
,,
5,8," You got any weed?
"
,,
5,8,"I put it in your coat pocket.
"
,,
5,8,"Here she is. Brian, I present to you
"
,,
5,8,"your polished turd for the evening.
"
,,
5,8,"How do I look, Brian?
"
,,
5,8,"You sure do, Meg.
"
,,
5,8,"FYI, the carpet matches the drapes
"
,,
5,8,"in color and length.
"
,,
5,8,"Well, Brian, here we go.
"
,,
5,8,"Oh, this is going to be so much fun.
"
,,
5,8,"God, this is going to be a long night.
"
,,
5,8,"Oh, Brian, let's dance.
"
,,
5,8,"This song kicks ass.
"
,,
5,8,"Man, I got to tell ya,
"
,,
5,8,"I can see why you'd be insecure, Meg.
"
,,
5,8,"Some of these chicks are unbelievable.
"
,,
5,8,"Brian, can I ask you something?
"
,,
5,8,"Are you drinking so much
"
,,
5,8,"because you don't want to be here?
"
,,
5,8,"No, no, Meg. It's-that's...
"
,,
5,8,"My...
"
,,
5,8,"God, look at these chicks.
"
,,
5,8,"You know, the best thing
"
,,
5,8,"about these girls is,
"
,,
5,8,"even if you're terrible,
"
,,
5,8,"they don't know the difference.
"
,,
5,8,"You know, Meg,
"
,,
5,8,"there's no dogs allowed here,
"
,,
5,8,"so you're going to have to leave.
"
,,
5,8,"But Brian can stay.
"
,,
5,8,"You know, Connie, I think I have a
"
,,
5,8,"theory about why you're such a bitch.
"
,,
5,8," Excuse me?
"
,,
5,8," Brian, let's just go.
"
,,
5,8,"No, no, no, no. Now hang on...
"
,,
5,8,"hang on, Meg, hang on.
"
,,
5,8,"You see, Connie,
"
,,
5,8,"you're popular because
"
,,
5,8,"you developed early
"
,,
5,8,"and started putting out when you were 12.
"
,,
5,8,"But now you can't stand
"
,,
5,8,"to look at yourself in the mirror
"
,,
5,8,"because all you see is a whore.
"
,,
5,8,"So, you pick on Meg to avoid
"
,,
5,8,"the inevitable realization
"
,,
5,8,"that once your body's used up by age 19,
"
,,
5,8,"you're going to be a worn-out,
"
,,
5,8,"chalky-skinned burlap sack
"
,,
5,8,"that even your step dad won't want.
"
,,
5,8,"How's that? Am I in the ballpark?
"
,,
5,8,"Brian, that was amazing.
"
,,
5,8,"No one's ever stood up for me like that.
"
,,
5,8,"Hey, no problem.
"
,,
5,8,"She's a... she's a skank.
"
,,
5,8,"You know, you don't deserve all
"
,,
5,8,"the crap you get, Meg, you know that?
"
,,
5,8,"Thanks, Brian.
"
,,
5,8,"Sorry, that was the booze, not you.
"
,,
5,8,"You gonna eat that?
"
,,
5,8,"Oh, yes, the day can begin.
"
,,
5,8,"Good morning, Brian.
"
,,
5,8,"Now we can do this one of two ways.
"
,,
5,8,"I can bust your balls to pieces right now,
"
,,
5,8,"or we can spread it out
"
,,
5,8,"over the course of the day.
"
,,
5,8," I don't want to talk about it.
"
,,
5,8," Well, I do.
"
,,
5,8,"So tell me everything
"
,,
5,8,"that happened at the dance.
"
,,
5,8," Morning, cutie.
"
,,
5,8," Uh, hey.
"
,,
5,8,"I had so much fun last night, Brian.
"
,,
5,8,"I thought maybe we could go
"
,,
5,8,"get some coffee later.
"
,,
5,8,"I-I don't think so.
"
,,
5,8,"Oh, come on, who's a good boy?
"
,,
5,8,"Who's a good boy, huh?
"
,,
5,8,"Who's a good boy?
"
,,
5,8,"Me.
"
,,
5,8," Oh, yes, yes, yes, who's a good boy?
"
,,
5,8," I am. I'm a good boy.
"
,,
5,8,"But... no, no, no, look, look...
"
,,
5,8,"I got stuff to do today.
"
,,
5,8," All right? Sorry.
"
,,
5,8," We should hook up anyway.
"
,,
5,8,"I'll bug you later.
"
,,
5,8,"Well, she seems to have taken
"
,,
5,8,"a shine to you, Brian.
"
,,
5,8,"With a little encouragement, you might get
"
,,
5,8,"her to put her cankles behind her ears.
"
,,
5,8,"Stewie, shut up.
"
,,
5,8,"Who the hell is texting me at 8:00 a.m.?
"
,,
5,8,"Wait a minute.
"
,,
5,8,"Something did happen last night.
"
,,
5,8,"Look, it's not that big a deal,
"
,,
5,8,"all right? We just... we just...
"
,,
5,8,"made out a little.
"
,,
5,8,"Tell me about it! Go.
"
,,
5,8,"It didn't mean anything.
"
,,
5,8,"I had a few too many and...
"
,,
5,8,"it's not even worth going into.
"
,,
5,8,"This is even a bigger jackpot
"
,,
5,8,"than when the Emperor figured out
"
,,
5,8,"the formula
"
,,
5,8,"for great Star Wars dialogue.
"
,,
5,8,"Something, something, something...
"
,,
5,8,"dark side.
"
,,
5,8,"Something, something, something...
"
,,
5,8,"complete.
"
,,
5,8,"Well, this is it.
"
,,
5,8,"Our first day of Police Academy IV.
"
,,
5,8,"Welcome to the Police Academy.
"
,,
5,8,"We're going to start by learning
"
,,
5,8,"how to do a cavity search.
"
,,
5,8,"Peter, you will be the police officer
"
,,
5,8,"and Quagmire,
"
,,
5,8,"you will be the suspect.
"
,,
5,8,"Begin.
"
,,
5,8,"Sir, I suspect you are
"
,,
5,8,"in possession of drugs,
"
,,
5,8,"and I'm going to have to give you
"
,,
5,8,"a full cavity search. Drop your pants.
"
,,
5,8,"Uh, Peter, you don't have
"
,,
5,8,"to pull your pants down.
"
,,
5,8," Oh, sorry. I'm still learning.
"
,,
5,8," All right, start the search.
"
,,
5,8,"I think that's everything.
"
,,
5,8,"You want me to double-check?
"
,,
5,8,"Hi, honey.
"
,,
5,8,"What?
"
,,
5,8,"I was thinking about our kiss last night.
"
,,
5,8,"I never knew how flat and wide
"
,,
5,8,"your tongue was.
"
,,
5,8,"Yeah...
"
,,
5,8,"You know, I thought about
"
,,
5,8,"how you stood up for me at the dance,
"
,,
5,8,"and all the nice things you said.
"
,,
5,8,"We should totally be
"
,,
5,8,"boyfriend and girlfriend.
"
,,
5,8,"Well, Meg, uh, you know what's strange?
"
,,
5,8,"I-I-I think I might be gay.
"
,,
5,8,"I saw this penis on the Internet today
"
,,
5,8,"and I thought to myself :
"
,,
5,8,"""Well, that's...""
"
,,
5,8," ""that's just fine.""
"
,,
5,8," I'm going to the mall later.
"
,,
5,8,"Maybe you can come and help me
"
,,
5,8,"pick out some underwear.
"
,,
5,8,"I don't think that's gonna
"
,,
5,8,"be a possibility. I have...
"
,,
5,8,"plans, um...
"
,,
5,8,"with Chris.
"
,,
5,8,"Chris and I have plans this afternoon.
"
,,
5,8," We do?
"
,,
5,8," Yeah, we're doing that thing.
"
,,
5,8,"We're doing...
"
,,
5,8,"what you usually do
"
,,
5,8,"on a Thursday afternoon.
"
,,
5,8,"Masturbate?
"
,,
5,8,"That's it.
"
,,
5,8,"That's what we're going to do together.
"
,,
5,8,"Well, maybe back to back, but
"
,,
5,8,"I gotta tell you I'm not 100% on this.
"
,,
5,8,"Oh, there's the cute prom couple.
"
,,
5,8,"Hi, Mom. Is it cool if Brian and I
"
,,
5,8,"go to the mall this afternoon?
"
,,
5,8,"Actually, I thought I was pretty clear...
"
,,
5,8,"Oh, of course it's okay.
"
,,
5,8,"Ever since that dance,
"
,,
5,8,"you two have become such good friends.
"
,,
5,8," Who would have thought?
"
,,
5,8," Oh, we're more than friends, Mom.
"
,,
5,8," Last night at the dance, Brian...
"
,,
5,8," Last night, we decided to be best friends.
"
,,
5,8,"Right, Meg? Come on.
"
,,
5,8,"Let's go to the mall. We'll get ya...
"
,,
5,8,"get ya a big ol' pretzel.
"
,,
5,8,"I want a pretzel, too!
"
,,
5,8,"Everyone, this is Brian.
"
,,
5,8," Oh, this is Brian.
"
,,
5,8," He does look like Ben Affleck.
"
,,
5,8," He looks just like Ben Affleck.
"
,,
5,8," Is that Ben Affleck?
"
,,
5,8," Hey.
"
,,
5,8," So, how did you guys meet?
"
,,
5,8,"I'm, uh, a friend of her dad's.
"
,,
5,8," Ooh, he's older.
"
,,
5,8," He's cute.
"
,,
5,8," Do you have a brother?
"
,,
5,8," Makeup and stickers and ponies
"
,,
5,8,"and mySpace.com.
"
,,
5,8,"Brian's the first serious boyfriend
"
,,
5,8,"I've ever had.
"
,,
5,8,"Uh, Meg, can I talk to you
"
,,
5,8,"for a second?
"
,,
5,8,"Look, this has gone a little too far.
"
,,
5,8,"I like you. I think you're great, but
"
,,
5,8,"what happened at the dance was...
"
,,
5,8,"I mean, that kiss was just a mistake.
"
,,
5,8,"Oh, no. Did I do something wrong?
"
,,
5,8,"Was it because
"
,,
5,8,"I didn't sniff your butt first?
"
,,
5,8,"What? No! I mean, yes, that's how
"
,,
5,8,"I would know you're interested, but
"
,,
5,8,"Meg, the fact is that you and I are friends,
"
,,
5,8,"and that's the way it needs to stay.
"
,,
5,8,"Besides, I have a girlfriend.
"
,,
5,8,"I'm dating Jillian.
"
,,
5,8,"All right, Brian. I understand.
"
,,
5,8,"Good. I'm gonna grab Stewie,
"
,,
5,8,"and then we can go.
"
,,
5,8,"What's that, Brian?
"
,,
5,8,"Oh, you were just kidding.
"
,,
5,8,"I know you were.
"
,,
5,8,"I love you, too, Brian.
"
,,
5,8,"And you love me.
"
,,
5,8,"You do love me, Brian.
"
,,
5,8," Hey, Brian
"
,,
5,8," Oh, Meg, hey.
"
,,
5,8,"Hey, listen, I hope you're feeling all
"
,,
5,8,"right about out little talk the other day.
"
,,
5,8,"You know, about us being
"
,,
5,8,"just friends and all.
"
,,
5,8,"Yeah. No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
"
,,
5,8,"And...
"
,,
5,8,"hey, look, I wanted to thank you
"
,,
5,8,"for being so great to me.
"
,,
5,8," So, I baked you a pie.
"
,,
5,8," Oh, wow. Hey, that looks delicious.
"
,,
5,8,"Mmm, oh, this is good.
"
,,
5,8,"What's in there?
"
,,
5,8,"Well, there's some apples
"
,,
5,8,"and some cinnamon
"
,,
5,8," and my hair.
"
,,
5,8," What?
"
,,
5,8,"My hair's in the pie, Brian.
"
,,
5,8,"And now it's inside of you.
"
,,
5,8,"Part of me is inside of you, Brian.
"
,,
5,8,"Do you feel me, Brian?
"
,,
5,8,"Do you feel me inside of you?
"
,,
5,8,"Ooh, you got some pie, huh?
"
,,
5,8,"Can I have a piece?
"
,,
5,8," Uh, sure.
"
,,
5,8," Let me have some of that Cool ""Hwhip?""
"
,,
5,8," What'd you say?
"
,,
5,8," You can't have a pie without Cool Hwhip.
"
,,
5,8," Cool Hwhip?
"
,,
5,8," Cool Hwhip, yeah.
"
,,
5,8," You mean Cool Whip.
"
,,
5,8," Yeah, Cool Hwhip.
"
,,
5,8," Cool Whip.
"
,,
5,8," Cool Hwhip.
"
,,
5,8," Cool Whip.
"
,,
5,8," Cool Hwhip.
"
,,
5,8,"You're saying it weird. Why are you
"
,,
5,8,"putting so much emphasison the ""H""?
"
,,
5,8,"What are you talking about?
"
,,
5,8,"I'm just saying it, Cool Hwhip.
"
,,
5,8,"You put Cool Hwhip on pie.
"
,,
5,8,"Pie tastes better with Cool Hwhip.
"
,,
5,8," Say ""whip.""
"
,,
5,8," Whip.
"
,,
5,8," Now say Cool Whip.
"
,,
5,8," Cool Hwhip.
"
,,
5,8," Cool Whip.
"
,,
5,8," Cool Hwhip.
"
,,
5,8," Cool Whip.
"
,,
5,8," Cool Hwhip.
"
,,
5,8,"You're eating hair!
"
,,
5,8,"Well, Lois, I am now a graduate
"
,,
5,8,"of the Quahog Police Academy.
"
,,
5,8,"And an official on-duty cop.
"
,,
5,8,"I can't believe I'm married
"
,,
5,8,"to a big, scary police officer.
"
,,
5,8,"Just keep your eyes on the eggs, ma'am.
"
,,
5,8,"Yes, officer!
"
,,
5,8," You are such a dirty cop.
"
,,
5,8," Don't break those yolks, ma'am.
"
,,
5,8," Oh, my God, Lois, I hit you!
"
,,
5,8," I know.
"
,,
5,8,"Now stick your finger in there
"
,,
5,8,"and twist it!
"
,,
5,8,"Hey, uh, Lois, can I talk to you
"
,,
5,8,"for a second?
"
,,
5,8,"I think we may have
"
,,
5,8,"a problem with Meg.
"
,,
5,8,"You're telling me.
"
,,
5,8,"She's been locked in her room all day.
"
,,
5,8,"Who knows what she's doing
"
,,
5,8,"up there.
"
,,
5,8,"Yeah, well, the thing is, Meg is
"
,,
5,8,"becoming a little enamored with me,
"
,,
5,8,"and I'm kind of losing control
"
,,
5,8,"of the situation.
"
,,
5,8,"Oh, she's just grateful
"
,,
5,8,"you took her to the dance.
"
,,
5,8,"Well, uh, I think
"
,,
5,8,"it's more than that. Uh...
"
,,
5,8,"So, here's the thing, and don't get mad.
"
,,
5,8,"And that part I can't stress enough.
"
,,
5,8,"That's a great shirt, by the way.
"
,,
5,8,"Um, I may have made out with Meg.
"
,,
5,8,"Okay, I had that coming.
"
,,
5,8,"What the hell is wrong with you,
"
,,
5,8,"you sick bastard?!
"
,,
5,8," Look, I was drinking...
"
,,
5,8," Oh, what a shock!
"
,,
5,8,"Look, the short version is,
"
,,
5,8,"this morning, she made me
"
,,
5,8,"eat the hair in her pie.
"
,,
5,8,"No, it's not what you think.
"
,,
5,8,"Stewie had some, too.
"
,,
5,8," Stop punching me!
"
,,
5,8," Look, Brian,
"
,,
5,8,"I don't know what the hell happened
"
,,
5,8,"between you two,
"
,,
5,8,"but you'd better go upstairs
"
,,
5,8,"and straighten it out right now.
"
,,
5,8,"This is even worse than when you ate
"
,,
5,8,"that bubblegum out of the garbage.
"
,,
5,8,"Brian, did you get
"
,,
5,8,"into the garbage last night?
"
,,
5,8,"Uh, no. Why?
"
,,
5,8," Don't lie to me, Brian.
"
,,
5,8," I'm not lying.
"
,,
5,8,"Uh, Meg, you got a minute?
"
,,
5,8,"What the hell?
"
,,
5,8," I made that for you, Brian.
"
,,
5,8," Meg!
"
,,
5,8,"Look, you obviously didn't hear me
"
,,
5,8,"yesterday, so I'll explain it again.
"
,,
5,8,"And here to assist me is headmaster
"
,,
5,8,"of the New York School
"
,,
5,8,"For The Hard of Hearing,
"
,,
5,8,"Mr. Garret Morris.
"
,,
5,8,"Meg, we're not boyfriend and girlfriend.
"
,,
5,8,"We're not boyfriend and girlfriend!
"
,,
5,8,"I will never be attracted to you.
"
,,
5,8,"I will never be attracted to you!
"
,,
5,8,"You're acting like a psycho bitch.
"
,,
5,8,"You're acting like a psycho bitch!
"
,,
5,8,"Good night and have
"
,,
5,8,"a pleasant tomorrow.
"
,,
5,8,"Good night and have a pleasant tomorrow!
"
,,
5,8,"I won't be ignored, Brian.
"
,,
5,8,"Mm, I like your ass.
"
,,
5,8,"Joe, I gotta tell you,
"
,,
5,8,"this whole cop thing ain't as exciting
"
,,
5,8,"as I thought it was gonna be.
"
,,
5,8,"When do we get to shoot some bad guys?
"
,,
5,8,"Guys, it's not all about action.
"
,,
5,8,"It's about staying vigilant
"
,,
5,8,"until you're needed.
"
,,
5,8," What are you doing?
"
,,
5,8," I'm watching Bonnie undress.
"
,,
5,8," Bonnie's your wife.
"
,,
5,8," I know.
"
,,
5,8,"I like to watch her strip and pretend
"
,,
5,8,"she's a woman who I've never met,
"
,,
5,8,"but who looks just like Bonnie
"
,,
5,8,"and lives in my house.
"
,,
5,8,"Get naked, you strange whore!
"
,,
5,8,"Peter, I haven't seen Meg or Brian
"
,,
5,8,"since last night.
"
,,
5,8,"I think something may have happened.
"
,,
5,8,"Mom, is it bad if I saw Meg tie up
"
,,
5,8,"Brian last night,
"
,,
5,8,"put him in the trunk of his car
"
,,
5,8,"and then drive away?
"
,,
5,8,"What?!
"
,,
5,8,"Chris, why didn't you say anything?!
"
,,
5,8,"I dropped the ball. I'm sorry.
"
,,
5,8,"I have just been buried in paperwork
"
,,
5,8,"for the past 72 hours.
"
,,
5,8,"Oh, my God, Brian was right.
"
,,
5,8,"Meg really must be obsessed with him.
"
,,
5,8,"Peter, we got to find them.
"
,,
5,8,"Don't worry, Lois, we're the police,
"
,,
5,8,"and we'll do our very best
"
,,
5,8,"to find Brian and girl Chris.
"
,,
5,8,"I'm really having
"
,,
5,8,"a great time tonight, Brian.
"
,,
5,8,"I can't believe you went
"
,,
5,8,"to all this trouble.
"
,,
5,8," Well, you know me.
"
,,
5,8," Oh, I do, Brian.
"
,,
5,8,"I know you so well.
"
,,
5,8," So, are you ready?
"
,,
5,8," For what?
"
,,
5,8,"For the fun we're gonna have, Brian.
"
,,
5,8,"We're gonna have fun tonight.
"
,,
5,8,"Good, old-fashioned,
"
,,
5,8,"all-American fun.
"
,,
5,8,"Listen, Meg,
"
,,
5,8,"I'm not gonna lie to you here.
"
,,
5,8,"I'm a little uncomfortable.
"
,,
5,8,"Oh, just relax. We're gonna be here
"
,,
5,8,"for a ""hwhile.""
"
,,
5,8," Well, I don't know if... Wait, what?
"
,,
5,8," We're gonna be here for a hwhile.
"
,,
5,8," A hwhile?
"
,,
5,8," Yeah, a hwhile.
"
,,
5,8," You mean, a while.
"
,,
5,8," A hwhile.
"
,,
5,8," A while.
"
,,
5,8," A hwhile.
"
,,
5,8," A while.
"
,,
5,8," A hwhile.
"
,,
5,8," A while.
"
,,
5,8," Brian, you're acting ""wheird.""
"
,,
5,8,"Come on. That one doesn't even
"
,,
5,8,"have an ""H"" in it.
"
,,
5,8," Don't move, dirtbag!
"
,,
5,8," Holy crap, what the hell is this?
"
,,
5,8,"Brian, she's a teenager!
"
,,
5,8,"Yeah, Brian, you're doing the
"
,,
5,8,"same thing that Mia Farrow did
"
,,
5,8,"to that Oriental guy that Woody Allen
"
,,
5,8,"brought home from the circus.
"
,,
5,8,"Peter, hold on to that thought,
"
,,
5,8,"because I'm going to explain to you
"
,,
5,8,"when we get home all the things
"
,,
5,8,"that are wrong with that statement.
"
,,
5,8,"But first, Meg, you need to let Brian go.
"
,,
5,8," But, Mom, I love him!
"
,,
5,8," Honey, you're just confused.
"
,,
5,8,"I'm not confused!
"
,,
5,8,"I've never been more certain
"
,,
5,8,"about anything in my life!
"
,,
5,8,"I need him!
"
,,
5,8,"Meg, I know that's what
"
,,
5,8,"you think right now, but you're...
"
,,
5,8,"Oh, God, I wish
"
,,
5,8,"I could make you understand.
"
,,
5,8," You don't know what you need.
"
,,
5,8," I know what she needs.
"
,,
5,8," You do?
"
,,
5,8," You bet.
"
,,
5,8,"Bring her by my house around
"
,,
5,8,"Hi, Mr. Quagmire.
"
,,
5,8,"Mom said I should come over here.
"
,,
5,8,"Have a seat, Meg.
"
,,
5,8,"Soon it'll all become clear.
"
,,
5,8,"Excuse me, while I get a
"
,,
5,8,"little more comfortable.
"
,,
5,8,"Meg, I've watched you grow up
"
,,
5,8,"from a playful little girl
"
,,
5,8,"into a very special young woman.
"
,,
5,8,"Now you probably just think of me as
"
,,
5,8,"square old Mr. Quagmire from next door,
"
,,
5,8,"but I've been around the block
"
,,
5,8,"a few times,
"
,,
5,8,"learned a couple things,
"
,,
5,8,"and I can tell you this,
"
,,
5,8,"there's no reason to grow up too fast.
"
,,
5,8,"Teenage girls are exposed
"
,,
5,8,"to so much these days.
"
,,
5,8,"I can see why a relationship
"
,,
5,8,"looks glamorous,
"
,,
5,8,"but you've got all the time in the world
"
,,
5,8,"and a lot of wonderful experiences
"
,,
5,8,"ahead of ya.
"
,,
5,8,"Hang on. I want to give you something.
"
,,
5,8,"This book helped me
"
,,
5,8,"when I was about your age.
"
,,
5,8,"It let me know that as long
"
,,
5,8,"as I kept on rolling,
"
,,
5,8,"I'd find that one person
"
,,
5,8,"who would make me whole.
"
,,
5,8," Thanks, Mr. Quagmire.
"
,,
5,8," You don't have to thank me.
"
,,
5,8,"Now get on out of here,
"
,,
5,8,"you little scamp.
"
,,
5,8," All right, ladies, you ready for action?
"
,,
5,8," We sure are, Glen.
"

5,8," Do you have the ""hwhip""?
"

5,9,"Oh, Peter, you're selling your anvil?
"
,,
5,9,"Yeah, I've had a lot of good times
"
,,
5,9,"with this thing.
"
,,
5,9,"Ooh! A dollar!
"
,,
5,9," Hey there, Chris.
"
,,
5,9," Hi, Mr. Herbert.
"
,,
5,9," Selling your old hand-me-downs?
"
,,
5,9," Yep.
"
,,
5,9,"You got anything you used
"
,,
5,9,"to wear in the summertime?
"
,,
5,9," Just these old shorts.
"
,,
5,9," Sweet Jesus.
"
,,
5,9," Give you a dollar for this.
"
,,
5,9," Sold.
"
,,
5,9,"Brian, where's Rupert?
"
,,
5,9,"I just left him here to watch my things.
"
,,
5,9," What?
"
,,
5,9," Uh, nothing, I haven't seen him.
"
,,
5,9,"It's not like him to wander off.
"
,,
5,9,"Rupert? Rupert!
"
,,
5,9,"Oh, no. What if he's been kidnapped?
"
,,
5,9," Well, let's just calm down...
"
,,
5,9," I've got to save him, Brian.
"
,,
5,9,"What if he's dead?
"
,,
5,9,"I don't think I can handle a funeral.
"
,,
5,9,"Of all the souls I have
"
,,
5,9,"encountered in my travels,
"
,,
5,9,"his was the most...
"
,,
5,9,"human.
"
,,
5,9,"Orders... hup!
"
,,
5,9,"Holy crap.
"
,,
5,9,"Evel Knievel gloves!
"
,,
5,9,"I bet I could do a wheelie with these!
"
,,
5,9,"How much for the gloves?
"
,,
5,9," Peter, those are yours.
"
,,
5,9," Ten bucks.
"
,,
5,9,"Two. Seven. Four. $5.50. Ten. Sold!
"
,,
5,9,"Sucker. I would've gone
"
,,
5,9,"to $15, easy. I am so stupid.
"
,,
5,9,"Awesome!
"
,,
5,9,"Peter, you can't drive the car over that.
"
,,
5,9,"You're gonna get hurt.
"
,,
5,9,"Lois, I don't come down to Burger King
"
,,
5,9,"and tell you how to do your job.
"
,,
5,9," Peter, I don't work at Burger...
"
,,
5,9," I don't work at burgaga... I'm busy.
"
,,
5,9,"Now if you'll excuse me,
"
,,
5,9,"I have some death to defy.
"
,,
5,9,"This is just like what happened with
"
,,
5,9,"Matthew Broderick, except no one's dead.
"
,,
5,9," Hey, Joe.
"
,,
5,9," Good morning, Peter.
"
,,
5,9," I'm here to revoke your driver's license.
"
,,
5,9," What?! Why?!
"
,,
5,9,"We got reckless driving,
"
,,
5,9,"disturbing the peace,
"
,,
5,9,"plus the driver of one of
"
,,
5,9,"the other cars was a virgin
"
,,
5,9,"whose hymen was busted
"
,,
5,9,"by the airbag, so rape.
"
,,
5,9,"Okay, well, I guess
"
,,
5,9,"you can take my license.
"
,,
5,9,"'Course it's all the way up here.
"
,,
5,9,"Peter, knock if off. Give it to me.
"
,,
5,9,"Give me the damn license.
"
,,
5,9,"This is in poor taste, Peter.
"
,,
5,9,"You're starting to piss me off.
"
,,
5,9,"You're starting to piss me off!
"
,,
5,9,"Aw, man, this sucks. I got no license.
"
,,
5,9,"I can't go anywhere.
"
,,
5,9,"Well, this is your own fault, Peter,
"
,,
5,9,"and if you want my opinion,
"
,,
5,9,"a little time away from the bar
"
,,
5,9,"will do you some good.
"
,,
5,9,"I'll show her.
"
,,
5,9,"I'll just go to another bar.
"
,,
5,9," And Peter! Yeah!
"
,,
5,9,"How's life in the fast lane, Mr. Peterson?
"
,,
5,9," Griffin.
"
,,
5,9," I can't find the on-ramp, Woody.
"
,,
5,9,"He was talking to me, Norm.
"
,,
5,9,"Quit stealing my punch lines,
"
,,
5,9,"you fat drunk.
"
,,
5,9,"That show stopped being funny after
"
,,
5,9,"Kirstie Alley ate Shelley Long.
"
,,
5,9,"Ah, man, now I can't even watch TV.
"
,,
5,9,"What the hell am I gonna do all day?
"
,,
5,9,"That's all right, that's okay.
"
,,
5,9,"I don't need TV.
"
,,
5,9,"I'll just make my own sitcom in my head.
"
,,
5,9,"And I'll give it
"
,,
5,9,"an upbeat '80s sitcom theme.
"
,,
5,9,"with that lady, but I did.</i>
"
,,
5,9,"Why have you brought me
"
,,
5,9,"to the toy store, Brian?
"
,,
5,9,"I'm buying you another Rupert.
"
,,
5,9,"Hey, this one's cute, huh?
"
,,
5,9,"And if we buy it,
"
,,
5,9,"they save a real gorilla in the wild.
"
,,
5,9,"And if we don't, they kill one.
"
,,
5,9,"Wow, these guys are playing hardball.
"
,,
5,9,"You can't just take some Korean-made
"
,,
5,9,"velveteen primate and call it Rupert.
"
,,
5,9,"Now come on, this is all time we could
"
,,
5,9,"be using to find Rupert's kidnappers.
"
,,
5,9,"Look, I, uh...
"
,,
5,9,"I may as well come clean with you.
"
,,
5,9,"Rupert wasn't kidnapped.
"
,,
5,9,"I accidentally sold him at the yard sale.
"
,,
5,9,"You son of a bitch!
"
,,
5,9,"Come on, Stewie, I'm really sorry.
"
,,
5,9,"It was an accident.
"
,,
5,9,"Damn you, Brian.
"
,,
5,9,"How could you sell Rupert?
"
,,
5,9,"What you've done is more horrible
"
,,
5,9,"than sex with Sharon Stone.
"
,,
5,9,"Wow, that was great!
"
,,
5,9,"One minute I'm filling up at Chevron,
"
,,
5,9,"and the next I'm having sex
"
,,
5,9,"with Sharon Stone.
"
,,
5,9,"Yeah. Now comes the best part.
"
,,
5,9," Get out of the fridge, Peter.
"
,,
5,9," There is no Peter, only Zuul.
"
,,
5,9,"I said get out of the fridge!
"
,,
5,9,"All right, all right! Geez, Lois,
"
,,
5,9,"I'm just trying to amuse myself,
"
,,
5,9,"since I don't have a damn
"
,,
5,9,"driver's license.
"
,,
5,9,"Peter, it's getting a little annoying
"
,,
5,9,"having you around the house all the time.
"
,,
5,9,"So you'll be happy to know
"
,,
5,9,"I got you your own personal driver.
"
,,
5,9,"My own driver?! Holy crap,
"
,,
5,9,"that's awesome! Where is he?
"
,,
5,9," She's right here, Peter.
"
,,
5,9," Meg?!
"
,,
5,9,"Yeah, Dad. I don't mind driving you
"
,,
5,9,"around till you get your license back.
"
,,
5,9,"What?!
"
,,
5,9,"Lois, this is the best you could do?!
"
,,
5,9,"Well, it was either Meg
"
,,
5,9,"or a talking monkey smoking a cigar,
"
,,
5,9,"but I didn't you'd like that.
"
,,
5,9,"I've already accepted another job.
"
,,
5,9,"Lois, you picked the opposite
"
,,
5,9,"thing that I would like.
"
,,
5,9,"It's all right.
"
,,
5,9,"I would've driven you bananas.
"
,,
5,9,"Oh, oh, and he makes jokes.
"
,,
5,9,"Nice going, Lois.
"
,,
5,9,"Dad, are you ready?
"
,,
5,9," What exactly are you trying to do?
"
,,
5,9," It's very simple, Brian.
"
,,
5,9,"I've taken DNA from the dollar bill
"
,,
5,9,"you were paid for Rupert.
"
,,
5,9,"Now to check that DNA
"
,,
5,9,"against the federal database.
"
,,
5,9,"Ooh, we have a match!
"
,,
5,9,"Stanford Cordray, 89 Spooner Street.
"
,,
5,9,"That's only a few blocks away.
"
,,
5,9,"Let's go!
"
,,
5,9,"Hello? Hello?
"
,,
5,9,"It can't be.
"
,,
5,9,"This house is deserted.
"
,,
5,9,"He moved. He's gone.
"
,,
5,9,"Rupert's gone.
"
,,
5,9,"Wait a minute, look!
"
,,
5,9,"The moving truck.
"
,,
5,9,"We're not too late.
"
,,
5,9," Can I help you, gentlemen?
"
,,
5,9," Follow that truck.
"
,,
5,9,"Didn't you hear me?
"
,,
5,9,"I said, ""Follow that truck.""
"
,,
5,9,"Oh, I heard you.
"
,,
5,9,"What I didn't hear was, ""Please.""
"
,,
5,9,"I always enjoy traveling companions.
"
,,
5,9,"Let's play 20 questions.
"
,,
5,9,"Am I Bo Bice? Yes, I am.
"
,,
5,9,"Well played, worthy adversary.
"
,,
5,9,"We're gaining on him!
"
,,
5,9,"I'm coming, Rupert!
"
,,
5,9," I'm sorry, but I can go no further.
"
,,
5,9," What?! Why not?!
"
,,
5,9,"If I enter Connecticut,
"
,,
5,9,"I'm entering every state
"
,,
5,9,"that Connecticut's ever been with.
"
,,
5,9,"Good luck, brave travelers.
"
,,
5,9,"No! We were so close!
"
,,
5,9,"I say, what a bit of serendipity.
"
,,
5,9,"Now we've got that fellow's address.
"
,,
5,9,"Let's see...
"
,,
5,9,"""Aspen, Colorado.""
"
,,
5,9,"Well, you can forget that.
"
,,
5,9,"We're not going all the way to Aspen.
"
,,
5,9,"What?!
"
,,
5,9,"But I can't leave Rupert to perish.
"
,,
5,9,"For the rest of my life,
"
,,
5,9,"I'll be as lonely
"
,,
5,9,"as Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell
"
,,
5,9,"after the rapture.
"
,,
5,9,"Damn it, Jerry, why are
"
,,
5,9,"we the only ones still here?
"
,,
5,9,"I don't know, we hated
"
,,
5,9,"all the right things.
"
,,
5,9," Now there's nothing left to hate.
"
,,
5,9," I'm gonna hate that rock.
"
,,
5,9," No, I'm gonna hate that rock.
"
,,
5,9," Let's both hate that rock.
"
,,
5,9," I hate you.
"
,,
5,9," I hate you, too.
"
,,
5,9,"Look, Stewie,
"
,,
5,9,"don't you think, at some point,
"
,,
5,9,"you're gonna have to let Rupert go?
"
,,
5,9,"I mean, you are getting a
"
,,
5,9,"little old to have a teddy bear.
"
,,
5,9," Brian, I'm one!
"
,,
5,9," Still? What?
"
,,
5,9,"Look, I'm not going to Colorado.
"
,,
5,9,"I'm turning around and going home.
"
,,
5,9,"Fine, then, I'll go by myself.
"
,,
5,9,"See you from the back of my milk carton.
"
,,
5,9,"Want that on your conscience, Brian?
"
,,
5,9,"Try explaining this to Lois.
"
,,
5,9,"You'll wind up in a Dumpster with a
"
,,
5,9,"bunch of slow, unadoptable greyhounds.
"
,,
5,9,"Don't joke about that.
"
,,
5,9,"That's like the Holocaust to us.
"
,,
5,9,"Yeah, well, when greyhounds
"
,,
5,9,"start running The New York Times
"
,,
5,9,"and the World Bank,
"
,,
5,9,"I'll be more inclined to believe you.
"
,,
5,9,"Now, are you coming or not?
"
,,
5,9,"Fine.
"
,,
5,9,"Won't you lend me your name...</i>
"
,,
5,9," Who sings that song?
"
,,
5,9," James Taylor.
"
,,
5,9,"Yeah, let's keep it that way.
"
,,
5,9,"This sucks. Can you believe
"
,,
5,9,"I'm stuck with Meg driving me around?
"
,,
5,9,"Dad, it's just you and me in the car.
"
,,
5,9,"Don't remind me.
"
,,
5,9,"It's bad enough
"
,,
5,9,"I got a suspended license,
"
,,
5,9,"I gotta ride around town
"
,,
5,9,"with Stinky McPoop-Pants.
"
,,
5,9," I want apple juice.
"
,,
5,9," Dad, you left your apple juice at home.
"
,,
5,9,"I want apple juice!
"
,,
5,9," You want to watch SpongeBob?
"
,,
5,9," Yes.
"
,,
5,9,"With apple juice.
"
,,
5,9,"SpongeBob.
"
,,
5,9,"Thanks for the ride, Bandit.
"
,,
5,9,"Good luck tapping some of that
"
,,
5,9,"hot, hot Sally Field tail.
"
,,
5,9,"Knock it off. I don't like it
"
,,
5,9,"any more than you do.
"
,,
5,9,"Where the hell are we?
"
,,
5,9,"Oh, this is history right here, Brian.
"
,,
5,9,"Gettysburg. Billy Yanks. The 20th Maine.
"
,,
5,9,"So many lives lost.
"
,,
5,9,"All in pursuit of the ideal that no man
"
,,
5,9,"should be subjugated
"
,,
5,9,"because of the color of his skin.
"
,,
5,9,"These boys paid the ultimate price here.
"
,,
5,9,"For equality. For humanity.
"
,,
5,9," You're welcome.
"
,,
5,9," I'm sorry?
"
,,
5,9,"I'm just sayin', make it
"
,,
5,9,"worth our while, you know?
"
,,
5,9,"We wrote a pretty big check
"
,,
5,9,"for you folks here, so, um...
"
,,
5,9,"You know, whatever. It's fine. It's fine.
"
,,
5,9,"Doesn't matter. Just, uh... I...
"
,,
5,9,"Just hope you're making the best
"
,,
5,9,"of what we gave you here.
"
,,
5,9,"I would say that,
"
,,
5,9,"given the events that preceded it,
"
,,
5,9,"the couple hundred years or so,
"
,,
5,9,"maybe we're about even.
"
,,
5,9,"Yeah, no, no. We gave more.
"
,,
5,9,"Hey, Cleveland,
"
,,
5,9,"who would you rather do :
"
,,
5,9,"Queen Latifah or Halle Berry,
"
,,
5,9,"but she's been dead for six hours?
"
,,
5,9,"Aw, man.
"
,,
5,9,"That's a tough one.
"
,,
5,9,"God, will you guys
"
,,
5,9,"just shut up back there?!
"
,,
5,9,"Aah! Gross!
"
,,
5,9,"Would you stop it? Stop it!
"
,,
5,9,"Hey, guys, check this out.
"
,,
5,9,"Hey, Meg, don't be such a hothead.
"
,,
5,9,"What?!
"
,,
5,9,"Hey, Meg, you sure look hot today.
"
,,
5,9,"What?!
"
,,
5,9,"Hey, Meg, I lit your scalp on fire.
"
,,
5,9,"Don't worry, I'll put it out.
"
,,
5,9,"What the hell is your problem,
"
,,
5,9,"you dumb bimbo?!
"
,,
5,9,"Oh, oh, God, stop!
"
,,
5,9,"Meg, that was awesome.
"
,,
5,9,"If we wanna get to Aspen, we're gonna
"
,,
5,9,"have to get over those mountains somehow.
"
,,
5,9,"Excuse me, uh, how much is it
"
,,
5,9,"to rent a helicopter?
"
,,
5,9,"It's ten bucks an hour.
"
,,
5,9,"But there's a $100,000 deposit.
"
,,
5,9,"Oh, God.
"
,,
5,9,"Looks like we're walking.
"
,,
5,9,"Wait a minute, it says here
"
,,
5,9,"you accept cash, check or a jaunty tune.
"
,,
5,9,"Well, this rental agreement
"
,,
5,9,"was drafted back
"
,,
5,9,"when musicals were culturally relevant.
"
,,
5,9,"Unfortunately, that's no longer the case.
"
,,
5,9,"Well, I can prove to you
"
,,
5,9,"that's a whole lot of nonsense.
"
,,
5,9,"is dated boring and dry.</i>
"
,,
5,9,"like it if you give it a try.</i>
"
,,
5,9,"as gaily as an elf.</i>
"
,,
5,9,"ask the man himself.</i>
"
,,
5,9,"Mr. Kelly?
"
,,
5,9,"Will you show us?
"
,,
5,9," I'll show you.
"
,,
5,9," Let's do it.
"
,,
5,9," Good. <i>One, two, three, four.
"
,,
5,9," One, two, three, four.</i>
"
,,
5,9,"  One, two, three.</i>
"
,,
5,9," La, la, la, la, la, la.</i>
"
,,
5,9," You see?
"
,,
5,9," It's easy.
"
,,
5,9,"Look at me! I'm dancing!
"
,,
5,9,"Okay, you can have the helicopter.
"
,,
5,9,"Brian, be careful 'cause the mountains
"
,,
5,9,"are the same color as the sky.
"
,,
5,9,"What?
"
,,
5,9,"I said, be careful 'cause the mountains
"
,,
5,9,"are the same color as the...
"
,,
5,9," What the hell was that?
"
,,
5,9," I'm practicing my comedy crash.
"
,,
5,9,"Well, keep it down
"
,,
5,9,"'cause I'm trying to...
"
,,
5,9,"Imagine the dance I'm gonna have
"
,,
5,9,"to do to get our security deposit back.
"
,,
5,9,"Oh, my God! Brian, look!
"
,,
5,9,"It's Aspen. We made it.
"
,,
5,9,"Well, looks like you're gonna be
"
,,
5,9,"reunited with Rupert after all.
"
,,
5,9,"And just in time, too.
"
,,
5,9,"I can't keep my teeth from chattering.
"
,,
5,9,"Isn't that fun?
"
,,
5,9,"I got these at Jack's Joke Shop
"
,,
5,9,"in South Attleboro, Massachusetts.
"
,,
5,9,"Remember, if it ain't funny,
"
,,
5,9,"it ain't worth Jack.
"
,,
5,9,"Bitch.
"
,,
5,9,"Aw, you should've seen what
"
,,
5,9,"our amazing, freakin' daughter
"
,,
5,9,"did to that guy, Lois.
"
,,
5,9,"She kicked his ass.
"
,,
5,9," It was like what life did to Dana Plato.
"
,,
5,9," Meg, how could you do that?!
"
,,
5,9,"You should call that man and apologize.
"
,,
5,9,"Hey, hey, hey.
"
,,
5,9,"Don't you talk to her like that.
"
,,
5,9,"Meg's as cool as the
"
,,
5,9,"other side of the pillow.
"
,,
5,9," Billy Dee Williams.
"
,,
5,9," Hello, Peter.
"
,,
5,9,"Welcome to the cool side of the pillow.
"
,,
5,9,"You've had a hard day.
"
,,
5,9,"Rest that weary head of yours
"
,,
5,9,"and drift on off to dreamland.
"
,,
5,9,"Works every time.
"
,,
5,9,"Well, this is the place.
"
,,
5,9,"Looks pretty fancy.
"
,,
5,9," Can I help you?
"
,,
5,9," Uh, yes, my name's Brian, um...
"
,,
5,9,"Look, to make a long story short,
"
,,
5,9,"I accidentally sold you a teddy bear
"
,,
5,9,"back in Rhode Island, and...
"
,,
5,9,"I kind of need it back.
"
,,
5,9," Rupert! It's, it's Rupert!
"
,,
5,9," Stanford, who is it?
"
,,
5,9,"It's nothing, dear, I'll handle it.
"
,,
5,9,"I'm sorry, but that bear belongs
"
,,
5,9,"to Timmy. Now, please leave.
"
,,
5,9,"Wait, wait. How about a ski off?
"
,,
5,9," What...?
"
,,
5,9," You heard me.
"
,,
5,9,"First one down the mountain wins.
"
,,
5,9,"If I win, I get Rupert.
"
,,
5,9,"Interesting. What do I get if I win?
"
,,
5,9," My dog.
"
,,
5,9," Hmm. What can he do?
"
,,
5,9,"If you put peanut butter anywhere
"
,,
5,9,"on your body, he'll lick it off.
"
,,
5,9,"Anywhere.
"
,,
5,9,"Well, I did go to Choate.
"
,,
5,9,"All right, it's a deal.
"
,,
5,9,"who's not too shy.</i>
"
,,
5,9,"like I hoped she would.</i>
"
,,
5,9,"like I hoped she would.</i>
"
,,
5,9,"I'm into somethin' good...</i>
"
,,
5,9,"You know, Dad, it's been really great
"
,,
5,9,"hanging out with you.
"
,,
5,9,"I know there's probably a million
"
,,
5,9,"things you'd rather be doing.
"
,,
5,9,"Are you kidding, Meg?
"
,,
5,9,"I've had more fun with you than I did
"
,,
5,9,"going to see Lost in Translation
"
,,
5,9,"with Cleveland and Quagmire.
"
,,
5,9," What do you think he whisper to her?
"
,,
5,9," I'll bet it was just right.
"
,,
5,9,"Look, I know sometimes
"
,,
5,9,"I give you a hard time.
"
,,
5,9,"You know, calling you names,
"
,,
5,9,"reading your diary,
"
,,
5,9,"farting in your cereal
"
,,
5,9,"when you go to get milk
"
,,
5,9,"and then laughing : ""Ha-ha ha!
"
,,
5,9,"She doesn't know she's eating my fart.""
"
,,
5,9,"But, you know, Meg,
"
,,
5,9,"I'm starting to realize
"
,,
5,9," I got a really wonderful daughter.
"
,,
5,9," Thanks, Dad.
"
,,
5,9,"Peter, good news. Your suspension is up.
"
,,
5,9,"You can have your license back.
"
,,
5,9,"You... you mean it? I'm free?
"
,,
5,9,"No more getting driven around?
"
,,
5,9,"Aw, sweet!
"
,,
5,9,"So, I guess this means
"
,,
5,9,"you don't need me anymore.
"
,,
5,9,"You'll probably go back to
"
,,
5,9,"treating me like crap, huh?
"
,,
5,9,"Well, maybe just to keep up
"
,,
5,9,"appearances in front of the family.
"
,,
5,9,"You know, peer pressure and all that.
"
,,
5,9,"But from now on, Meg,
"
,,
5,9,"you and me are secret best friends.
"
,,
5,9,"Who wants a glass of fresh lemonade?
"
,,
5,9,"Not me!
"
,,
5,9,"What I want is a fresh glass
"
,,
5,9,"of better daughter!
"
,,
5,9,"Stewie, do you really think
"
,,
5,9,"you can beat this guy?
"
,,
5,9,"Trust me, Brian, I've got
"
,,
5,9,"a few tricks up my sleeve.
"
,,
5,9,"Oh, no, if only I had rockets in my skis.
"
,,
5,9,"Oh, wait, I totally have rockets
"
,,
5,9,"in my skis.
"
,,
5,9,"And now I just sit back,
"
,,
5,9,"relax and watch my progress.
"
,,
5,9," Tea, sir?
"
,,
5,9," Oh, thank you, Crone.
"
,,
5,9,"You're so pleasant.
"
,,
5,9,"Would you like to check
"
,,
5,9,"on the race, sir?
"
,,
5,9,"Yes, why not.
"
,,
5,9,"Well, that's it, I suppose.
"
,,
5,9,"Listen, I'm, I'm really sorry, Stewie.
"
,,
5,9," I know how much Rupert meant to you.
"
,,
5,9," I don't know, Brian,
"
,,
5,9,"maybe this is a sign that you were right.
"
,,
5,9,"Maybe I am getting too old for Rupert.
"
,,
5,9,"I guess I've just got to let him go.
"
,,
5,9,"That's very grown up of you, Stewie.
"
,,
5,9,"Hey, dog, let's go.
"
,,
5,9,"My dad won you fair and square.
"
,,
5,9,"You're not really gonna
"
,,
5,9,"live with them, are you?
"
,,
5,9,"No.
"
,,
5,9,"You're not really over Rupert are you?
"
,,
5,9," No.
"
,,
5,9," That's what I thought.
"
,,
5,9,"Oh, Crone.
"
,,
5,9," How are we gonna get out of here?
"
,,
5,9," You still got the starting gun?
"
,,
5,9," Yeah.
"
,,
5,9," Give it to me.
"
,,
5,9,"Get out of the fucking car! Get out
"
,,
5,9,"of the fucking car right now, man!
"
,,
5,9," Oh, Jesus!
"
,,
5,9," Get out of the fucking car.
"
,,
5,9,"Do it! I don't give a fuck!
"
,,
5,9,"I'll fucking kill you!
"
,,
5,9,"Get out of this fucking car!
"
,,
5,9," Did we just carjack someone?
"
,,
5,9," We sure did, Brian.
"
,,
5,9,"We sure did.

5,10,"Um, Mom, Dad, um,
"
,,
5,10,"I decided I want a big party
"
,,
5,10,"this year with all my friends.
"
,,
5,10,"And maybe a band. Is that cool?
"
,,
5,10," Yeah, sure...
"
,,
5,10," Yeah, sure. Why not?
"
,,
5,10,"Oh, thanks, guys! You're the best!
"
,,
5,10,"What's she talking about?
"
,,
5,10,"A party for what?
"
,,
5,10,"I don't know. She have her period
"
,,
5,10,"or something? She getting married?
"
,,
5,10,"No. If she was getting married,
"
,,
5,10,"we probably would've seen
"
,,
5,10,"a guy around, right?
"
,,
5,10," Sound reasoning.
"
,,
5,10," You guys,
"
,,
5,10,"it's Meg's birthday next week.
"
,,
5,10,"Oh, my God, it is!
"
,,
5,10,"Peter, we got to put together a party!
"
,,
5,10,"Ah, man, I hate kids' birthday parties.
"
,,
5,10,"This is gonna be worse than that time
"
,,
5,10,"I was stuck behind Robert Loggia
"
,,
5,10,"at the airport.
"
,,
5,10," May I have your name, please?
"
,,
5,10," Robert Loggia.
"
,,
5,10," Can you spell that for me?
"
,,
5,10," Certainly. That's Robert Loggia.

5,10,"""R"" as in Robert Loggia,

"
,,
5,10," Here you are, Brian.
"
,,
5,10," What's this?
"
,,
5,10,"It's an invitation to Meg's party.
"
,,
5,10,"I'm the party planner.
"
,,
5,10,"You have to RSVP.
"
,,
5,10,"You can do it right now if you want.
"
,,
5,10,"All right, fine,
"
,,
5,10,"I'll come to Meg's party.
"
,,
5,10,"No, you have to call the RSVP line.
"
,,
5,10," You got to be kidding me.
"
,,
5,10," I'm waiting.
"
,,
5,10,"Ring, ring.
"
,,
5,10,"Aren't you gonna pick it up?
"
,,
5,10,"No, I'm not gonna pick it up
"
,,
5,10,"on the first few rings. I'm busy.
"
,,
5,10,"Maybe I'm in the other room.
"
,,
5,10,"Ring, ring.
"
,,
5,10,"Ring, ring.
"
,,
5,10,"Ring, ring.
"
,,
5,10," Ring... Oh, come on!
"
,,
5,10," Hello!
"
,,
5,10," Stewie?
"
,,
5,10," No, this is Stewie's housekeeper,
"
,,
5,10,"Mrs. Pennyapple. I'll see if he's in.
"
,,
5,10,"Stewie! Stewie!
"
,,
5,10," Yes, Mrs. Pennyapple?
"
,,
5,10," You've got a telephone call.
"
,,
5,10," Who is it?
"
,,
5,10," He didn't say.
"
,,
5,10," Well, find out, would you?
"
,,
5,10," Who is this?
"
,,
5,10," It's Brian.
"
,,
5,10," It's Brian!
"
,,
5,10,"Oh, Brian. Probably RSVPing
"
,,
5,10,"about Megan's party.
"
,,
5,10," Hello, Brian.
"
,,
5,10," Hi, Stewie.
"
,,
5,10," What can I do for you?
"
,,
5,10," I'm coming to Meg's party.
"
,,
5,10,"Oh, splendid. Just give your
"
,,
5,10,"information to Mrs. Pennyapple.
"
,,
5,10,"Hello, it's Mrs. Pennyapple again.
"
,,
5,10,"Shall I put you down for two, Brendan?
"
,,
5,10," Brian.
"
,,
5,10," Ryan?
"
,,
5,10," Brian!
"
,,
5,10," Mitchell?
"
,,
5,10," What?
"
,,
5,10," Good-bye.
"
,,
5,10,"Hey, Lois, I'm ordering a birthday cake,
"
,,
5,10,"and the guy wants to know how old
"
,,
5,10,"Meg is. I didn't know what to tell him.
"
,,
5,10," You're asking me?
"
,,
5,10," Yeah. How old is Meg?
"
,,
5,10," I don't know.
"
,,
5,10," Well, my God, Lois,
"
,,
5,10,"I thought you were the one
"
,,
5,10,"keeping track of that.
"
,,
5,10,"No, no. I have no idea.
"
,,
5,10,"Don't you remember me faking
"
,,
5,10,"my way through her last birthday?
"
,,
5,10,"Going on hmm-hmm.</i>
"
,,
5,10,"Should we...
"
,,
5,10,"Should we just ask her how old she is?
"
,,
5,10,"That, uh...
"
,,
5,10,"that'd be kind of awkward, huh?
"
,,
5,10,"Hey, maybe we should just cut off
"
,,
5,10,"her leg and count the rings.
"
,,
5,10,"Yeah. Or maybe try carbon dating.
"
,,
5,10,"I don't know what that is.
"
,,
5,10,"You know, we're gonna have
"
,,
5,10,"to talk to her
"
,,
5,10,"and kind of steer the conversation
"
,,
5,10,"in a way that gets her to spill it.
"
,,
5,10,"Come in.
"
,,
5,10," Hi, sweetie.
"
,,
5,10," Hey, Meg.
"
,,
5,10,"So, Meg, your birthday's coming up, huh?
"
,,
5,10,"You excited about turning...
"
,,
5,10,"Uh, Meg,
"
,,
5,10,"I got 16 candles for your birthday cake.
"
,,
5,10," How does that sound?
"
,,
5,10," That's not right.
"
,,
5,10,"So... less...?
"
,,
5,10,"More...?
"
,,
5,10,"Too many...?
"
,,
5,10," Not enough?
"
,,
5,10," You stupid son of a bitch!
"
,,
5,10,"You didn't even know how old I am!
"
,,
5,10,"Meg, that kind of language is not
"
,,
5,10,"appropriate for a girl your age.
"
,,
5,10," Or is it?
"
,,
5,10," I'm gonna be 17, you jerks!
"
,,
5,10,"She's the jerk.
"
,,
5,10,"All right, come on in, everybody.
"
,,
5,10,"Have a seat anywhere.
"
,,
5,10,"Meg's gonna open her
"
,,
5,10,"presents in a little bit.
"
,,
5,10,"Oh, Francis,
"
,,
5,10,"I'm glad you could make it.
"
,,
5,10,"Here! This for Megan!
"
,,
5,10," Oh. What is it?
"
,,
5,10," It's a cookie
"
,,
5,10," from lunch period at the home!
"
,,
5,10," Well, I'm sure she'll love this.
"
,,
5,10,"I want to see her eat it!
"
,,
5,10,"So the man asks the bartender
"
,,
5,10,"to recommend a good drink.
"
,,
5,10,"The bartender says, ""A Grasshopper.""
"
,,
5,10,"So the guy orders a Grasshopper.
"
,,
5,10,"Then he's walking home
"
,,
5,10,"and along the way,
"
,,
5,10,"he notices a grasshopper on the ground.
"
,,
5,10,"So he says to the grasshopper : ""Hey,
"
,,
5,10,"you know there's a drink
"
,,
5,10,"named after you?""
"
,,
5,10,"The grasshopper says :
"
,,
5,10,"""You mean there's a drink named Irving?""
"
,,
5,10,"So which one of you wants
"
,,
5,10,"to lose your virginity?
"
,,
5,10,"Mom, this party sucks!
"
,,
5,10,"I mean, balloons? Pin the tail on
"
,,
5,10,"the donkey? I'm not five years old.
"
,,
5,10,"Meg, your father worked very
"
,,
5,10,"hard to put this party together.
"
,,
5,10,"He says he's got a big surprise for you.
"
,,
5,10,"Hey, kids, I'm Peepants,
"
,,
5,10,"the inebriated hobo clown.
"
,,
5,10,"I'm an adorable tramp who wears found
"
,,
5,10,"clothing and eats out of your garbage can.
"
,,
5,10,"A clown?! Dad, I'm 17!
"
,,
5,10,"Meg, guess what Peepants
"
,,
5,10,"got you for your birthday.
"
,,
5,10," A scarf.
"
,,
5,10," I don't want a scarf, Dad.
"
,,
5,10,"Well, then how about...
"
,,
5,10,"a dozen scarves?!
"
,,
5,10,"Peter, I don't think you're actually
"
,,
5,10,"supposed to swallow those.
"
,,
5,10," Here you go, Meg.
"
,,
5,10," I don't want them!
"
,,
5,10,"Take them!
"
,,
5,10,"Are my long john stied
"
,,
5,10,"to the end of those?
"
,,
5,10," No.
"
,,
5,10," Oh, God.
"
,,
5,10,"Mom, can I just open my presents now?
"
,,
5,10," All right, Meg.
"
,,
5,10," Thank you.
"
,,
5,10," What the...?
"
,,
5,10," Let's see what else we've got here.
"
,,
5,10,"The first season of
"
,,
5,10,"Sister, Sister on DVD?
"
,,
5,10,"You're welcome.
"
,,
5,10,"Stewie, what are you doing?!
"
,,
5,10,"You can't open Meg's gifts!
"
,,
5,10,"These are mine, you hear me?
"
,,
5,10,"Mine!
"
,,
5,10,"Oh, God, not the ""mine"" phase.
"
,,
5,10,"I've been dreading this day.
"
,,
5,10,"I'm entitled to these things, Lois.
"
,,
5,10,"Especially after I got shafted
"
,,
5,10,"by that Asian Santa at the mall.
"
,,
5,10,"What you want?!
"
,,
5,10,"What you want for Christmas?!
"
,,
5,10,"I was thinking maybe
"
,,
5,10,"one of those old-timey...
"
,,
5,10,"Too late! Take too long!
"
,,
5,10,"Sad Christmas!
"
,,
5,10," What you want?!
"
,,
5,10," Fire truck!
"
,,
5,10," What color?!
"
,,
5,10," Red!
"
,,
5,10,"Next!
"
,,
5,10,"Peter, have you been drinking?
"
,,
5,10," Well, a little. It is a party.
"
,,
5,10," Take off that stupid costume!
"
,,
5,10,"You look like a damn fool.
"
,,
5,10,"Ah, Dad, you won't say that when
"
,,
5,10,"you see my grand unicycle finale.
"
,,
5,10,"Everyone, I'll be right back.
"
,,
5,10,"In the meantime, I leave you with
"
,,
5,10,"the musical stylings of Chris Griffin.
"
,,
5,10,"All right, this is gonna blow you guys...
"
,,
5,10," Grandpa!
"
,,
5,10," Oh, my God!
"
,,
5,10," Is he breathing?
"
,,
5,10," Somebody call an ambulance!
"
,,
5,10,"Uh, Lois, maybe you better
"
,,
5,10,"call two ambulances.
"
,,
5,10,"How is he, Doctor?
"
,,
5,10,"Mrs. Griffin, his internal injuries
"
,,
5,10,"were much too severe.
"
,,
5,10,"I'd estimate he'll be dead
"
,,
5,10,"within the hour.
"
,,
5,10,"Dad, I'm so sorry I broke all your ribs
"
,,
5,10,"and busted your spleen
"
,,
5,10,"and punctured your lung.
"
,,
5,10,"I don't if you can hear me right now, but
"
,,
5,10,"I hope you know...
"
,,
5,10,"I love you, Dad.
"
,,
5,10,"Peter...
"
,,
5,10,"come closer.
"
,,
5,10,"There's something...
"
,,
5,10,"I need to say to you.
"
,,
5,10,"I'm here, Dad. What is it?
"
,,
5,10,"Peter...
"
,,
5,10,"you're a fat, stinking drunk.
"
,,
5,10,"Oh, my God, he's dead. He can't be dead.
"
,,
5,10,"There's got to be something I can do.
"
,,
5,10,"Maybe I'll bury him in the pet cemetery.
"
,,
5,10,"Okay, I'll bury him in
"
,,
5,10,"a regular cemetery.
"
,,
5,10," I can't believe Grandpa's dead.
"
,,
5,10," Well, he did kind of treat us like crap,
"
,,
5,10," but, yes, it is a tragedy.
"
,,
5,10," It is a tragedy.
"
,,
5,10," Excuse us.
"
,,
5,10," Yeah, we'll be right back.
"
,,
5,10," We're all gonna miss him.
"
,,
5,10," Tragic.
"
,,
5,10,"You know what the worst part is?
"
,,
5,10,"All I wanted was for my dad
"
,,
5,10,"to tell me he loved me.
"
,,
5,10,"But instead, he called me a fat,
"
,,
5,10,"stinking drunk.
"
,,
5,10,"Those were his last words.
"
,,
5,10,"Well, I hate to side
"
,,
5,10,"with your father, Peter,
"
,,
5,10,"but you do kind of drink a lot, and,
"
,,
5,10,"you know, sometimes
"
,,
5,10,"it affects the people you love.
"
,,
5,10,"Oh, my God. Lois, you're right.
"
,,
5,10,"Booze made me fall down all those stairs.
"
,,
5,10,"Booze killed my father.
"
,,
5,10,"Well, from this day forward,
"
,,
5,10,"I, Peter Griffin,
"
,,
5,10,"will never drink again.
"
,,
5,10," Peter, what are you doing?
"
,,
5,10," Crack.
"
,,
5,10," What the fuck?!
"
,,
5,10," Hey, at least I'm not drinking, Brian.
"
,,
5,10,"This isn't exactly a good substitute.
"
,,
5,10,"Where'd you get crack?
"
,,
5,10," From blacks.
"
,,
5,10," What?
"
,,
5,10,"Right behind Black's Hardware Store.
"
,,
5,10,"There's a white guy selling it.
"
,,
5,10,"Doing crack is not the way
"
,,
5,10,"to stop drinking.
"
,,
5,10,"You need to get to the heart of why you
"
,,
5,10,"feel the need to drink in the first place.
"
,,
5,10,"Look, here, this is the number of
"
,,
5,10,"a hypnotherapist I want you to see.
"
,,
5,10," All right, Brian.
"
,,
5,10," Good.
"
,,
5,10,"Peter, just thought I'd check on you.
"
,,
5,10,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
5,10,"Gov'ment came and took my baby!
"
,,
5,10,"This is mine, and this is mine,
"
,,
5,10,"and that's mine, and this is mine.
"
,,
5,10,"Oh, what's this?
"
,,
5,10,"""Hot Monogamy,
"
,,
5,10,"the board game for failing marriages.""
"
,,
5,10,"""Dare card : Have her do a strip tease
"
,,
5,10,"and see how long
"
,,
5,10,"it takes you to get a bonner.""
"
,,
5,10,"What's a ""bonner""?
"
,,
5,10,"Stewie, what are you doing
"
,,
5,10,"with my jewelry box?
"
,,
5,10," You give that back to Mommy.
"
,,
5,10," No! Go to hell!
"
,,
5,10,"Stewie, I have had just about enough
"
,,
5,10,"of this new selfish attitude of yours.
"
,,
5,10," Now, give that back to Mommy!
"
,,
5,10," Very well, then.
"
,,
5,10," If I can't have it, nobody can!
"
,,
5,10," That is enough!
"
,,
5,10," You... you struck me!
"
,,
5,10," Oh, my God.
"
,,
5,10,"Stewie, honey, I am so sorry.
"
,,
5,10,"Are you okay, sweetie?
"
,,
5,10,"Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
"
,,
5,10,"Mommy would never hurt you.
"
,,
5,10," Let me give you a hug.
"
,,
5,10," No!
"
,,
5,10,"I haven't been this scared since
"
,,
5,10,"Mother Teresa OD'd in my car.
"
,,
5,10,"She is messed up, man!
"
,,
5,10,"Shut up! Just shut up!
"
,,
5,10,"Let me fucking think!
"
,,
5,10," Push her out.
"
,,
5,10," We can't leave her alone.
"
,,
5,10,"Push the bitch out!
"
,,
5,10,"Okay, now let's go back in
"
,,
5,10,"your mind to your childhood,
"
,,
5,10," to some of your deepest memories.
"
,,
5,10," Yeah, I'm getting something.
"
,,
5,10," Happy Father's Day, Dad.
"
,,
5,10," I'm not your father!
"
,,
5,10,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
5,10,"Francis Griffin wasn't my real father!
"
,,
5,10,"I wonder what else I've repressed.
"
,,
5,10,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
5,10,"I could've had a V8.
"
,,
5,10,"It was horrible, Rupert.
"
,,
5,10,"It was like a nightmare.
"
,,
5,10,"Lois came at me like a wild animal.
"
,,
5,10,"I had no way to defend myself.
"
,,
5,10,"Mother, I'm sorry I went
"
,,
5,10,"against your wishes.
"
,,
5,10,"I'm sorry I misbehaved, mother!
"
,,
5,10,"I'm sorry I misbehaved!
"
,,
5,10,"I love you, Mommy Dearest!
"
,,
5,10,"Oh, it was awful, Rupert.
"
,,
5,10,"I felt terrified and
"
,,
5,10,"brutalized and humiliated and... and...
"
,,
5,10,"and alive.
"
,,
5,10,"My God, I...
"
,,
5,10,"I haven't felt that alive in years.
"
,,
5,10,"Rupert, you know, I think perhaps
"
,,
5,10,"I may be one of those people who...
"
,,
5,10," gets a jolly out of being hit.
"
,,
5,10," Oh, Stewie, there you are.
"
,,
5,10,"Mommy is so sorry she hit you.
"
,,
5,10,"I promise I will never lay
"
,,
5,10,"a hand on you again.
"
,,
5,10,"Well, let's not make any rash decisions.
"
,,
5,10,"I mean, I did provoke you.
"
,,
5,10,"Come on, Lois, hit me! Beat the
"
,,
5,10,"crap out of me! Step on my cubes.
"
,,
5,10,"Oh, hi, Peter. Are you here
"
,,
5,10,"to bring back the TV set?
"
,,
5,10,"No, I sold it for crack. But listen,
"
,,
5,10,"Mom, I've got to ask you something.
"
,,
5,10,"Who's my real father?
"
,,
5,10,"I knew this day would come.
"
,,
5,10,"All right, Peter, here it is.
"
,,
5,10,"About 40 years ago,
"
,,
5,10,"I was vactioning in Ireland,
"
,,
5,10,"and I met a young rogue
"
,,
5,10,"named Mickey McFinnegan.
"
,,
5,10,"Peter, Mickey is your real father.
"
,,
5,10,"Oh my God! I gotta find him!
"
,,
5,10,"To Ireland!
"
,,
5,10," Sweetheart, when will you be back?
"
,,
5,10," I don't know, Lois.
"
,,
5,10,"All I know is somewhere
"
,,
5,10,"in the great land of Ireland,
"
,,
5,10,"is a big fat bastard who looks like me.
"
,,
5,10,"Call me as soon as you can, Peter. And
"
,,
5,10,"I really hope you find your real father.
"
,,
5,10," We're going to miss you, Dad.
"
,,
5,10," Come back soon, Daddy. I love you.
"
,,
5,10,"That'll do, pig. That'll do.
"
,,
5,10,"There she is, Rupert.
"
,,
5,10,"If I can just get her to
"
,,
5,10,"hit me one more time,
"
,,
5,10,"it'll give me the rush
"
,,
5,10,"I've been looking for!
"
,,
5,10,"What's next? What's next?
"
,,
5,10,"Oh, God, I've been so bloody naughty,
"
,,
5,10,"and I need to be taught a lesson
"
,,
5,10,"and you're the one to do it.
"
,,
5,10,"Oh! Thank you!
"
,,
5,10,"Thank you!
"
,,
5,10,"Yeah, all that stuff.
"
,,
5,10,"Let's make that happen.
"
,,
5,10," Hi, sweetie. You want some juice?
"
,,
5,10," Ooh, that'll be lovely.
"
,,
5,10," Oh, Stewie!
"
,,
5,10," Yeah?
"
,,
5,10," Look at the mess you made.
"
,,
5,10," I've made a terrible mess, haven't I?
"
,,
5,10,"Yes, I made you take time out
"
,,
5,10,"of your day to clean my mess
"
,,
5,10," and I should be punished for it. Go!
"
,,
5,10," Well, I guess it's not that big a deal.
"
,,
5,10," Accidents happen.
"
,,
5,10," I don't know.
"
,,
5,10,"Don't you think you should
"
,,
5,10,"spank me or slice my nostril?
"
,,
5,10," It's all right, Stewie. Now go play.
"
,,
5,10," All right.
"
,,
5,10,"Look! I've drawn heavy weight pugilist
"
,,
5,10,"David Tua on the wall.
"
,,
5,10," Punish me!
"
,,
5,10," Sweetie, you've really gotta stop...
"
,,
5,10,"huh, looks like David Tua...
"
,,
5,10,"You really got to stop misbehaving.
"
,,
5,10,"You're getting on Mommy's nerves.
"
,,
5,10,"Well, you know what'll ease your stress?
"
,,
5,10,"Slap me across the face like a bitch!
"
,,
5,10,"It's all right. I'll get some windex.
"
,,
5,10,"Come on! Discipline me!
"
,,
5,10,"Make me wear panties, rub dirt in my
"
,,
5,10,"eye, violating me with a wine bottle.
"
,,
5,10,"My God, I really do
"
,,
5,10,"have problems, don't I?
"
,,
5,10,"We'll be landing in five minutes.</i>
"
,,
5,10,"This is quite a country, Brian.
"
,,
5,10,"You know, Ireland has more
"
,,
5,10,"drunks per capita than people.
"
,,
5,10,"That's a negative stereotype.
"
,,
5,10,"I don't think the Irish drink
"
,,
5,10,"as much as people say they do.
"
,,
5,10,"Uh, excuse me?
"
,,
5,10,"Is this McSwiggen Village?
"
,,
5,10,"Ah, did ***** who say a word *****, hmm?
"
,,
5,10,"Is that a yes or a no?
"
,,
5,10,"Aye, tis McSwiggen Village. Where the
"
,,
5,10,"hills are green, the streams are clear,
"
,,
5,10,"and the sweaters are so thick,
"
,,
5,10,"even the boniest-fingered nun
"
,,
5,10,"could poke you in the chest
"
,,
5,10,"and it wouldn't bother you none.
"
,,
5,10,"Don't be so bold with your
"
,,
5,10,"dark hair and your proud ways!
"
,,
5,10,"I can't feel a thing!
"
,,
5,10,"You heard of a man
"
,,
5,10,"named Mickey McFinnegan?
"
,,
5,10,"Have I heard of him?
"
,,
5,10,"Of course I've heard of him!
"
,,
5,10," He's the town drunk.
"
,,
5,10," Town drunk?!
"
,,
5,10,"Oh, my God, you mean he's
"
,,
5,10,"the disgrace of the whole town?
"
,,
5,10,"You lads aren't from around here, are ya?
"
,,
5,10,"Top of the morning, ladies!
"
,,
5,10,"Let me cut you an Irish rose.
"
,,
5,10,"I don't know exactly
"
,,
5,10,"where the county Cork is
"
,,
5,10,"but I know where it should be!
"
,,
5,10,"Around here, the town drunk
"
,,
5,10,"is a person of great honor.
"
,,
5,10,"Excuse me, sir? My name is Peter.
"
,,
5,10,"Pleased to meet you, lad.
"
,,
5,10,"My name's Mickey.
"
,,
5,10,"Listen, uh, this maybe hard
"
,,
5,10,"for you to believe but...
"
,,
5,10," You're my father.
"
,,
5,10," Oh, am I now?
"
,,
5,10,"Yeah, I came all the way
"
,,
5,10,"from America to find you.
"
,,
5,10,"I suppose it's money you're wanted.
"
,,
5,10,"I owe you some allowance and so forth.
"
,,
5,10,"Oh, no, I don't want money. I just
"
,,
5,10,"want to get to know you and be friends.
"
,,
5,10,"So I can finally have a real dad
"
,,
5,10,"who loves and respects me.
"
,,
5,10,"You can't be me son.
"
,,
5,10,"You and me are nothing alike.
"
,,
5,10,"Just ask me sheep, O'Brian.
"
,,
5,10,"Who's leg do you have to hump
"
,,
5,10,"to get a pint of Guiness around here?
"
,,
5,10,"Boy it's amazing, isn't it?
"
,,
5,10,"You get two fathers
"
,,
5,10,"and neither one of them
"
,,
5,10,"wants anything to do with you.
"
,,
5,10,"There's got to be some way I can make
"
,,
5,10,"him see that I'm worthy of being his son.
"
,,
5,10,"About the only way I can ever impress
"
,,
5,10,"him is if I was a fat stinkin' drunk.
"
,,
5,10," What?
"
,,
5,10," You're a fat stinking drunk!
"
,,
5,10,"Yes, from was he told us.
"
,,
5,10,"That's right on the money.
"
,,
5,10," Challenge him, you must.
"
,,
5,10," And I'm Hayden Christensen.
"
,,
5,10,"Wait a minute, Brian, that's it!
"
,,
5,10,"I'm a fat stinkin' drunk
"
,,
5,10,"because my father is a fat stinkin'
"
,,
5,10,"drunk. I gotta prove it to him.
"
,,
5,10,"I have gotta drink him
"
,,
5,10,"so far under the table,
"
,,
5,10,"he'll have no choice but to respect me.
"
,,
5,10,"Get me a beer, Brian.
"
,,
5,10,"I am going to prepare
"
,,
5,10,"for this as thoroughly as
"
,,
5,10,"Ben Affleck prepares for a role.
"
,,
5,10,"Wow, I got to be Henry VIII
"
,,
5,10,"in twenty minutes!
"
,,
5,10,"Allo? Allo? Alloo? Alloo?
"
,,
5,10,"Got it!
"
,,
5,10,"Mickey McFinnegan,
"
,,
5,10,"I challenge you to a drinking contest.
"
,,
5,10,"And what makes you think you can
"
,,
5,10,"hold your own with the *likes* of me?
"
,,
5,10,"Because I'm your son. And I'm tough.
"
,,
5,10,"I mean it half way through
"
,,
5,10,"Failure to Launch.
"
,,
5,10,"I just never managed
"
,,
5,10,"to get my life together.
"
,,
5,10,"Isn't that hilarious?
"
,,
5,10,"You're cute.
"
,,
5,10,"Done!
"
,,
5,10,"As we say in Ireland,
"
,,
5,10,"Let's drink until the alcohol in our
"
,,
5,10,"system destroy ours livers and kills us.
"
,,
5,10," I've got twenty on the fat one.
"
,,
5,10," What happened?
"
,,
5,10," Peter, you won!
"
,,
5,10,"My God, nobody's ever beat me
"
,,
5,10,"at the game of drink.
"
,,
5,10,"Now do you believe that you're my dad?
"
,,
5,10,"Nobody but a McFinnegan could
"
,,
5,10,"handle that much of the creature.
"
,,
5,10,"You're the broth of me own
"
,,
5,10,"stubby shillelagh, all right.
"
,,
5,10," Welcome to me family, Peter.
"
,,
5,10," You hear that, Brian?
"
,,
5,10,"I'm a McFinnegan now!
"
,,
5,10,"I can forget all about Francis.
"
,,
5,10,"You know, there's something
"
,,
5,10,"you should always remember, Peter.
"
,,
5,10,"Francis may not have been your father,
"
,,
5,10,"but he raised you as if you
"
,,
5,10,"were his own. And if that isn't love,
"
,,
5,10," I don't know what is.
"
,,
5,10," Wow, I guess you're right.
"
,,
5,10,"But there is one thing, Mickey.
"
,,
5,10,"You knocked up my mom and
"
,,
5,10,"never called her again.
"
,,
5,10," Yeah, so what?
"
,,
5,10," So what?
"
,,
5,10,"So let's dance!
"
,,
5,10,"And he never taught me anything</i>
"
,,
5,10,"sing of my drunken Irish dad</i>
"
,,
5,10,"And he never shuts his freakin' trap</i>
"
,,
5,10,"from your drunken Irish dad</i>
"
,,
5,10,"they'll tell you the same</i>
"
,,
5,10,"Cotter and Clooney</i>
"
,,
5,10,"of pride and the shame</i>
"
,,
5,10,"their dad passes by</i>
"
,,
5,10,"And our moods infect us like a germ</i>
"
,,
5,10,"of a pickled sperm...</i>
"
,,
5,10,"And we don't tan well, either.

5,11,"Peter, are you sure you're allowed

5,11,"to bring a baby onto the golf course?
"
,,
5,11,"Well, Lois asked me to watch
"
,,
5,11,"Stewie for the afternoon.
"
,,
5,11,"It's all right, I don't think
"
,,
5,11,"the club will mind.
"
,,
5,11," It's Cleveland I'm worried about.
"
,,
5,11," Peter, is this really necessary?
"
,,
5,11," I can't hardly see anything.
"
,,
5,11," Hey, look, it's President Nixon.
"
,,
5,11,"No, wait, it's a black guy.
"
,,
5,11,"No, it's Nixon.
"

5,11,"Oh, boy, that was close.

5,11,"worth the trip, not by a long shot.
"

5,11,"Oh, I got to get that.
"

5,11,"I'll talk to you later.
"

5,11," Hey, uh, Joe...
"

5,11," Don't say it, Peter.
"

5,11," I was just wondering...
"

5,11,"about his anger issues with this game?

5,11,"A white man shouldn't play sports
"

5,11,"in the first place.
"
,,
5,11,"Hey, hey, that's a stroke!
"
,,
5,11,"I just tapped my ball, Quagmire. Relax.
"
,,
5,11,"Oh, relax? Oh, okay.
"
,,
5,11,"Look, I just tapped my ball.
"
,,
5,11,"Just tapped it again.
"
,,
5,11,"Tap, tap, tap.
"
,,
5,11,"Where is it? Oh! It's in the hole.
"
,,
5,11,"Eagle.
"
,,
5,11,"Yay, Quagmire.
"
,,
5,11,"Hey, Quagmire, you know it's
"
,,
5,11,"not fun when you're like this.
"
,,
5,11,"You want fun? Go home and buy a monkey.
"
,,
5,11," What does that even mean?
"
,,
5,11," I don't know.
"
,,
5,11,"Boy, we've got a beautiful day for this.
"
,,
5,11,"Hi, Mr. Herbert. Here's your paper.
"
,,
5,11,"Sorry, Chris, but I'm afraid I'm going
"
,,
5,11,"to have to cancel my subscription.
"
,,
5,11,"Cancel? But you love this paper.
"
,,
5,11,"Listen, I think you're a real nice guy,
"
,,
5,11,"but I've just decided
"
,,
5,11,"to go with another paper.
"
,,
5,11,"Hello, there, Kyle. You look nice today.
"
,,
5,11,"I see you're wearing your big shorts
"
,,
5,11,"with the baggy leg holes that flutter
"
,,
5,11," so carelessly in the breeze.
"
,,
5,11," Here's your paper.
"
,,
5,11,"What are you doing here?
"
,,
5,11,"Beat it, nerd.
"
,,
5,11,"Thank you.
"
,,
5,11,"Would you like to come inside
"
,,
5,11,"for a cupcake and a glass of wine?
"
,,
5,11,"Shut up, old man.
"
,,
5,11,"What's going on in my pants?
"
,,
5,11,"Looks like we got six
"
,,
5,11,"more weeks of winter.
"
,,
5,11,"Cutting in Line in Front of Italians.</i>
"
,,
5,11,"Hey, Copernicus, why don't you navigate
"
,,
5,11,"yourself to the back of the line
"
,,
5,11,"with your feet and
"
,,
5,11,"stand there with your shirt?
"
,,
5,11,"Hey, Peter, how was your golf game?
"
,,
5,11,"Well, Lois, you tied my golf shoes
"
,,
5,11,"a little tight before I left the house.
"
,,
5,11,"Had to deal with that all day.
"
,,
5,11,"Thank you very much.
"
,,
5,11,"Oh, my God, look at Stewie!
"
,,
5,11,"Peter, you took him out
"
,,
5,11,"without any sunscreen?
"
,,
5,11,"Maybe.
"
,,
5,11,"You know the sun is dangerous
"
,,
5,11,"for a baby's skin.
"
,,
5,11,"Peter, this is more irresponsible
"
,,
5,11,"than when you fed your
"
,,
5,11,"mogwai after midnight.
"
,,
5,11,"Peter, didn't the little Chinese man
"
,,
5,11,"tell you not to feed him after midnight?
"
,,
5,11,"Come on, Lois, he's so cute.
"
,,
5,11,"And he's hungry. What could happen?
"
,,
5,11,"Hello, I'm Fran Drescher.
"
,,
5,11,"Kill it! Kill it!
"
,,
5,11,"What the deuce are you all staring at?
"
,,
5,11,"Is there something wrong with me?
"
,,
5,11,"Wow, look at me.
"
,,
5,11,"I'm a young Eartha Kitt.
"
,,
5,11,"""President Johnson, bring our boys
"
,,
5,11,"home from Southeast Asia.
"
,,
5,11,"It's an unwinnable war...""
"
,,
5,11,"Dad, I was wondering
"
,,
5,11,"if I could borrow $17.
"
,,
5,11,"Chris, what do you need money for?
"
,,
5,11,"Isn't that why you have a paper route?
"
,,
5,11,"No, this new kid named Kyle
"
,,
5,11,"keeps stealing all my customers.
"
,,
5,11,"Oh, that's terrible. You're a
"
,,
5,11,"wonderful paperboy, Chris,
"
,,
5,11,"and you need to remind
"
,,
5,11,"your customers of that.
"
,,
5,11,"She's right, you got to
"
,,
5,11,"stand up for yourself.
"
,,
5,11,"Like my great-grandfather, Turn-Of

,,
5,11,"The-Century-Take-On-All-Comers Griffin.

,,
5,11,"All right, put 'em up, put 'em up.
"
,,
5,11,"Are you having a bully day?
"
,,
5,11,"I'm having a bully day.
"
,,
5,11,"Is everyone having a bully day?
"
,,
5,11," Bully.
"
,,
5,11," Bully.
"
,,
5,11," Yes, Bully.
"
,,
5,11,"Oh, thank God we live in this time.
"
,,
5,11," Stewie, what are you doing?
"
,,
5,11," Just getting my bronze on, baby.
"
,,
5,11,"Hey, what do you think
"
,,
5,11,"of my recumbent tan pose?
"
,,
5,11,"Legs probably spread a little wider
"
,,
5,11,"than they ought to be, but
"
,,
5,11,"who gives a damn? This is
"
,,
5,11,"just tan Stewie being tan Stewie.
"
,,
5,11,"Check me out, Brian.
"
,,
5,11,"Hey, Mr. Herbert, I want you back.
"
,,
5,11,"Please, will you be
"
,,
5,11,"my paper customer again?
"
,,
5,11,"Oh, uh, hey, Chris.
"
,,
5,11,"Oh, is that my phone?
"
,,
5,11," Oh, better go get that.
"
,,
5,11," Well, if it isn't King Lardass.
"
,,
5,11," Don't call me names, Kyle.
"
,,
5,11," Hi, Kyle.
"
,,
5,11,"Well, listen, it was wrong of you
"
,,
5,11,"to steal my customer away from me.
"
,,
5,11," And I want him back.
"
,,
5,11," Oh, yeah?
"
,,
5,11," Look, Griffin got his ass kicked.
"
,,
5,11," What a loser.
"
,,
5,11,"I have that shirt at home.
"
,,
5,11,"You... you pushed me.
"
,,
5,11,"Boys, boys, we can settle this like
"
,,
5,11,"reasonable and sexy teenagers.
"
,,
5,11,"Whoever can swallow
"
,,
5,11,"the most Tylenol PM wins.
"
,,
5,11," Oh, my God, Chris, what happened?!
"
,,
5,11," Kyle beat me up.
"
,,
5,11," You let that little punk beat you up?
"
,,
5,11," Peter, you should be more sympathetic.
"
,,
5,11,"Remember, you had a bully, too,
"
,,
5,11,"when you were his age.
"
,,
5,11,"Yeah, you're right. Randy Fulcher
"
,,
5,11,"used to pants me every chance he got.
"
,,
5,11,"My book report is on The Giving Tree.
"
,,
5,11,"Nerd!
"
,,
5,11,"Randy!
"
,,
5,11,"Nerd!
"
,,
5,11,"Randy!
"
,,
5,11," Nerd!
"
,,
5,11," Randy!
"
,,
5,11,"Peter, I think one of us should go over
"
,,
5,11,"and have a talk with Kyle's parents.
"
,,
5,11,"I'll do it, Lois. Right after
"
,,
5,11,"a healthy breakfast of juice,
"
,,
5,11,"toast and store brand imitation frosted
"
,,
5,11,"flakes featuring Terry the Tiger.
"
,,
5,11,"They'rrrre... food.
"
,,
5,11,"Hey, ladies, you mind if I park here?
"
,,
5,11,"I'll only be a few minutes.
"
,,
5,11," Stewie, what is that on your lip?
"
,,
5,11," I drew a pencil mustache.
"
,,
5,11,"I like it 'cause it's just above my lip.
"
,,
5,11,"The kind of mustache that says, ""Yeah,
"
,,
5,11,"I've been nude on camera. What of it?""
"
,,
5,11,"Come here, I'll take care
"
,,
5,11,"of that, sweetie.
"
,,
5,11,"Ew, ew, it's got spit all over it.
"
,,
5,11,"Now I know what it feels like to
"
,,
5,11,"have dinner with Martin Landau.
"
,,
5,11,"What people forget about Polanski is
"
,,
5,11,"Polanski wasn't a perfectionist.
"
,,
5,11,"And pedophile or not, he,
"
,,
5,11,"he was a perfectly professional person.
"
,,
5,11,"And punctual.
"
,,
5,11,"Yeah, maybe we could talk
"
,,
5,11,"about something else?
"
,,
5,11,"You know my wife and I are very
"
,,
5,11,"involved in Planned Parenthood.
"
,,
5,11,"Which provides possibilities for
"
,,
5,11,"people who are underprivileged.
"
,,
5,11,"Maybe chew your food a little, champ.
"
,,
5,11,"Who are all these people?
"
,,
5,11,"Oh, just a few friends over to
"
,,
5,11,"enjoy this gorgeous weather,
"
,,
5,11,"and maybe take a dip in the pool.
"
,,
5,11,"Hey, Devon, Devon, come here.
"
,,
5,11,"Brian, this is Devon.
"
,,
5,11,"Devon just finished directing a movie.
"
,,
5,11,"Yeah, it, uh, stars a little actress
"
,,
5,11,"named Joan Van Ark.
"
,,
5,11,"Maybe you've heard of her.
"
,,
5,11," Right. Possibly.
"
,,
5,11," You're talking out of your ass.
"
,,
5,11,"It doesn't matter, Brian, I'm tan.
"
,,
5,11,"Hey, Brian, Brian, Brian,
"
,,
5,11,"look at my tan walk.
"
,,
5,11," Devon, do you have a cigarette?
"
,,
5,11," Sure.
"
,,
5,11,"And here's a copy of my last movie.
"
,,
5,11,"It's essentially Brokeback Mountain
"
,,
5,11,"from the point of view of the horses.
"
,,
5,11,"Hey, the sun's been up for an hour.
"
,,
5,11,"Shouldn't we get riding?
"
,,
5,11," Uh, are they still sleeping?
"
,,
5,11," I don't know. I'll check.
"
,,
5,11," Hey, there. Are you Kyle's parents?
"
,,
5,11," Yes. Can we help you?
"
,,
5,11,"Yeah, I'm Peter Griffin.
"
,,
5,11,"Listen, apparently your son got
"
,,
5,11,"into a little scrape with my kid.
"
,,
5,11," Oh, dear, they're not getting along?
"
,,
5,11," Like an old guy and a midget.
"
,,
5,11,"Sir, will you please stop staring at me?
"
,,
5,11,"Where's the rest of ya?
"
,,
5,11,"So, listen, Chris is pretty upset
"
,,
5,11,"about what happened.
"
,,
5,11,"Would you mind if I had
"
,,
5,11,"a word with your son?
"
,,
5,11,"Not at all. He's up in his room.
"
,,
5,11,"Hey, there. Kyle?
"
,,
5,11," Hey, I'm Chris Griffin's father.
"
,,
5,11," Hey, I'm Chris Griffin's father.
"
,,
5,11,"That's not very nice.
"
,,
5,11,"I don't sound like that at all.
"
,,
5,11,"You're making me sound
"
,,
5,11,"like Michael Stipe.
"
,,
5,11,"Listen, I just want you to know what
"
,,
5,11,"you did the other day was wrong.
"
,,
5,11," What you did the other day was wrong.
"
,,
5,11," You're not making this easy, Kyle.
"
,,
5,11,"You're not making this easy, Kyle.
"
,,
5,11,"My name's Peter Griffin.
"
,,
5,11,"I'm a big, fat, dumb butt-face.
"
,,
5,11," Shut up, Kyle.
"
,,
5,11," I'm Peter Griffin.
"
,,
5,11," I'm a dorky, fat, numbnuts.
"
,,
5,11," Kyle, I said shut up.
"
,,
5,11,"You're a poop-nose.
"
,,
5,11," Hey, Peter.
"
,,
5,11," Hey, what's going on?
"
,,
5,11," Is something wrong?
"
,,
5,11," No, no.
"
,,
5,11,"Everything's cool right now.
"
,,
5,11,"Might be some problems later, but we'll
"
,,
5,11,"cross that bridge when we come to it.
"
,,
5,11," Well, I'd best be getting to work.
"
,,
5,11," It's nighttime.
"
,,
5,11,"Boy, you said it.
"
,,
5,11,"All right, take it easy.
"
,,
5,11,"Peter, you get down from
"
,,
5,11,"that tree this instant!
"
,,
5,11,"No! You're gonna yell at me!
"
,,
5,11,"You're damn right I'm gonna yell at you.
"
,,
5,11,"You beat up a 13-year-old boy!
"
,,
5,11,"He called me names!
"
,,
5,11,"You're 43, and you just assaulted
"
,,
5,11,"our neighbor's child!
"
,,
5,11,"This is a very serious situation.
"
,,
5,11,"Well, maybe you should have
"
,,
5,11,"just had an abortion, Lois!
"
,,
5,11,"Would that make you happy
"
,,
5,11,"if I was never born?!
"
,,
5,11,"What?
"
,,
5,11,"I'm going to prison, aren't I?
"
,,
5,11," What are you doing?
"
,,
5,11," Got to keep the tan up.
"
,,
5,11,"It's not a skin color,
"
,,
5,11,"it's a lifestyle, Brian.
"
,,
5,11,"See, you wouldn't know that
"
,,
5,11,"because you're white as a ghost.
"
,,
5,11,"You're haunting this house
"
,,
5,11,"with your whiteness, Brian.
"
,,
5,11,"Hey, wake me up in 15, will ya, babe?
"
,,
5,11,"Fine.
"
,,
5,11,"Stewie takes it slow...</i>
"
,,
5,11,"Oh, crap! Stewie!
"
,,
5,11,"Uh, hey, buddy. I was just coming
"
,,
5,11,"to tell ya it's time to get out.
"
,,
5,11,"I've been in there for six and
"
,,
5,11,"a half hours, you son of a bitch!
"
,,
5,11," Don't touch me!
"
,,
5,11," Well, how, how...?
"
,,
5,11," Can, can you get up?
"
,,
5,11," I'll try.
"
,,
5,11,"I can't do it! I can't do it!
"
,,
5,11,"Get the lotion! Put the lotion on me!
"
,,
5,11," Brian!
"
,,
5,11," Oh, uh, hi, Mr. Furley.
"
,,
5,11,"Never mind! I'll come back later!
"
,,
5,11,"Now be polite, Peter.
"
,,
5,11,"Kyle's mother agreed not to
"
,,
5,11,"press charges if you apologize.
"
,,
5,11," Hello, Lois.
"
,,
5,11," Hello, Claire.
"
,,
5,11,"We just came by
"
,,
5,11,"because there's something
"
,,
5,11,"Peter would like to say to Kyle.
"
,,
5,11," Go on.
"
,,
5,11," Slorry.
"
,,
5,11," Say it right, Peter.
"
,,
5,11," Ow! Ow! Sorry!
"
,,
5,11,"Thank you, Peter.
"
,,
5,11,"Now what do you say, Kyle?
"
,,
5,11," Apology accepted.
"
,,
5,11," Good.
"
,,
5,11,"Now why don't you patch things up with
"
,,
5,11,"Mr. Griffin by showing him your Legos?
"
,,
5,11,"You got Legos? Aw, sweet!
"
,,
5,11," Lois only buys me Mega Bloks.
"
,,
5,11," They're the same thing, Peter.
"
,,
5,11,"You know what, Lois?
"
,,
5,11,"They are not the same thing.
"
,,
5,11,"And the sooner you get that
"
,,
5,11,"through your thick skull,
"
,,
5,11,"the sooner we can get
"
,,
5,11,"this marriage back on track.
"
,,
5,11,"Hey, listen, uh,
"
,,
5,11,"sorry about beating you up.
"
,,
5,11,"I felt pretty bad about it.
"
,,
5,11,"Hey, this look like a spaceship to you?
"
,,
5,11,"Sorta.
"
,,
5,11,"Well, I never was very good
"
,,
5,11,"at building things.
"
,,
5,11,"Like that time I built that
"
,,
5,11,"handmade electric razor.
"
,,
5,11,"By gluing many razor blades
"
,,
5,11,"to this ordinary desk fan,
"
,,
5,11,"I'll save time in my morning routine.
"
,,
5,11,"Lois, I done it again.
"
,,
5,11,"You don't have to apologize.
"
,,
5,11,"I would have done the same thing.
"
,,
5,11,"I mean, bullying makes
"
,,
5,11,"you feel pretty cool.
"
,,
5,11,"Yeah, guess it was kinda cool.
"
,,
5,11,"You know, I always used to be
"
,,
5,11,"the nerd getting bullied, but
"
,,
5,11,"doing it to someone else
"
,,
5,11,"was pretty sweet.
"
,,
5,11,"And the more you do it,
"
,,
5,11,"the sweeter it gets.
"
,,
5,11,"Cook much?
"
,,
5,11,"Peter, what the hell is wrong with you?!
"
,,
5,11,"What's wrong with me? You're the
"
,,
5,11,"one punching yourself in the face.
"
,,
5,11,"Hey, Lois, how come you keep
"
,,
5,11,"punching yourself in the face?
"
,,
5,11," Knock it off!
"
,,
5,11," You're gonna hurt yourself.
"
,,
5,11," Ha! You're getting her good!
"
,,
5,11," Hey, Stewie, nice sunburn.
"
,,
5,11,"God, you horse's ass!
"
,,
5,11,"Hey, Brian, you want some Stewie jerky?
"
,,
5,11," Oh, God, that is disgusting.
"
,,
5,11," I'm finally starting to peel.
"
,,
5,11,"I'm telling you, Brian,
"
,,
5,11,"my tanning days are over.
"
,,
5,11,"I'm just glad I stopped before I
"
,,
5,11,"did any real damage to my skin.
"
,,
5,11,"I wouldn't be so sure.
"
,,
5,11,"I don't remember you having
"
,,
5,11,"that mole before.
"
,,
5,11,"What the devil?
"
,,
5,11,"Where did that come from?
"
,,
5,11," Brian, what is that?
"
,,
5,11," I don't know.
"
,,
5,11,"Of course, your sunburn was
"
,,
5,11,"pretty bad. I suppose it could be...
"
,,
5,11,"the ""C"" word.
"
,,
5,11,"What the hell does that
"
,,
5,11,"have to do with anything?
"
,,
5,11,"No, cancer.
"
,,
5,11,"I-I thought you meant...
"
,,
5,11,"It's not important...
"
,,
5,11,"Oh, no!
"
,,
5,11,"Cancer!
"
,,
5,11,"Well, the mole looks benign,
"
,,
5,11,"but we won't know for sure
"
,,
5,11,"whether it's cancerous until the
"
,,
5,11,"tests come back in a few days.
"
,,
5,11,"A few days?!
"
,,
5,11," I could be dead by then!
"
,,
5,11," Relax, Stewie.
"
,,
5,11,"He said it looks benign.
"
,,
5,11,"We'll just have to wait and see.
"
,,
5,11,"Jim Henson had a wait-and-see attitude
"
,,
5,11,"and look what happened to him.
"
,,
5,11,"Now we've got wrong-sounding Muppets!
"
,,
5,11," Hey, Swedish chef.
"
,,
5,11," Oh, hey, Kermit, what's going on?
"
,,
5,11,"I'm hungry.
"
,,
5,11,"Oh, that's no problem. I could cook
"
,,
5,11,"you something. You want some spaghetti?
"
,,
5,11,"That's, like, my specialty and junk.
"
,,
5,11,"Dad, what's wrong with you?!
"
,,
5,11,"Why are you acting like such a bully?
"
,,
5,11,"'Cause there are two kinds of

,,
5,11,"people in this world, Chris.
"
,,
5,11,"There are bullies and there are nerds.
"
,,
5,11,"And there are hot Asian chicks.
"
,,
5,11,"They'll do what you want. Oh, yeah.
"
,,
5,11,"Oh, yeah. You better believe it, buddy.
"
,,
5,11,"They will do what you want
"
,,
5,11,"because they know,
"
,,
5,11,"they know what you want.
"
,,
5,11,"Oh, oh, oh, don't be afraid.
"
,,
5,11,"Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you.
"
,,
5,11,"I won't hurt you.
"
,,
5,11,"Me big American man.
"
,,
5,11,"My point being that I'm a bully,
"
,,
5,11,"not a nerd.
"
,,
5,11,"Now, where was I? Oh, yeah.
"
,,
5,11,"Dad, get away from me!
"
,,
5,11,"Oh, in the kitchen, Meg?
"
,,
5,11,"Brian, I may only have one week to live
"
,,
5,11,"and I've got to make the most of it.
"
,,
5,11,"Now, I've made a list of things
"
,,
5,11,"I want to do before I die
"
,,
5,11,"and you've got to help me
"
,,
5,11,"since this is all your fault.
"
,,
5,11,"""Visit Chicago Museum of Art.""
"
,,
5,11,"Okay, we can do that.
"
,,
5,11,"Next on your list, you want
"
,,
5,11,"to learn to ballroom dance.
"
,,
5,11,"All right, if you're gonna make
"
,,
5,11,"me do this, at least let me lead.
"
,,
5,11," Fine, you lead.
"
,,
5,11," All right, then.
"
,,
5,11,"I love you.
"
,,
5,11," What? What'd you say? 
"
,,
5,11," Uh, olive juice.
"
,,
5,11," Olive juice?
"
,,
5,11," Olive juice you, too.
"
,,
5,11,"Hey, you nerds wanna see a puppet show?
"
,,
5,11," Peter, put me down!
"
,,
5,11," I told you, not until you sing.
"
,,
5,11,"da-lay-hee-hoo!</i>
"
,,
5,11,"Dad, what are you doing to Mr. Swanson?
"
,,
5,11,"Peter, put him down right now!
"
,,
5,11," Beat it, Lois.
"
,,
5,11," Peter, stop it!
"
,,
5,11," Joe is your friend.
"
,,
5,11," Shut up, ya nerd!
"
,,
5,11,"Peter, look at yourself.
"
,,
5,11,"You are no different than that
"
,,
5,11,"bully who used to pick on you.
"
,,
5,11,"Are you kidding?
"
,,
5,11,"I'm nothing like Randy Fulcher.
"
,,
5,11,"Oh, no? Does that look familiar?
"
,,
5,11,"Oh, my God, you're right, Lois.
"
,,
5,11,"I shouldn't be bullying
"
,,
5,11,"the people I care about.
"
,,
5,11,"I should be bullying Randy Fulcher!
"
,,
5,11,"He's the jerk in all this.
"
,,
5,11,"Like Dick Cheney when he was
"
,,
5,11,"a Wal-Mart greeter.
"
,,
5,11,"Go fuck yourself.
"
,,
5,11,"Go fuck yourself.
"
,,
5,11,"Go fuck yourself.
"
,,
5,11," Well, that's it for the list.
"
,,
5,11," Not quite, Brian.
"
,,
5,11,"There's one more thing
"
,,
5,11,"I need you to do before I die.
"
,,
5,11," Write down my final thoughts.
"
,,
5,11," Oh, come on!
"
,,
5,11,"I don't have much time!
"
,,
5,11,"Oh, squiggly line in my eye fluid,
"
,,
5,11,"I see you there lurking on
"
,,
5,11,"the periphery of my vision,
"
,,
5,11,"but when I try to look at you,
"
,,
5,11,"you scurry away.
"
,,
5,11,"Are you shy, squiggly line?
"
,,
5,11,"Why only when I ignore you do
"
,,
5,11,"you return to the center of my eye?
"
,,
5,11,"Oh, squiggly line, it's all right.
"
,,
5,11,"You are forgiven.
"
,,
5,11,"Hello. Oh, hi, Dr. Hartman.
"
,,
5,11,"All right, I'll tell him. Thanks. Bye.
"
,,
5,11,"You don't have cancer.
"
,,
5,11,"You're gonna be fine.
"
,,
5,11,"Really?! Oh, thank God! Oh, thank God!
"
,,
5,11,"Wait, wait. Look, there's no reason
"
,,
5,11,"we can't finish the memoir anyway.
"
,,
5,11,"Let's see what you've got so far.
"
,,
5,11,"Oh, you are just the
"
,,
5,11,"worst type of person.
"
,,
5,11,"Dad, what are we doing here?
"
,,
5,11,"Chris, I'm gonna show you
"
,,
5,11,"how to stand up to a bully.
"
,,
5,11,"Hey, Fulcher!
"
,,
5,11,"Griffin?
"
,,
5,11," The feeling's mutual.
"
,,
5,11," What are you doing here?
"
,,
5,11,"I'm here to kick your ass, Fulcher.
"
,,
5,11,"I'm gonna beat ya, and then
"
,,
5,11,"my son Chris is gonna beat ya.
"
,,
5,11,"It's gonna be an old-fashioned
"
,,
5,11,"father-son beat-off.
"
,,
5,11,"Wait a minute, Dad. You can't hit him!
"
,,
5,11," Yeah, I have MS.
"
,,
5,11," Oh, you hear that, Chris?
"
,,
5,11,"This guy's got a monkey scrotum
"
,,
5,11,"and he's bragging about it.
"
,,
5,11,"Now you really got me mad.
"
,,
5,11,"No, Dad!
"
,,
5,11,"Sorry I had to do that, Dad.
"
,,
5,11,"But you wanted me to
"
,,
5,11,"learn to stand up to a bully.
"
,,
5,11,"Well, I'm standing up to you.
"
,,
5,11,"Stop bullying people, Dad!
"
,,
5,11,"My God, Chris, you're right.
"
,,
5,11,"Look at me. Look what I've become.
"
,,
5,11,"I thought it'd feel good
"
,,
5,11,"to be a bully, but
"
,,
5,11,"all I did was make people feel
"
,,
5,11,"as bad as Randy made me feel.
"
,,
5,11," I'm just a big jackass.
"
,,
5,11," It's all right, Dad. I forgive you.
"
,,
5,11,"As long as you promise never
"
,,
5,11,"to bully anyone again.
"
,,
5,11,"I promise, Chris.
"
,,
5,11,"I mean, you know,
"
,,
5,11,"unless I get really stinkin' drunk,
"
,,
5,11,"in which case all you got to do
"
,,
5,11,"is outrun your sister.
"
,,
5,11,"Oh, I like that. That's nice.
"
,,
5,11,"That's a warm family moment.
"
,,
5,11,"I agree. We can all learn
"
,,
5,11,"something from that.
"
,,
5,11,"Wocka, wocka...

"
,,
5,12,"Featuring...
"
,,
5,12,"You know you're a redneck if you come
"
,,
5,12,"from a rural area and behave as such.
"
,,
5,12,"Oh, that dog of mine!
"
,,
5,12,"You tell me how that got in there!
"
,,
5,12,"He's right.
"
,,
5,12,"Who knows how that got in there?
"
,,
5,12,"Peter, can we please go now?
"
,,
5,12,"This is excruciating.
"
,,
5,12,"Are you kidding, Brian?
"
,,
5,12,"These men and their redneck
"
,,
5,12,"lifestyle really speak to me.
"
,,
5,12,"This is the greatest show
"
,,
5,12,"I've seen in years.
"
,,
5,12,"Not like the last time
"
,,
5,12,"I was at a comedy club.
"
,,
5,12,"I hear this guy's hilarious.
"
,,
5,12,"He played Kramer, you know.
"
,,
5,12,"Oh, this is gonna be fun!
"
,,
5,12,"Peter... what the hell are you
"
,,
5,12,"doing with a pickup truck?
"
,,
5,12,"Wait. Let me guess.
"
,,
5,12,"This is because of the Redneck
"
,,
5,12,"Comedy Festival, isn't it?
"
,,
5,12,"Oh, that dog of mine.
"
,,
5,12,"Peter, you can't suddenly decide to be
"
,,
5,12,"a redneck just because of some show.
"
,,
5,12,"Some show?
"
,,
5,12,"Lois, those men showed me
"
,,
5,12,"the way to an identity
"
,,
5,12,"I've been searching for my whole life.
"
,,
5,12,"I am going to do everything
"
,,
5,12,"a redneck is supposed to do.
"
,,
5,12,"This is going to be more painful to watch
"
,,
5,12,"than when he ate
"
,,
5,12,"half a Fudgesicle in one bite.
"
,,
5,12,"Oh, boy! A Fudgesicle!
"
,,
5,12,"Chris, what happened to the couch?
"
,,
5,12,"Dad dragged it out on the lawn,
"
,,
5,12,"'cause he said
"
,,
5,12,"that's what rednecks do.
"
,,
5,12,"Hey, Meg, come here. Have a seat.
"
,,
5,12,"Dad, what are you doing?
"
,,
5,12,"Meg, I'm a redneck,
"
,,
5,12,"which means I am about
"
,,
5,12,"to do something to you
"
,,
5,12,"that you will not remember
"
,,
5,12,"until you're 40.
"
,,
5,12,"Meg, come back here!
"
,,
5,12,"I meant sex!
"
,,
5,12,"I'm Carl Sagan.
"
,,
5,12,"Just how old is our planet?
"
,,
5,12,"Scientists believe it's four bil...
"
,,
5,12,"Scientists have determined that
"
,,
5,12,"the universe was created by...
"
,,
5,12,"...big bang.
"
,,
5,12," If you look at the bones of a...
"
,,
5,12,"...aurus Rex, it's clear, by the
"
,,
5,12,"use of carbon-dating that...
"
,,
5,12," Peter, do we have to watch this?
"
,,
5,12," This is what rednecks watch, Brian.
"
,,
5,12,"Peter, that's disgusting.
"
,,
5,12,"Here. Spit in this cup instead.
"
,,
5,12,"Oh, there's my apple juice.
"
,,
5,12,"Stewie, wait. Don't...
"
,,
5,12,"Where's my money?
"
,,
5,12,"You going to give me my money?
"
,,
5,12,"Never mind.
"
,,
5,12,"Hey, Brian, check it out!
"
,,
5,12,"Peter, you painted over the back window.
"
,,
5,12,"Isn't that dangerous?
"
,,
5,12,"I'm a redneck, Brian.
"
,,
5,12,"We like people driving behind us
"
,,
5,12,"to know what our beliefs are.
"
,,
5,12,"Peter, what the hell?! My car!
"
,,
5,12,"Aw, damn it!
"
,,
5,12,"Hey! Hey, come back!
"
,,
5,12,"Oh, sorry, Quagmire.
"
,,
5,12,"How the hell am I supposed
"
,,
5,12,"to get to the airport?!
"
,,
5,12,"I got to fly a plane in 20 minutes.
"
,,
5,12,"Oh, I can drive you.
"
,,
5,12,"I got a pickup truck. See?
"
,,
5,12,"Well, come on!
"
,,
5,12," Quagmire, I am so sorry.
"
,,
5,12," Don't worry about it.
"
,,
5,12," We can go after them.
"
,,
5,12," Don't worry about it.
"
,,
5,12,"They're tagged! They're tagged!
"
,,
5,12,"Just get me to the airport.
"
,,
5,12,"All right. Thanks a lot, Peter.
"
,,
5,12,"That's all the motivation
"
,,
5,12,"I need to actually do this.
"
,,
5,12,"Did we finish fueling?
"
,,
5,12,"Do you see the hose in the plane?
"
,,
5,12,"No.
"
,,
5,12,"Well, then, I guess we're finished.
"
,,
5,12,"Thanks, George. You want to say that
"
,,
5,12,"one more time without the sarcasm?
"
,,
5,12,"This is your captain, Glenn Quagmire.</i>
"
,,
5,12,"four-and-a-half-hour flight time today.</i>
"
,,
5,12,"little longer than we've expected.</i>

"
,,
5,12,"please prepare for takeoff.</i>
"
,,
5,12,"What the hell?!
"
,,
5,12,"Oh, my God! We're going down!
"
,,
5,12,"Secure your own mask first,
"
,,
5,12,"and then assist the child!
"
,,
5,12," But the bag's not inflating!
"
,,
5,12," It's all right!
"
,,
5,12,"Even though oxygen is flowing,
"
,,
5,12,"the bag may not inflate!
"
,,
5,12,"That was too close.
"
,,
5,12,"Sir, we have a confirmed crash.
"
,,
5,12,"Flight 37 is down.
"
,,
5,12,"We'd better alert the mayor.

5,12,"I'll have to interrupt his photo op.

"
,,
5,12,"Our top story : There was drama
"
,,
5,12,"in the skies of Quahog today,
"
,,
5,12,"as a Trans National 767 was
"
,,
5,12,"forced to make a crash-landing.
"
,,
5,12,"That's right, Diane. As if the world
"
,,
5,12,"weren't already scary enough,
"
,,
5,12,"it seems you can't even get
"
,,
5,12,"on a plane safely these days.
"
,,
5,12,"Channel 5 has the spectacular footage.
"
,,
5,12,"Fortunately, no one was injured.
"
,,
5,12,"However, using state-of-the-art
"
,,
5,12,"Channel 5 computer technology,
"
,,
5,12,"we'll show you how disastrous
"
,,
5,12,"it could have been.
"
,,
5,12,"Here's how it would have looked if
"
,,
5,12,"the plane had crashed into a school.
"
,,
5,12,"Now here's how it would've
"
,,
5,12,"looked if the plane had crashed
"
,,
5,12,"into a school for bunnies.
"
,,
5,12,"Now here's how it would've
"
,,
5,12,"looked if the plane had crashed
"
,,
5,12,"into a school for bunnies
"
,,
5,12,"but one passenger had survived,
"
,,
5,12,"gone home, and mercilessly beat his wife.
"
,,
5,12,"I'm alive!
"
,,
5,12,"But boy, am I angry!
"
,,
5,12,"Someone's gonna have to pay for this!
"
,,
5,12,"Why! Why!
"
,,
5,12,"Is this because
"
,,
5,12,"I overcooked the roast?!
"
,,
5,12,"Powerful stuff.
"
,,
5,12,"You'd have to be made of stone
"
,,
5,12,"not to feel saddened by that.
"
,,
5,12,"Boy, Quagmire,
"
,,
5,12,"I'm really sorry they fired you.
"
,,
5,12,"I feel like this is partially my fault.
"
,,
5,12,"No, Peter, it's perfectly normal to
"
,,
5,12,"siphon jet fuel from an active runway
"
,,
5,12,"with the intention of
"
,,
5,12,"flying a pickup truck.
"
,,
5,12,"Look, I know I caused a lot of trouble,
"
,,
5,12,"but my redneck days are over.
"
,,
5,12,"No more crotch shots of me
"
,,
5,12,"getting out of a car.
"
,,
5,12,"Well, what are you
"
,,
5,12,"gonna do now, Quagmire?
"
,,
5,12,"Hey, it-it's all right.
"
,,
5,12,"I got enough in my savings
"
,,
5,12,"until I find another job.
"
,,
5,12,"I'll be fine.
"
,,
5,12,"Mom! Dad!
"
,,
5,12,"There's somebody in my tree house!
"
,,
5,12,"Yeah, and there's an annoying
"
,,
5,12,"little homo screaming in my kitchen.
"
,,
5,12,"Which one do you think
"
,,
5,12,"I'm more pissed about?
"
,,
5,12,"I'll remind you that I was invited here!
"
,,
5,12,"All right, who's up there?
"
,,
5,12," Oh, hey, Peter. Hey, Lois.
"
,,
5,12," Glenn, what are you doing up there?
"
,,
5,12,"Oh, I kind of moved in, if that's okay.
"
,,
5,12,"No airline'll hire me after the accident.
"
,,
5,12,"I'm broke and jobless.
"
,,
5,12,"Quagmire, you belong in a tree.
"
,,
5,12,"You're a nut.
"
,,
5,12,"What?!
"
,,
5,12,"Come on down, Quagmire.
"
,,
5,12,"You're staying with us.
"
,,
5,12,"Oh, great. This is gonna be worse
"
,,
5,12,"than the time I lived with Marlee Matlin.
"
,,
5,12,"Hi, Stewie.
"
,,
5,12,"Oh, come on, Marlee,
"
,,
5,12,"I know you can't hear them,
"
,,
5,12,"but you got to feel those
"
,,
5,12,"things slapping out of there!
"
,,
5,12,"Listen, I really want to thank you guys
"
,,
5,12,"for taking me in in my time of need.
"
,,
5,12,"Aw, forget it, Quagmire. It's the least
"
,,
5,12,"we could do after what happened.
"
,,
5,12,"Hello?
"
,,
5,12,"Oh, you must have a wrong number.
"
,,
5,12,"There's no one here by the name
"
,,
5,12,"of Longrod Von Hugendong.
"
,,
5,12," Okay, now add 20.
"
,,
5,12," Okay.
"
,,
5,12," Now multiply it by four.
"
,,
5,12," Okay.
"
,,
5,12," And what do you got?
"
,,
5,12," 8,008.
"
,,
5,12,"And what does 8,008 look
"
,,
5,12,"like on a calculator?
"
,,
5,12,"Oh, ""boob""!
"
,,
5,12,"Boob! Yeah!
"
,,
5,12,"All right! All right! All right!
"
,,
5,12,"Boob!
"
,,
5,12,"What if we had two calculators
"
,,
5,12,"and we put them next to each other?
"
,,
5,12,"Yes, yes, yes.
"
,,
5,12,"Find one, yes!
"
,,
5,12,"Didn't mean to wake ya.
"
,,
5,12,"Peter, you and I need
"
,,
5,12,"to talk about Quagmire.
"
,,
5,12,"He's been living with us for over a
"
,,
5,12,"month, and I think it's enough now.
"
,,
5,12,"Lois, I'm the whole reason
"
,,
5,12,"he lost his job and his house.
"
,,
5,12,"Besides, I can't throw
"
,,
5,12,"my best friend out on the street
"
,,
5,12,"like a prom night Dumpster baby.
"
,,
5,12,"Hey, what are you doing out here?
"
,,
5,12,"Don't you want to dance?
"
,,
5,12,"Sure!
"
,,
5,12,"but boy, it's awfully sad</i>
"
,,
5,12," And though he came from a hole</i>
"
,,
5,12," He's singing right from the soul</i>
"
,,
5,12,"And somebody to spank it</i>

"

5,12,"Besides, Quagmire
"
,,
5,12,"doesn't even have a job.
"
,,
5,12,"Well, you're gonna have
"
,,
5,12,"to help him find one,
"
,,
5,12,"because I've had enough of
"
,,
5,12,"him living in this house.
"
,,
5,12,"You're overreacting, Lois.
"
,,
5,12,"And you can't spell
"
,,
5,12,"""overreacting"" without ""ovary.""
"
,,
5,12," 'Cause you're a girl.
"
,,
5,12," I'm not overreacting!
"
,,
5,12,"Hey, uh, just an FYI,
"
,,
5,12,"really no reason to go into
"
,,
5,12,"any greater detail than this.
"
,,
5,12,"Uh, Stewie should probably
"
,,
5,12,"never use this pacifier again.
"
,,
5,12,"Okay, so I'll talk to him tomorrow?
"
,,
5,12," So how's the job hunt going?
"
,,
5,12," It's awful, Cleveland.
"
,,
5,12," Quagmire blew every gig we got him.
"
,,
5,12," It's too bad.
"
,,
5,12,"I really liked that job working
"
,,
5,12,"on the Starship Enterprise.
"
,,
5,12,"Dude,
"
,,
5,12,"you got to introduce me
"
,,
5,12,"to that black chick.
"
,,
5,12,"Guys, the only thing I know
"
,,
5,12,"how to do is fly a plane.
"
,,
5,12,"That's what I was born for.
"
,,
5,12,"And I'll never be happy
"
,,
5,12,"unless I can do it again.
"
,,
5,12,"Then that's the only answer.
"
,,
5,12,"Somehow we've got to get
"
,,
5,12,"Quagmire his job back.
"
,,
5,12,"Fellas, I think I have an idea.
"
,,
5,12,"Okay, guys, let's go over
"
,,
5,12,"the plan one more time.
"
,,
5,12,"passenger on the 6:00 flight to New York.</i>
"
,,
5,12,"the flight attendants' lounge</i>
"
,,
5,12,"the security personnel.</i>
"
,,
5,12,"and credentials,</i>
"
,,
5,12,"plane posing as flight attendants.</i>
"
,,
5,12,"we drug the pilots.</i>
"
,,
5,12,"step in and land the plane safely,</i>
"
,,
5,12,"Everybody clear?
"
,,
5,12,"Boy, this sounds like more trouble
"
,,
5,12,"than a moose on the interstate.
"
,,
5,12,"Hey, can you help me out?
"
,,
5,12,"I'm trying to get a couple of
"
,,
5,12,"bucks for something to eat.
"
,,
5,12," What's ""moose stuff""?
"
,,
5,12," Whatever you want it to be.
"
,,
5,12,"I could have sex with you
"
,,
5,12,"or I could just stand over there
"
,,
5,12,"and drink from the lake.
"
,,
5,12,"And everything in between.
"
,,
5,12,"Get in.
"
,,
5,12,"All right, I'm gonna go
"
,,
5,12,"bring the pilots their coffee.
"
,,
5,12,"Hang on to something, 'cause
"
,,
5,12,"this ride's about to get rougher
"
,,
5,12,"than dating a hot girl
"
,,
5,12,"with a bad laugh.
"
,,
5,12," I really like you, Sandy.
"
,,
5,12," I really like you, too, Peter.
"
,,
5,12,"Yeah? You like it when I kiss you here?
"
,,
5,12," Yeah.
"
,,
5,12," How about here?
"
,,
5,12,"Oh, stop, I'm tick...
"
,,
5,12,"Ma'am, I hate to be a nuisance,
"
,,
5,12,"but your son stopped
"
,,
5,12,"kicking the back of my chair.
"
,,
5,12,"Thank you.
"
,,
5,12,"Oh, no!
"
,,
5,12,"Both the pilots are unconscious,
"
,,
5,12,"and we're in a nosedive.
"
,,
5,12,"If only there was someone
"
,,
5,12,"on board who could save us.
"
,,
5,12,"I said if only there was someone
"
,,
5,12,"on board who could save us.
"
,,
5,12,"Uh, Peter, I don't see Quagmire.
"
,,
5,12," Oh, that was great.
"
,,
5,12," Thanks.
"
,,
5,12,"I know you have a choice in airport sex,
"
,,
5,12,"and I appreciate your choosing Quagmire.
"
,,
5,12,"Please exercise caution when standing up,
"
,,
5,12,"as the contents of your panties
"
,,
5,12,"may have shifted during coitus.
"
,,
5,12,"All right, I got a plane to catch.
"
,,
5,12,"Say, which gate is flight 209?
"
,,
5,12,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
"
,,
5,12,"That plane's going down! My friends are
"
,,
5,12,"on that plane! They're all gonna die!
"
,,
5,12," What?! Oh, no!
"
,,
5,12," And that's not the worst part.
"
,,
5,12,"Here's the condom I said I put on.
"
,,
5,12,"Aren't I just the worst?
"
,,
5,12," Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.
"
,,
5,12," And I'm Diane Simmons.
"
,,
5,12,"More trouble in the skies
"
,,
5,12,"over Quahog tonight,

"
,,
5,12,"Hugh Hefner?!
"
,,
5,12,"You look like you got
"
,,
5,12,"something on your mind.
"
,,
5,12,"Ah, who the hell am I kidding?
"
,,
5,12,"I don't deserve to be a pilot.
"
,,
5,12," I've let everybody down.
"
,,
5,12," Did you do the best you could?
"
,,
5,12,"No. I was gonna, but I ended up
"
,,
5,12,"getting laid instead.
"
,,
5,12,"That reminds me of a guy
"
,,
5,12,"you might've heard of.
"
,,
5,12,"John Holmes.
"
,,
5,12,"Greatest porn star who ever lived.
"
,,
5,12,"You know what he once said?
"
,,
5,12,"He said : ""You know,
"
,,
5,12,"I've got a 13-inch member...""
"
,,
5,12,"""and Glenn Quagmire is the best
"
,,
5,12,"damn pilot I've ever seen.""
"
,,
5,12," John Holmes said that?
"
,,
5,12," You bet he did...
"
,,
5,12,"right before he died a very
"
,,
5,12,"painful, AIDS-related death
"
,,
5,12,"from having unprotected sex
"
,,
5,12,"with so many people.
"
,,
5,12,"Excuse me, Hef.
"
,,
5,12,"I got a plane to land.
"
,,
5,12," We're all gonna die!
"
,,
5,12," I can't believe this is happening!
"
,,
5,12," Help!</i>
"
,,
5,12,"Men, we're doing everything
"
,,
5,12,"in our power to get you down.
"
,,
5,12,"Stand aside, sir.
"
,,
5,12,"I'll take it from here.
"
,,
5,12,"Peter, this is Quagmire.
"
,,
5,12,"Now I want you to listen very
"
,,
5,12,"carefully and do exactly as I tell you.
"
,,
5,12,"Take a firm hold of the throttle, and
"
,,
5,12,"pull the red mixture knob out slowly.
"
,,
5,12,"All right, now do you see a button
"
,,
5,12,"that looks like a drunken gay guy
"
,,
5,12,"eyeing you from across the bar?
"
,,
5,12,"Yeah, I see it.
"
,,
5,12,"All right, press the button
"
,,
5,12,"right above it.

5,12,"is apparently talking the plane down.
"
,,
5,12,"Ollie Williams has the story. Ollie?
"
,,
5,12," I'm at the wrong airport.
"
,,
5,12," Oops. Well, thanks, Ollie.
"
,,
5,12,"Coming up : Why calling every
"
,,
5,12,"Asian man you meet ""Chung King""
"
,,
5,12,"can land an anchorman in hot water.
"
,,
5,12,"After this.
"
,,
5,12,"All right, Peter, slide
"
,,
5,12,"the red knob all the way out.
"
,,
5,12,"And the second those wheels touch the
"
,,
5,12,"ground, you hit the emergency brake.
"
,,
5,12," We made it!
"
,,
5,12," Hallelujah!
"
,,
5,12,"Get some!
"
,,
5,12,"Well, guess there's nothing left to
"
,,
5,12,"do but watch the end of Last Holiday.
"
,,
5,12,"Damn!
"
,,
5,12,"Oh, no, she di-in't.
"
,,
5,12," Oh, yes, she did.
"
,,
5,12," No, she di-in't.
"
,,
5,12," Yes, she did.
"
,,
5,12," No, she di-in't.
"
,,
5,12," Yes, she did, Peter! I just saw it!
"
,,
5,12," All right, take it easy.
"
,,
5,12,"Ah, Glenn, we are so thrilled for you.
"
,,
5,12,"Yeah, guess it didn't take too much
"
,,
5,12,"for you to get your job back,
"
,,
5,12," now that you're a hero.
"
,,
5,12," Yeah, and I'm so happy for you,
"
,,
5,12,"I don't even mind that I was
"
,,
5,12,"raped in a federal prison
"
,,
5,12,"after I was arrested for hijacking.
"
,,
5,12,"Well, I couldn't have
"
,,
5,12,"done it without you, guys.
"
,,
5,12,"You put yourselves on the line
"
,,
5,12,"and you gave me my life back.
"
,,
5,12,"I'll never forget that.
"
,,
5,12,"Now, if you'll excuse me.
"
,,
5,12,"I got to go to work.

5,13,"This was such a great idea
"

5,13,"for a weekend activity.
"
,,
5,13,"Well, I thought it'd be good
"

5,13,"to get out of the house.
"

5,13,"I don't like the kids being
"

5,13,"around that racist sunflower
"

5,13,"that's growing in our yard.
"

5,13,"Hey, boy,
"

5,13," don't you come walking by this house.
"

5,13," You're ignorant.
"

5,13,"Hey, Mr. Eel.
"

5,13,"You're slippery.
"
,,
5,13,"Oops, got away.
"

5,13,"Left my hand smelling funny.

5,13,"Come here, Jesse. Smell my finger.
"

5,13,"Today was a good day.
"

5,13,"Hey, look, kids, it's a recreation
"

5,13,"of the lost city of New Orleans.
"
,,
5,13,"Dad, was there ever a
"

5,13,"real city of New Orleans?
"
,,
5,13,"No one knows, Chris. No one knows.
"
,,
5,13,"Hey, Brian, look, I'm a stripper.
"
,,
5,13,"I'm working my way through college.
"
,,
5,13,"I should be more reluctant
"
,,
5,13,"to take my clothes off,
"
,,
5,13,"but I'm not because my stepfather
"
,,
5,13,"had boundary issues.
"
,,
5,13,"Hey, there, Mr. Octopus.
"
,,
5,13,"I see you got two eyes but not much else.
"
,,
5,13,"We can fix that.
"
,,
5,13,"Let's give you a nice tweedlie
"
,,
5,13,"little mustache here.
"
,,
5,13,"And maybe a big ol' dumb
"
,,
5,13,"guy smiley mouth.
"
,,
5,13,"And a couple of eyebrows
"
,,
5,13,"with one raised up
"
,,
5,13,"like you're saying, ""Say what?""
"
,,
5,13,"Oh. Look who's got pimples.
"
,,
5,13,"And right before the big dance.
"
,,
5,13,"It's so sucky and squeezy!
"
,,
5,13,"I'll handle this.
"
,,
5,13,"I've tangled with the
"

5,13,"likes of these before.
"
,,
5,13,"Wow, that was awesome, Mr. Seamus.
"

5,13,"Ah, it was nothing. That's how
"

"

5,13," My poop.
"

5,13," That's right, and it's disgusting.
"
,,
5,13,"I am sick of you using the
"

5,13,"front yard as your bathroom.
"
,,
5,13,"It's time you learned to use
"

5,13,"the toilet like everyone else.
"
,,
5,13,"I'm going to sneeze,
"
,,
5,13,"I'm going to sneeze...
"

5,13,"Bye, Lois. I'm going to the gym.
"

5,13,"Okay, see ya la...
"
,,
5,13,"Wait. What?
"
,,
5,13,"Since when do you go to the gym?
"
,,
5,13,"Well, it's just that whole thing
"
,,
5,13,"at the aquarium made me realize
"
,,
5,13,"I'm completely out of shape.
"
,,
5,13,"I mean, what if I run into
"
,,
5,13,"that octopus again?
"
,,
5,13," Peter, that's ridiculous.
"
,,
5,13,"I got all day.
"
,,
5,13,"Hey, is that your wife?
"
,,
5,13,"Hey, I didn't know you
"
,,
5,13,"guys work out here?
"

5,13,"Yeah, it's a weekly regiment.
"

5,13,"Come on, come on, Cleveland, push it.

5,13,"Come on, come on, push it, push it.

"

5,13,"Glenn, Glenn, Glenn, Glenn...
"
,,
5,13,"Will you guys quiet down?
"
,,
5,13,"I'm trying to concentrate on my cardio.
"
,,
5,13,"Hey, you guys the trainers here?
"
,,
5,13,"Why, look, Barnaby,
"
,,
5,13,"a new recreation enthusiast.
"
,,
5,13,"We'll start off your workout
"
,,
5,13,"with vigorous calisthenics
"
,,
5,13,"executed in rhythmic time
"
,,
5,13,"with acetate pressings
"
,,
5,13,"of the new musical craze called jazz.
"
,,
5,13," How do you think it works?
"
,,
5,13," I have no idea.
"
,,
5,13,"Look, Lois told me I had
"
,,
5,13,"to start using the toilet
"
,,
5,13,"and you're the one
"
,,
5,13,"who's had potty training, so
"
,,
5,13," I'm counting on you to help me.
"
,,
5,13," All right.
"
,,
5,13,"We're two intelligent guys,
"
,,
5,13,"we can figure this out.
"
,,
5,13,"What's that big back part?
"
,,
5,13,"Maybe that's where the wizard
"
,,
5,13,"lives who operates this thing.
"
,,
5,13,"It would be wise not to anger him.
"
,,
5,13,"I wonder what this thing is for.
"
,,
5,13,"Brian, be careful with that.
"
,,
5,13,"We don't know what it does.
"
,,
5,13,"All right, here goes.
"
,,
5,13,"Oh, God, oh, God, careful,
"
,,
5,13,"careful. Careful. Careful.
"
,,
5,13,"Don't mind me, you guys.
"
,,
5,13,"I'm just writing a letter
"

5,13,"to my boyfriend.
"
,,
5,13,"""Dear, my boyfriend,""
"
,,
5,13,"""Thank you for making out with me
"

5,13,"recently on purpose. That was cool.""
"
,,
5,13,"""Those flowers that you totally
"
,,
5,13,"sent me were really pretty,""
"
,,
5,13,"""just like you said I am.""
"
,,
5,13,"""Love, Meg.""
"
,,
5,13,"Meg, you are so full of crap. You're
"
,,
5,13,"like those people who sit in Starbucks
"
,,
5,13,"and publicly write on their laptops.
"
,,
5,13,"Hey, getting some writing
"
,,
5,13,"done there, buddy?
"
,,
5,13,"Yeah, setting up in public so everybody
"
,,
5,13,"can watch me type my big screenplay.
"
,,
5,13,"Me, too. All real writers
"
,,
5,13,"need to be seen writing,
"
,,
5,13," otherwise, what's the point, right?
"
,,
5,13," You should totally write that down.
"
,,
5,13,"Okay. Will you watch me?
"
,,
5,13,"Hello, flabby, out-of-shape family.
"
,,
5,13,"Check out my bulging rippliness.
"
,,
5,13,"Peter, you've been to the gym once...
"
,,
5,13,"for 15 minutes.
"
,,
5,13,"And I'm 15 minutes stronger, Brian.
"
,,
5,13,"I'd rip a phone book in half,
"
,,
5,13,"but for the life of me,
"
,,
5,13,"I don't know anyone who uses
"
,,
5,13,"a phone book anymore.
"
,,
5,13,"So I'll use Meg's laptop.
"
,,
5,13,"Dad! What the hell?!
"
,,
5,13,"Look at him in that tank top.
"
,,
5,13,"He looks more pathetic than John
"
,,
5,13,"Merrick when he went on Match.com.
"
,,
5,13,"There's no way you're a size six.
"
,,
5,13,"I haven't felt this good in years.
"
,,
5,13,"I feel like Arnold Schwarzenegger
"
,,
5,13,"without the fruity accent and
"
,,
5,13,"the Pirates of the Caribbean wife.
"
,,
5,13,"Excuse me, sir. Secret Service. I wonder
"
,,
5,13,"if we might ask for your assistance.
"
,,
5,13," Yeah, what's the problem?
"
,,
5,13," We're with President Clinton's motorcade.
"
,,
5,13,"It seems he blew a tire
"
,,
5,13,"in front of your house.
"
,,
5,13,"Would you happen to have
"
,,
5,13,"a jack we could borrow?
"
,,
5,13,"You don't need a jack. I am a jack.
"
,,
5,13,"Come on, I'll lift that thing for you.
"
,,
5,13,"Hey, I appreciate your help, man.
"
,,
5,13,"We're a little overloaded 'cause
"
,,
5,13,"I'm having a fat chick party back here.
"
,,
5,13,"All right, girls. I've turned off the AC.
"
,,
5,13,"First one to have a bead of neck
"
,,
5,13,"sweat reach their butt crack wins.
"
,,
5,13,"All right, boys,
"
,,
5,13,"now watch how this is done.
"
,,
5,13,"The key is to put it all
"
,,
5,13,"in your groin and your back.
"
,,
5,13,"Take your legs totally out
"
,,
5,13,"of the equation.
"
,,
5,13,"Lift with your lower back
"
,,
5,13,"in a jerking, twisting motion.
"
,,
5,13," Peter!
"
,,
5,13," My God!
"
,,
5,13,"Call an ambulance!
"
,,
5,13,"ain't got my herpes yet?</i>
"
,,
5,13,"How's the hernia, Peter?
"
,,
5,13,"You know what the
"
,,
5,13,"worst part of it is, Lois?
"
,,
5,13,"I thought I was just out of shape,
"
,,
5,13,"but that ain't it at all.
"
,,
5,13,"I got to face the fact that
"
,,
5,13,"I'm just getting old.
"
,,
5,13,"Knock, knock.
"
,,
5,13,"Mr. President, what are you doing here?
"
,,
5,13,"Well, I felt so bad that Peter
"
,,
5,13,"hurt himself fixing my car,
"
,,
5,13,"I wanted to stop by
"
,,
5,13,"and extend my good wishes.
"
,,
5,13,"Whoa! Bill Clinton!
"
,,
5,13,"Hey, can I get a picture
"
,,
5,13,"of you on my cell phone?
"
,,
5,13,"Sure.
"
,,
5,13,"You know where I got that nipple ring?
"
,,
5,13,"Ol' Straddlin' Madeleine Albright
"
,,
5,13,"gave it to me.
"
,,
5,13,"Say, you look like
"
,,
5,13,"you're pretty down, Peter.
"
,,
5,13,"It's just that I'm starting to realize
"
,,
5,13,"I'm not as young as I used to be.
"
,,
5,13,"I hear you.
"
,,
5,13,"After my bypass, I remember wondering
"
,,
5,13,"if it was all downhill from there.
"
,,
5,13,"But then I realized
"
,,
5,13,"it doesn't have to be.
"
,,
5,13,"You're only as young as you feel.
"
,,
5,13,"I don't know, Reagan,
"
,,
5,13,"I wish I could believe that.
"
,,
5,13,"I'm going to make you believe it.
"
,,
5,13,"When you get out of here,
"
,,
5,13,"I'm going to take you out
"
,,
5,13,"and show you the time of your life.
"
,,
5,13,"And by the time we're done,
"
,,
5,13,"I promise you're going to feel
"
,,
5,13,"like a young man again.
"
,,
5,13,"Well, if you really think it'll help.
"
,,
5,13,"I sure do. Know what else will help?
"
,,
5,13,"A little saxophone therapy.
"
,,
5,13,"You can have me.
"
,,
5,13,"What's that?
"
,,
5,13,"Since I couldn't help you learn to use
"
,,
5,13,"the toilet, I found something that can.
"
,,
5,13,"It's an instructional video
"
,,
5,13,"on toilet training.
"
,,
5,13,"Hi, I'm Roy Scheider.
"
,,
5,13,"And today we're going
"
,,
5,13,"to learn to use the potty.
"
,,
5,13,"Folks, say hi to my pal Hungry Hank.
"
,,
5,13," How's it going, Hank?
"
,,
5,13," I'm hungry for your poo.
"
,,
5,13,"Don't make me starve.
"
,,
5,13,"Remember, it's all about relaxing
"
,,
5,13,"and letting your body do
"
,,
5,13,"what it does naturally.
"
,,
5,13,"to powder my ass.</i>
"
,,
5,13,"All right, Peter, we've got
"
,,
5,13,"a big day ahead of us.
"
,,
5,13,"I'm going to show you that
"
,,
5,13,"age is just a state of mind.
"
,,
5,13," Come on, hop in my limo.
"
,,
5,13," Wow, a limo!
"
,,
5,13,"Shotgun!
"
,,
5,13," Watch the screen, not your feet.
"
,,
5,13," Bill, shut up, I got it.
"
,,
5,13," Oh, no, our pizza's ready.
"
,,
5,13," Tag out, man, tag out.
"
,,
5,13,"Oh, boy, this is going to be fun.
"
,,
5,13,"I haven't made a crank call in years.
"
,,
5,13,"Shh! Quiet, quiet. It's ringing.
"
,,
5,13,"Hello, is this Linda Tripp?
"
,,
5,13,"You shouldn't have talked,
"
,,
5,13,"you stupid bitch! I hope you die!
"
,,
5,13,"Boy, that, uh...
"
,,
5,13,"that wasn't really a crank call,
"
,,
5,13,"that was...
"
,,
5,13," that was just unpleasant.
"
,,
5,13," Sorry about that.
"
,,
5,13,"It's okay. You know what, Bill?
"
,,
5,13,"You were right.
"
,,
5,13,"Ever since you and I have been
"
,,
5,13,"hanging out, I feel 20 years younger.
"
,,
5,13,"You've completely changed my life.
"
,,
5,13,"See, I told you, Peter,
"
,,
5,13,"age is just a state of mind.
"
,,
5,13,"So what do you want to do next?
"
,,
5,13,"Go to Mars, dude.
"
,,
5,13," Boy, I'm getting kind of hungry.
"
,,
5,13," Me, too.
"
,,
5,13,"Hey! Hey, pull over, man! Pull over!
"
,,
5,13,"Dude, check it out!
"
,,
5,13,"There's a pig behind that fence.
"
,,
5,13,"Oh, yeah, I see it!
"
,,
5,13,"Dude, we could eat that pig!
"
,,
5,13," What?
"
,,
5,13," Dude, come on!
"
,,
5,13,"We could totally eat that pig.
"
,,
5,13,"We could... we could do it,
"
,,
5,13,"man! We could!
"
,,
5,13,"It would be so easy, man!
"
,,
5,13,"It would take, like a minute.
"
,,
5,13,"Could it really be that fast?
"
,,
5,13,"Peter, that pig...
"
,,
5,13,"could be in our stomachs in,
"
,,
5,13,"like one minute, and then we could...
"
,,
5,13,"and then... and then
"
,,
5,13,"we could do other stuff.
"
,,
5,13,"All right. I'm starved. Let's do it.
"
,,
5,13,"Who's there?!
"
,,
5,13,"Aw, crap! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
"
,,
5,13,"Dog gone it!
"
,,
5,13,"If he wanted a pig,
"
,,
5,13,"why didn't he just take my wife?
"
,,
5,13,"And now, ladies and gentlemen,
"
,,
5,13,"Mr. Conway Twitty.
"
,,
5,13,"Hello, old friend.
"
,,
5,13," What the hell?!
"
,,
5,13," No! No!
"
,,
5,13,"You do not go on this lawn!
"
,,
5,13,"Brian, I've had enough of this.
"
,,
5,13,"It's more disgusting than when
"
,,
5,13,"you gave me that Christmas gift.
"
,,
5,13,"Oh, what is it? A little birdie?
"
,,
5,13,"Oh, my God! It's dead!
"
,,
5,13,"Brian!
"
,,
5,13,"Oh, Brian, this is disgusting!
"
,,
5,13,"Oh, my God! Get it out of here!
"
,,
5,13,"I'm... I'm sorry. I thought...
"
,,
5,13,"I thought you'd like it.
"
,,
5,13,"Brian, I love it!
"
,,
5,13,"I'm going to call you Stickyhead.
"
,,
5,13,"I love you, Stickyhead.
"
,,
5,13,"Brian, if you're not going to use
"
,,
5,13,"the toilet, there's only one solution.
"
,,
5,13,"Brian, did you know that Brad Pitt
"
,,
5,13,"is John Lithgow's nephew?
"
,,
5,13," He is?
"
,,
5,13," No.
"
,,
5,13,"But doesn't that sound like
"
,,
5,13,"something that could be true?
"
,,
5,13,"My God! You're wearing a diaper!
"
,,
5,13," You look silly.
"
,,
5,13," Why? You wear a diaper.
"
,,
5,13,"Yes, but I'm a baby.
"
,,
5,13,"People see my diaper, and they say :
"
,,
5,13,"""Oh, how cute! I bet he
"
,,
5,13,"smells like baby powder.""
"
,,
5,13,"They see your diaper and think :
"
,,
5,13,"""Ew! That dog is sick. He must be dying.""
"
,,
5,13,"""I hope he doesn't leak on our carpet.
"
,,
5,13,"Why don't they just put him to sleep?""
"
,,
5,13,"You know, at this point,
"
,,
5,13,"I'd probably welcome that.
"
,,
5,13,"Oh, hey, come on, man.
"
,,
5,13,"You just got to get used to it.
"
,,
5,13,"Hey, have you gone yet?
"
,,
5,13,"Have you popped your butt cherry?
"
,,
5,13,"You know, you should be more
"
,,
5,13,"sensitive to my humiliation.
"
,,
5,13,"Remember how bad you felt when you
"
,,
5,13,"drew that picture for Peter and Lois?
"
,,
5,13,"Oh, Stewie, it's wonderful!
"
,,
5,13,"This is going right up on the fridge.
"
,,
5,13,"Really?! The fridge?!
"
,,
5,13,"It's like we have a little
"
,,
5,13,"Michelangelo in the house.
"
,,
5,13,"Okay! See you guys later.
"
,,
5,13,"I almost lost it when you said
"
,,
5,13,"to put it on the fridge.
"
,,
5,13,"I know! What the hell is this supposed
"
,,
5,13,"to be, a pelican or a school bus?
"
,,
5,13,"Looks like Muhammad Ali drew this.
"
,,
5,13,"What a dumbass! Hey, let's spit on it.
"
,,
5,13,"Peter!
"
,,
5,13,"Oh! Oh, Lois!
"
,,
5,13,"Let me make you some coffee.
"
,,
5,13,"Ow! It bit me!</i>
"
,,
5,13,"What the hell did you
"
,,
5,13,"and Bill do last night?!
"
,,
5,13,"We lived, Lois. We lived our lives.
"
,,
5,13,"Peter, that former President Clinton
"
,,
5,13,"is nothing but a bad influence!
"
,,
5,13,"I forbid you to hang out
"
,,
5,13,"with him anymore.
"
,,
5,13,"No way. Bill Clinton makes me feel young.
"
,,
5,13,"Not like you, with your
"
,,
5,13,"Judd Hirsch sweater
"
,,
5,13,"and your bag of Werther's Originals.
"
,,
5,13,"If he won't listen, I'm just going to
"
,,
5,13,"have to go talk to Bill Clinton myself.
"
,,
5,13,"Mr. President, I need to
"
,,
5,13,"have a word with you!
"
,,
5,13,"Wow! You certainly are very persuasive.
"
,,
5,13,"So I've been told.
"
,,
5,13,"Hey, you want to give me that cigar.
"
,,
5,13,"I'm ready to smoke it now.
"
,,
5,13,"What the hell was I thinking?
"
,,
5,13,"I-I don't know what came over me.
"
,,
5,13,"Oh, God! What am I going to do?
"
,,
5,13,"Hey, Bill, you up for a little bowling?
"
,,
5,13,"I swiped some money out of
"
,,
5,13,"Lois's purse. I don't think she'll notice
"
,,
5,13,"because she's here humping you?!
"
,,
5,13,"Peter!
"
,,
5,13,"Look, I know this looks bad,
"
,,
5,13,"and I feel horrible, and
"
,,
5,13,"I know nothing I could say to
"
,,
5,13,"you could possibly justify
"
,,
5,13,"why I slept with Bill except...
"
,,
5,13,"I mean, Peter, the man presided over the
"
,,
5,13,"longest economic expansion in US history,
"
,,
5,13,"and he reduced the percentage
"
,,
5,13,"of Americans on welfare
"
,,
5,13,"to its lowest level in 33 years.
"
,,
5,13," 35 years.
"
,,
5,13," 35 years, Peter.
"
,,
5,13,"Well, well. I learned something today.
"
,,
5,13,"Apparently, there's the side
"
,,
5,13,"of Bill Clinton the world knows,
"
,,
5,13,"and then there's the dark,
"
,,
5,13,"sex-crazed side only I know.
"
,,
5,13,"I'm so sorry, Peter.
"
,,
5,13,"Lois, I think maybe it's better
"
,,
5,13,"if I stay at Quagmire's for a while.
"
,,
5,13,"I understand.
"
,,
5,13,"Hey, Lois, you up for
"
,,
5,13,"a little exit polling?
"
,,
5,13,"Oh, God!
"
,,
5,13,"I've been a worse wife
"
,,
5,13,"than Lorena Bobbitt
"
,,
5,13,"when she was married to The Thing.
"
,,
5,13,"Oh, my God! Where is it?!
"
,,
5,13,"Where did she throw it?!
"
,,
5,13,"Oh, God! Oh, God!
"
,,
5,13,"Is this what you're looking for?
"
,,
5,13,"I can't believe Lois would cheat on me.
"
,,
5,13,"Look, Peter, I know this is
"
,,
5,13,"a very difficult time for you,
"
,,
5,13,"but I want you to know I'm here
"
,,
5,13,"for you if you need anything.
"
,,
5,13,"Quagmire, I know your heart's
"
,,
5,13,"in the right place, but
"
,,
5,13,"I need to sort this out for myself.
"
,,
5,13,"I haven't misjudged someone
"
,,
5,13,"this bad since my last physical.
"
,,
5,13,"All right.
"
,,
5,13,"The doctor will be in in a few minutes.
"
,,
5,13,"What do you want?
"
,,
5,13,"Honey, I just feel awful
"
,,
5,13,"about this whole situation.
"
,,
5,13,"But I think I've got a solution that
"
,,
5,13,"will make things right for both of us.
"
,,
5,13," I'm listening.
"
,,
5,13," Well...
"
,,
5,13,"the way I figure it, the only way
"
,,
5,13,"to even things out between us
"
,,
5,13,"is if you have sex
"
,,
5,13,"with someone else, too.
"
,,
5,13,"You...
"
,,
5,13," want to get me laid?
"
,,
5,13," Yes, Peter.
"
,,
5,13," Because I don't want to lose you.
"
,,
5,13," Well, it would make us even.
"
,,
5,13,"All right, Lois, if you
"
,,
5,13,"really think it'll work.
"
,,
5,13,"Trust me. It'll work better
"
,,
5,13,"than the first telephone.
"
,,
5,13,"Well, we did it, Watson.
"
,,
5,13,"What an afternoon.
"
,,
5,13,"We've finally perfected
"
,,
5,13,"the first telephone.
"
,,
5,13,"Yeah. Uh...
"
,,
5,13,"Hey, listen, somebody
"
,,
5,13,"called me today. Uh...
"
,,
5,13,"Whoever it was said some
"
,,
5,13,"very sexual things.
"
,,
5,13,"Some very angry, sexual things.
"
,,
5,13,"Oh, really?
"
,,
5,13,"Probably just some teenagers
"
,,
5,13,"somewhere. Damn them.
"
,,
5,13,"Well, that's the thing. I mean,
"
,,
5,13,"there's only two phones in the...
"
,,
5,13,"well, in the world, and
"
,,
5,13,"one of them is in my office,
"
,,
5,13,"and the other's in your office, and
"
,,
5,13,"those two didn't even exist
"
,,
5,13,"until about a few hours ago.
"
,,
5,13,"Yikes! I could use a
"
,,
5,13,"distraction right now.
"
,,
5,13,"Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Conway Twitty.
"
,,
5,13,"of your heart beating</i>
"
,,
5,13,"All right, Peter, who's it going to be?
"
,,
5,13,"Who do you want to sleep with?
"
,,
5,13,"Who we kidding, Lois?
"
,,
5,13,"This is never going to work.
"
,,
5,13," Let's just forget the whole thing.
"
,,
5,13," No, honey, it's got to work.
"
,,
5,13,"Just pick somebody,
"
,,
5,13,"and I'll make it happen.
"
,,
5,13,"Deep down, in your heart of hearts,
"
,,
5,13,"if it could be anyone in the
"
,,
5,13,"world, who would it be?
"
,,
5,13,"Halle Berry? Ann-Margret?
"
,,
5,13," Anybody I want?
"
,,
5,13," Anybody.
"
,,
5,13,"Don't be afraid to tell me.
"
,,
5,13,"Babs.
"
,,
5,13," My mother?
"
,,
5,13," Yeah.
"
,,
5,13,"Why?
"
,,
5,13,"It was my understanding that
"
,,
5,13,"there would be no questions asked.
"
,,
5,13,"I'm just curious. It's a little weird.
"
,,
5,13,"Look, you know what? She's hot.
"
,,
5,13,"Guilty, all right?
"
,,
5,13,"I haven't been so struck
"
,,
5,13,"by a woman's beauty
"
,,
5,13,"since I was Uma Thurman's
"
,,
5,13,"eye-wrangler on the set of Pulp Fiction.
"
,,
5,13,"No. You can't promise
"
,,
5,13,"something like that.
"
,,
5,13,"I have no idea what
"
,,
5,13,"you're going to say to me.
"
,,
5,13,"So you can go ahead and
"
,,
5,13,"say what you're going to say,
"
,,
5,13,"and my natural response
"
,,
5,13,"could be to get offended.
"
,,
5,13,"Then, through no fault of my own,
"
,,
5,13,"I wouldn't have kept my promise.
"
,,
5,13,"Well, Lois, this is an
"
,,
5,13,"unexpected surprise.
"
,,
5,13,"You and Peter should drop by more often.
"
,,
5,13,"Well, we were in the neighborhood,
"
,,
5,13,"and Peter said, ""Let's stop in.""
"
,,
5,13," Wasn't that thoughtful?
"
,,
5,13," Will you people quiet down?
"
,,
5,13,"I'm trying to watch Medium.
"
,,
5,13,"You know what? Daddy's right. Let's
"
,,
5,13,"go upstairs where we won't bother him.
"
,,
5,13,"Good.
"
,,
5,13,"All right. Go, Medium!
"
,,
5,13,"Wish I could talk to ghosts.
"
,,
5,13,"That would be sweet!
"
,,
5,13,"Mom, could we sit down for a second?
"
,,
5,13," I have to ask you something.
"
,,
5,13," What is it, Lois?
"
,,
5,13,"Well, Peter and I have hit a snag in our
"
,,
5,13,"marriage. I won't go with the details.
"
,,
5,13,"But it turns out that the only way
"
,,
5,13,"to make things right seems to be...
"
,,
5,13,"It... it's, uh... Oh, boy.
"
,,
5,13,"What's the best way to say this?
"
,,
5,13,"Um... Mom...
"
,,
5,13,"Would you have sex with Peter?
"
,,
5,13," Of course, dear.
"
,,
5,13," Really?
"
,,
5,13,"Carter's been most insufferable lately,
"
,,
5,13,"and this would just stick in his craw.
"
,,
5,13,"I like your freaky spirit,
"
,,
5,13,"but it's your craw I'm after.
"
,,
5,13," I didn't think you'd be so receptive.
"
,,
5,13," Are you kidding, Lois?
"
,,
5,13,"I'm physically starved.
"
,,
5,13,"Your father's utterly lost interest.
"
,,
5,13,"He won't even look me in
"
,,
5,13,"the back of the head anymore.
"
,,
5,13,"I see.
"
,,
5,13,"Well, I guess we're good to go then.
"
,,
5,13,"Peter, are you sure
"
,,
5,13,"this is what you want?
"
,,
5,13,"Yeah. I'll see you at home.
"
,,
5,13,"I can't do it!
"
,,
5,13,"I can't go through with it!
"
,,
5,13,"You have to, Peter,
"
,,
5,13,"for the sake of our marriage!
"
,,
5,13,"Screw our marriage! I love you!
"
,,
5,13," Really?
"
,,
5,13," Absolutely.
"
,,
5,13,"And I don't care that you slept with
"

5,13,"Clinton. We'll get past it somehow.
"
,,
5,13,"All I know is,
"
,,
5,13,"I don't want to do anything to hurt you.
"
,,
5,13,"Oh, Peter!
"
,,
5,13," Why are you naked in my house?
"
,,
5,13," Uh...
"
,,
5,13,"Why aren't you?
"
,,
5,13,"You're all right, Griffin.
"
,,
5,13,"Well, Peter, our marriage has
"
,,
5,13,"suffered a serious trial, but
"
,,
5,13," I think we can get through it.
"
,,
5,13," Me, too, Lois.
"
,,
5,13,"It's just going to take a little work.
"
,,
5,13,"In the meantime, I guess I better
"
,,
5,13,"clear the air with Clinton.
"
,,
5,13,"Hey, listen, Bill, uh...
"
,,
5,13,"you and I need to have a talk.
"
,,
5,13,"Boy, you are good. You are really good.
"
,,
5,13,"Well, look at you, using the toilet.
"
,,
5,13,"I am so proud of you.
"
,,
5,13,"Well, you deserve all the praise
"
,,
5,13,"for encouraging me to do it.
"
,,
5,13,"Well, still, good for you.
"
,,
5,13,"So where are you really
"
,,
5,13,"doing your business?
"
,,
5,13,"Oh, I found a place.
"
,,
5,13,"Well, I'll be damned.
"
,,
5,13,"And they called me crazy.
"
,,
5,13,"You can't plant sausage seeds, they said.
"
,,
5,13,"Well, look at this!

"

5,14,"I just don't think
"
,,
5,14,"you're being fair, Tyra.
"
,,
5,14,"You don't know what it's like
"
,,
5,14,"to grow up the way I grew up.
"
,,
5,14,"You know what? How dare you?!
"
,,
5,14,"You don't know me.
"
,,
5,14,"You have no idea where
"

5,14,"I come from, where I've been,
"
,,
5,14,"how long I've been there,
"
,,
5,14,"what I had to do to get from
"
,,
5,14,"where I was to where I am now!
"
,,
5,14," Hey there, Mort.
"
,,
5,14," Hi, Lois.
"
,,
5,14,"Neil's doing a report
"
,,
5,14,"on Christianity at school.
"
,,
5,14,"Do you have any crucifixes I can borrow?
"
,,
5,14,"Preferably one without
"
,,
5,14,"the little fellow on it?
"
,,
5,14,"Oh, of course, there's one
"
,,
5,14,"in the den. Help yourself.
"
,,
5,14,"God, I'm sick of Mort
"
,,
5,14,"always borrowing our stuff.
"
,,
5,14,"He's a bigger mooch than
"
,,
5,14,"the Mexican Super Friends.
"
,,
5,14,"Hey, Mexican Superman,
"
,,
5,14,"can I talk to you for a sec?
"
,,
5,14,"When you signed the lease,
"
,,
5,14,"you said there was going to be like
"
,,
5,14,"five of you living here.
"
,,
5,14,"Oh, no, they're not all living here.
"
,,
5,14,"They're just visiting.
"
,,
5,14,"Hey, Mexican Superman,
"
,,
5,14,"I got the keys made.
"
,,
5,14,"Hey, Mexican Batman, get out of here.
"
,,
5,14," What? I got like 60 keys.
"
,,
5,14," Silncio!
"
,,
5,14," Jefe aqu!
"
,,
5,14," Qu?
"
,,
5,14,"Evicin.
"
,,
5,14,"That ought to keep Mort away.
"
,,
5,14,"Peter, what the hell is that?
"
,,
5,14,"Lois, I'm tired of Mort
"
,,
5,14,"always mooching off us,
"
,,
5,14,"so I made a scare-Jew.
"
,,
5,14,"Peter, we're not gonna have
"
,,
5,14,"this in our front yard.
"
,,
5,14,"It's racist, and for God's sake,
"
,,
5,14,"you ruined your best suit.
"
,,
5,14,"Now we're gonna have
"
,,
5,14,"to get you a new one...
"
,,
5,14,"Shh. Lois Lois, look.
"
,,
5,14,"Hey, guys, I just wanted
"
,,
5,14,"to return your...
"
,,
5,14,"Oh! Oh, my God, it's Hitler! He's back!
"
,,
5,14,"He's back! Hurry, protect Jon Stewart!
"
,,
5,14,"He's our most important Jew!
"
,,
5,14,"Why do wo get me a suit here?
"
,,
5,14,"Well, since you keep ruining them, I'm
"
,,
5,14,"not going to buy you a brand-new one.
"
,,
5,14,"Yes, I'll take this teddy bear,
"
,,
5,14,"this ruler,
"
,,
5,14,"this piece of string and
"
,,
5,14,"this cardboard box.
"
,,
5,14,"Oh, look, an ""On The Raggedy Ann"" doll.
"
,,
5,14,"Well, I guess I can still play with it
"
,,
5,14,"three weeks out of the month.
"
,,
5,14," Hi, there. See anything you like?
"
,,
5,14," Oh, I'm just browsing.
"
,,
5,14,"Say, you look like you
"
,,
5,14,"could use an activity book
"
,,
5,14,"with half the activities done.
"
,,
5,14," That would save me half the time.
"
,,
5,14," Connect the dots?
"
,,
5,14,"Ha! More like set the book down
"
,,
5,14,"and have a beer.
"
,,
5,14,"You got yourself a deal.
"
,,
5,14,"What... are those?!
"
,,
5,14,"Oh, that's a pair of
"
,,
5,14,"red flannel feety pajamas.
"
,,
5,14,"Good Lord.
"
,,
5,14,"See, they've got a flap
"
,,
5,14,"that opens up in the back.
"
,,
5,14,"Are you telling me I could be
"
,,
5,14,"pooping and warm?
"
,,
5,14,"Exactly.
"
,,
5,14,"No longer would I have to make
"
,,
5,14,"a choice between the two.
"
,,
5,14,"Sir, here is a check with my name on it.
"
,,
5,14,"Write down any number on
"
,,
5,14,"this piece of paper, and I will pay it.
"
,,
5,14,"All right, so we roll the dice
"
,,
5,14,"and then we both have to yell
"
,,
5,14,"""Yahtzee"" really loud.
"
,,
5,14," At the same time?
"
,,
5,14," Yeah.
"
,,
5,14,"And you have to flap
"
,,
5,14,"your wrists like this.
"
,,
5,14,"And you'll do it, too?
"
,,
5,14," Of course, that's how it's done.
"
,,
5,14," Okay.
"
,,
5,14," All right, ready?
"
,,
5,14," Okay, you gonna do with me?
"
,,
5,14,"Oh, yeah.
"
,,
5,14,"Yahtzee!
"
,,
5,14," Gay.
"
,,
5,14," You suck!
"
,,
5,14,"Hey, everybody, I'm home from work.
"
,,
5,14,"My God, Peter, you wore
"
,,
5,14,"those pajamas to your office?
"
,,
5,14,"Hey, at least
"
,,
5,14,"I'm mixing it up a little bit.
"
,,
5,14,"Green shirt, tan pants,
"
,,
5,14,"that's refreshing.
"
,,
5,14,"Oh, boy does it feel good
"
,,
5,14,"to undo my butt flap.
"
,,
5,14,"Ew, Dad! We don't want to
"
,,
5,14,"sit here and look at your ass.
"
,,
5,14,"Yes, I'd rather look at Meg
"
,,
5,14,"toweling off after a shower
"
,,
5,14,"when she does that butt floss thing.
"
,,
5,14,"Ew, ew, that's so disgusting.
"
,,
5,14,"Ugh, ugh, I hope I don't ever
"
,,
5,14,"accidentally use that towel.
"
,,
5,14,"Lois, I have never been more comfortable
"
,,
5,14,"as a person than I am
"
,,
5,14,"in these feety pajamas.
"
,,
5,14,"All warm and furry.
"
,,
5,14,"This is what it feels like to be a bear.
"
,,
5,14,"You remember what I used to say,
"
,,
5,14,"Lois, when we first got married?
"
,,
5,14,"You remember? I used to say :
"
,,
5,14,"""What would it feel like to be a bear?""
"
,,
5,14,"Well, this is it. This is it.
"
,,
5,14," I'm living it, baby.
"
,,
5,14," No, you're not.
"
,,
5,14,"You've been wearing
"
,,
5,14,"those things for three days.
"
,,
5,14,"You can wear them to bed, but
"
,,
5,14,"tomorrow we're getting rid of them.
"
,,
5,14,"Fine.
"
,,
5,14,"Screw up all my fuzziness.
"
,,
5,14,"What the hell was that?
"
,,
5,14,"Oh, my God.
"
,,
5,14,"Lois, don't get alarmed, but
"
,,
5,14,"I think I might be Jesus.
"
,,
5,14,"I'm Jesus.
"
,,
5,14,"Peter, that's a static shock.
"
,,
5,14,"Your pajamas created
"
,,
5,14,"a charge of electricity
"
,,
5,14,"when you dragged your feet
"
,,
5,14,"across the carpet,
"
,,
5,14,"and when you touched Chris,
"
,,
5,14,"you passed it on.
"
,,
5,14,"Kneel before Christ!
"
,,
5,14,"Dad!
"
,,
5,14,"I am not your dad.
"
,,
5,14,"I am Electric Man.
"
,,
5,14,"Damn it, Peter, stop it!
"
,,
5,14,"I got to tell you, you're pissing me off
"
,,
5,14,"worse than when I watched the
"
,,
5,14,"O.J. verdict with my old roommate.
"
,,
5,14,"Orenthal James Simpson,</i>
"
,,
5,14," Yes!
"
,,
5,14," What the hell?!
"
,,
5,14," What?!
"
,,
5,14," What?!
"
,,
5,14," Maybe we should get new roommates.
"
,,
5,14," Yeah, maybe we should.
"
,,
5,14,"Peter.
"
,,
5,14,"I know you're in here.
"
,,
5,14,"Yes, I am, Lois.
"
,,
5,14,"But where?
"
,,
5,14,"Peter, if you shock me,
"
,,
5,14,"I swear to God I'm leaving you.
"
,,
5,14,"You'll have to find me first, Lois.
"
,,
5,14,"Where could I be?
"
,,
5,14,"Well, there's a Quonset hut that
"
,,
5,14,"I've never seen in this room before.
"
,,
5,14," I got to figure you're in there.
"
,,
5,14," How do you know, Lois?
"
,,
5,14,"I could be in that New York
"
,,
5,14,"style magazine kiosk.
"
,,
5,14,"Peter, this all looks very expensive.
"
,,
5,14,"Yes, you might say it was...
"
,,
5,14,"shockingly expensive.
"
,,
5,14,"I'm going to try the Quonset hut.
"
,,
5,14,"I was in the bathroom.
"
,,
5,14,"The hut and the kiosk...
"
,,
5,14,"decoys, Lois, decoys!
"
,,
5,14,"Glen, thank you so much
"
,,
5,14,"for helping me tear up my carpet.
"
,,
5,14,"Well, you know, Lois, I got to confess,
"
,,
5,14,"when you called me I sort of
"
,,
5,14,"misunderstood what you were asking for.
"
,,
5,14,"That's why I rushed over.
"
,,
5,14,"But, uh...
"
,,
5,14,"Well, it's fine, it's fine,
"
,,
5,14,"whatever, I'm happy to help.
"
,,
5,14,"What the hell is this?
"
,,
5,14,"Peter, I've had it with
"
,,
5,14,"all your shocking.
"
,,
5,14,"Since you won't get rid of those
"
,,
5,14,"pajamas, I'm getting rid of the carpets.
"
,,
5,14,"Hey, Lois, you want me to leave
"
,,
5,14,"a little strip in this thing?
"
,,
5,14,"Maybe a lightning bolt, unicorn,
"
,,
5,14,"something like that?
"
,,
5,14," No, I want it all gone, Glen.
"
,,
5,14," All right, we're going Brazilian.
"
,,
5,14,"Hey, what's this?
"
,,
5,14," Some kind of really old coin.
"
,,
5,14," Huh. Let me see that.
"
,,
5,14,"Wait a minute, do you know what this is?
"
,,
5,14,"This is an 18th-century
"
,,
5,14,"Rhode Island ship token.
"
,,
5,14,"This thing's got to be worth 50 grand.
"
,,
5,14,"I can finally afford that operation
"
,,
5,14,"to swap my vocal cords
"
,,
5,14,"with Patrick Stewart.
"
,,
5,14,"Hey, Lois, I spent the afternoon
"
,,
5,14,"making a list of famous Armenians.
"
,,
5,14,"Eric Bogosian, Andre Agassi,
"
,,
5,14,"Jerry ""The Shark"" Tarkanian.
"
,,
5,14,"That is all.
"
,,
5,14,"Peter, you've been sleeping
"
,,
5,14,"with that money for the past week.
"
,,
5,14,"Don't you think it's time
"
,,
5,14,"we did something with it?
"
,,
5,14,"Buy a bolt and shut that trap of yours?
"
,,
5,14," What?
"
,,
5,14," What?
"
,,
5,14,"'Cause I had an idea.
"
,,
5,14,"Remember when we first got married...
"
,,
5,14,"And I said, ""I wonder what it
"
,,
5,14,"would be like to be a bear""?
"
,,
5,14,"No, no, no, I'm talking about
"
,,
5,14,"that dream we had, Peter.
"
,,
5,14,"Remember? We tried
"
,,
5,14,"to open that restaurant,
"
,,
5,14,"and we never quite got it going.
"
,,
5,14,"Yeah, we got shut down
"
,,
5,14,"'cause of my exploding cupcakes.
"
,,
5,14,"Mmm, I hope these taste
"
,,
5,14,"as good as they look.
"
,,
5,14,"Gerald!
"
,,
5,14,"The secret is in the frosting.
"
,,
5,14,"But I'll never tell.
"
,,
5,14,"Well, here's another chance
"
,,
5,14,"to open a restaurant.
"
,,
5,14,"You're right.
"
,,
5,14," And I'll make my special cupcakes.
"
,,
5,14," No, Peter...
"
,,
5,14,"Oh, yeah, right, that was the problem.
"
,,
5,14,"All right, everybody,
"
,,
5,14,"only three hours till opening.
"
,,
5,14,"Oh, this is going to be
"
,,
5,14,"the coolest place in Quahog.
"
,,
5,14,"All the movers and shakers
"
,,
5,14,"and bigwigs are going to eat here...
"
,,
5,14,"but not the small wigs.
"
,,
5,14,"Hey, I'm hungry.
"
,,
5,14,"I got a credit card.
"
,,
5,14,"Oh, God, I'm so nervous.
"
,,
5,14,"I hope it goes well.
"
,,
5,14,"Oh, yes, I'm sure it will go as well
"
,,
5,14,"as Liza Minnelli's Playboy shoot.
"
,,
5,14,"Oh, God, please put
"
,,
5,14,"your clothes back on.
"
,,
5,14,"Mama... Mama...
"
,,
5,14,"Do you love me now, Mama?
"
,,
5,14,"Please love me, Mama!
"
,,
5,14,"Good evening. Welcome to
"
,,
5,14,"Big Pete's House of Munch.
"
,,
5,14," May I help you?
"
,,
5,14," Yes, do you accept the Discover card?
"
,,
5,14,"Hey, Lois, Diamond Jim Brady over here
"
,,
5,14,"just asked if we accept
"
,,
5,14,"the Discover card.
"
,,
5,14,"They're in an exclusive club
"
,,
5,14,"called anybody.
"
,,
5,14,"Yeah.
"
,,
5,14,"No, no, no, I don't think so.
"
,,
5,14,"You know, you know,
"
,,
5,14,"I would rather take two live chickens
"
,,
5,14,"than your fly-by-night credit card.
"
,,
5,14,"I would rather take a jar of pennies
"
,,
5,14,"that's value was less
"
,,
5,14,"than that of your bill.
"
,,
5,14," Look, you don't have to insult me.
"
,,
5,14," No, no, no.
"
,,
5,14,"You are going to sit there
"
,,
5,14,"and listen to the funny things
"
,,
5,14,"I would take instead
"
,,
5,14,"of your credit card.
"
,,
5,14,"The guy at table 7 complained there's
"
,,
5,14,"not enough juice on his prime rib.
"
,,
5,14,"Oh, did he, now?
"
,,
5,14,"Let me take care of that for him.
"
,,
5,14,"Tell him, bon apptit, douchebag.
"
,,
5,14,"Oh, look, it's one of those
"
,,
5,14,"early Maude episodes
"
,,
5,14,"with the really long opening
"
,,
5,14,"credit sequence.
"
,,
5,14,"the whole world looked</i>
"
,,
5,14,"strong woman character</i>
"
,,
5,14,"the soldiers and bandages, too</i>
"
,,
5,14," What the hell?
"
,,
5,14,"with lots of Indian pride</i>
"
,,
5,14,"And then there's Maude?
"
,,
5,14," Aw, come on!
"
,,
5,14,"and professional golf, too</i>
"
,,
5,14,"And then there's Maude!
"
,,
5,14,"when she didn't come back</i>
"
,,
5,14," And then there's Maude! Come on!
"
,,
5,14,"to keep herself looking fine</i>
"
,,
5,14,"There we go!
"
,,
5,14,"That was an ordeal.
"
,,
5,14,"Well, Peter, this has been
"
,,
5,14,"an amazing week.
"
,,
5,14,"You and I own a restaurant.
"
,,
5,14,"Can you believe it?
"
,,
5,14,"I know. I feel like I'm dreaming.
"
,,
5,14,"Wait.
"
,,
5,14,"Maybe I am dreaming.
"
,,
5,14,"That means I can do whatever
"
,,
5,14,"I want without consequences.
"
,,
5,14,"What are you doing?
"
,,
5,14,"I just adopted 30 puppies!
"
,,
5,14,"You guys, I have some bad news.
"
,,
5,14,"I just finished going over the books,
"
,,
5,14,"and this restaurant is
"
,,
5,14,"hemorrhaging money.
"
,,
5,14,"What? Well, how is that possible?
"
,,
5,14,"Isn't it obvious?
"
,,
5,14,"We're not getting enough customers.
"
,,
5,14,"This place is like a
"
,,
5,14,"ghost town half the time.
"
,,
5,14,"Yeah. Maybe somebody
"
,,
5,14,"should have asked me.
"
,,
5,14,"After all, I'm the only one in this
"
,,
5,14,"family with any business experience.
"
,,
5,14,"All right, Violet and Pigpen,
"
,,
5,14,"you've been seeing each other a few
"
,,
5,14,"weeks now. What seems to be the problem?
"
,,
5,14,"I keep getting bladder infections,
"
,,
5,14,"and I don't know why.
"
,,
5,14,"Really?
"
,,
5,14,"You don't know why?
"
,,
5,14,"I don't know what to do, guys.
"
,,
5,14,"The House of Munch is
"
,,
5,14,"going down the tubes.
"
,,
5,14,"Maybe you need to do
"
,,
5,14,"a little advertising, Peter.
"
,,
5,14,"Well, I tried.
"
,,
5,14,"I even hired M. Night Shyamalan
"
,,
5,14,"to direct my TV commercial.
"
,,
5,14,"I have a secret to tell you.
"
,,
5,14," What is it?
"
,,
5,14," Come closer.
"
,,
5,14,"I see good food at competitive prices.
"
,,
5,14,"At Big Pete's House of Munch!
"
,,
5,14,"Stop on by!
"
,,
5,14,"Unfortunately, they couldn't air it,
"
,,
5,14,"'cause it turns out M. Night Shyamalan
"
,,
5,14,"was involved with September 11.
"
,,
5,14,"You know, Peter, my buddies and I
"
,,
5,14,"have been looking for a new hangout.
"
,,
5,14,"Our usual doughnut shop
"
,,
5,14,"has gotten a little...
"
,,
5,14,"Puerto Ricany.
"
,,
5,14,"What if we made your place our new spot?
"
,,
5,14,"Joe, that's a great idea!
"
,,
5,14,"Fantastic! We'll see you tonight.
"
,,
5,14,"This is awesome!
"
,,
5,14,"Bunch of cops in uniform
"
,,
5,14,"hanging out in my restaurant?
"
,,
5,14,"This is going to be cooler
"
,,
5,14,"than that time
"
,,
5,14,"Ben Stiller taught me how to be myself.
"
,,
5,14,"But how can you leave me now,
"
,,
5,14,"Ben Stiller,
"
,,
5,14,"when I need you more than ever?
"
,,
5,14,"I've taught you everything
"
,,
5,14,"you need to know, Peter.
"
,,
5,14,"Now it's time for me
"
,,
5,14,"to go help another child.
"
,,
5,14,"I guess I just fooled myself into
"
,,
5,14,"thinking you'd always be with me.
"
,,
5,14,"I will, Peter.
"
,,
5,14,"I will always be with you.
"
,,
5,14,"His movies are terrible...
"
,,
5,14,"Lois, roll out the red carpet.
"
,,
5,14,"Here comes Joe and his cop buddies.
"
,,
5,14,"You got tables for 30?
"
,,
5,14,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, Joe! I thought you
"
,,
5,14,"were bringing your cop friends over.
"
,,
5,14,"What are all these
"
,,
5,14,"parallelograms doing here?
"
,,
5,14,"You mean paraplegics.
"
,,
5,14,"These are my friends, Peter.
"
,,
5,14,"Come on, guys. Let's eat.
"
,,
5,14,"Oh, God. I hope there's not one of
"
,,
5,14,"those angry, handicapped Vietnam guys
"
,,
5,14,"with the bandana on his head.
"
,,
5,14,"Oh! There he is.
"
,,
5,14,"I've seen some things, man,
"
,,
5,14,"and some stuff.
"
,,
5,14,"I wouldn't recommend it.
"
,,
5,14,"Peter, isn't this wonderful?
"
,,
5,14,"The place is packed.
"
,,
5,14,"Uh... Lois, uh...
"
,,
5,14,"aren't you a little freaked out by this?
"
,,
5,14,"Why? Everybody's having a great time.
"
,,
5,14,"Besides, think of the
"
,,
5,14,"money we're making.
"
,,
5,14,"I don't care about that.
"
,,
5,14,"I wanted a cool restaurant,
"
,,
5,14,"not the cafeteria at the
"
,,
5,14,"veteran's hospital.
"
,,
5,14,"This is weirder than that
"
,,
5,14,"rap video by M.C. Escher.
"
,,
5,14,"and going down the stairs</i>
"
,,
5,14,"and going down the stairs</i>
"
,,
5,14,"And, in local news, a new restaurant
"
,,
5,14,"is taking Quahog by storm.
"
,,
5,14,"That's right, Diane.
"
,,
5,14,"If you're handicapped,
"
,,
5,14,"or know someone who's handicapped, or
"
,,
5,14,"just happen to be a fan of the circus,
"
,,
5,14,"then come on down
"
,,
5,14,"to Big Pete's House of Munch,
"
,,
5,14,"where the elite without feet
"
,,
5,14,"meet to eat.
"
,,
5,14,"Lois, this is insanity. I think we
"
,,
5,14,"should shut down the restaurant.
"
,,
5,14,"But... why? We're doing so well.
"
,,
5,14,"Lois, let me explain something to you,
"
,,
5,14,"all right? Cripples are not cool.
"
,,
5,14," Hang on. I'm going to get the picture.
"
,,
5,14," Oh, Peter, don't...
"
,,
5,14," What do you see here, Lois?
"
,,
5,14," Do we have to...?
"
,,
5,14,"What do you see?!
"
,,
5,14," A picture of Mark Harmon.
"
,,
5,14," A picture of Mark Harmon,
"
,,
5,14,"the greatest actor who ever lived.
"
,,
5,14,"Do you see a wheelchair
"
,,
5,14,"under Mark Harmon?
"
,,
5,14," Peter...
"
,,
5,14," Lois,
"
,,
5,14,"do you...
"
,,
5,14,"see a wheelchair...
"
,,
5,14,"under Mark Harmon?
"
,,
5,14," No.
"
,,
5,14," No, you do not,
"
,,
5,14,"because Mark Harmon is cool.
"
,,
5,14,"I know what you're thinking. ""Peter,
"
,,
5,14,"this is just like your Gil Gerard speech.""
"
,,
5,14,"And you can stop right in
"
,,
5,14,"your tracks, because it is not.
"
,,
5,14,"Granted, it is similar to the
"
,,
5,14,"Gil Gerard speech, but it...
"
,,
5,14,"Peter, I like our restaurant
"
,,
5,14,"the way it is,
"
,,
5,14,"and if you don't, that's your problem.
"
,,
5,14,"Fine. Then I'll deal with this myself.
"
,,
5,14,"All right, here they come.
"
,,
5,14,"Hey, Peter, we're here for dinner.
"
,,
5,14,"Oh no, you're not, Joe.
"
,,
5,14,"We have a new policy.
"
,,
5,14,"Can't you read the sign?
"
,,
5,14,"Peter, what the hell is that all about?
"
,,
5,14,"It's a message, Joe.
"
,,
5,14,"I don't want you and your
"
,,
5,14,"kind eating here anymore.
"
,,
5,14,"You're ruining what was supposed
"
,,
5,14,"to be a cool establishment.
"
,,
5,14,"Peter, you're one of my closest friends.
"
,,
5,14,"Are you... you telling me that you have
"
,,
5,14,"a problem with me being handicapped?
"
,,
5,14,"As a matter of fact, Joe, yes.
"
,,
5,14,"I think it's immoral.
"
,,
5,14,"It's a lifestyle choice
"
,,
5,14,"you're forcing on America.
"
,,
5,14,"We handicapped are a proud people!
"
,,
5,14,"Yeah, when you're not drinking and
"
,,
5,14,"gambling on your reservations,
"
,,
5,14,"which we gave you.
"
,,
5,14,"Fine, if that's the way you want it,
"
,,
5,14,"but we're not going to go down easy.
"
,,
5,14,"Okay, that was easy.
"
,,
5,14,"But I'll be back with
"
,,
5,14,"more handicapped guys!
"
,,
5,14,"Dad, look! Here they come!
"
,,
5,14,"Peter, we'll give you
"
,,
5,14,"one last chance to let us in!
"
,,
5,14,"What are you going to do, Joe?
"
,,
5,14,"I'm up here.
"
,,
5,14,"And you're down there.
"
,,
5,14,"Very well, Peter,
"
,,
5,14,"you leave us no choice.
"
,,
5,14,"Men, form up Crippletron!
"
,,
5,14,"Help! Help! Somebody help me!
"
,,
5,14,"Ben Stiller, help me.
"
,,
5,14,"No, Peter. I heard what
"
,,
5,14,"you said about my movies.
"
,,
5,14,"How did you hear?
"
,,
5,14,"Hello!
"
,,
5,14,"Go to hell, you mutant offspring
"
,,
5,14,"of comedy people.
"
,,
5,14,"Mrs. Griffin, I'm afraid
"
,,
5,14,"he'll never walk again...
"
,,
5,14,"without remembering how lucky he is
"
,,
5,14,"that he'll only be in this
"
,,
5,14,"wheelchair for two weeks.
"
,,
5,14,"That leg should heal up just fine.
"
,,
5,14,"Peter, you do realize you deserve this
"
,,
5,14,"for the way you treated Joe.
"
,,
5,14,"I think you owe him an apology.
"
,,
5,14,"Are you kidding, Lois?
"
,,
5,14,"It ain't my fault that him
"
,,
5,14,"and all his gimpy friends
"
,,
5,14,"don't fit in with regular society.
"
,,
5,14,"But I'm going to be different.
"
,,
5,14,"I'll be a dignified cripple,
"
,,
5,14,"and I'll show them all how it's done!
"
,,
5,14,"before you and me run</i>
"
,,
5,14,"they call it the blues</i>
"
,,
5,14,"they call it the blues.</i>
"
,,
5,14,"Joe, uh...
"
,,
5,14," you got a minute?
"
,,
5,14," What is it, Peter?
"
,,
5,14,"I, uh...
"
,,
5,14,"just wanted to apologize.
"
,,
5,14,"I thought you and your friends
"
,,
5,14,"were just a bunch of gross cripples,
"
,,
5,14,"but I've been in a wheelchair
"
,,
5,14,"for 45 minutes now,
"
,,
5,14,"and I see how tough it is.
"
,,
5,14,"Well, Peter, it's been a
"
,,
5,14,"rough week for both of us,
"
,,
5,14,"but it means a lot to me
"
,,
5,14,"to hear you say that.
"
,,
5,14,"So what do you say?
"
,,
5,14,"Can we put all this behind us?
"
,,
5,14,"I'd like nothing better.
"
,,
5,14,"Hey, Bonnie and I are watching
"
,,
5,14,"Grey's Anatomy if you want to come in.
"
,,
5,14,"Oh, boy, Joe, I...
"
,,
5,14,"I got to tell you, that... that...
"
,,
5,14,"that sounds awful.

"
,,
5,15,"My character is a therapist
"

5,15,"living in the city,
"

5,15,"but I'm married to an elephant.
"

5,15,"Hi, I'm the husband.
"

5,15,"Hey, honey.
"
,,
5,15,"We're going to my parents' this weekend.
"
,,
5,15,"Did you pack your trunk?
"
,,
5,15,"I don't think I want to go.
"
,,
5,15,"I don't like going to your parents.
"
,,
5,15,"Why?
"
,,
5,15,"Maybe because your dad's
"
,,
5,15,"an ivory hunter?
"
,,
5,15,"See, there's a lot going on here.
"

5,15,"A lot going on.
"

5,15,"It actually, it actually
"

5,15,"gets pretty watchable.
"

5,15,"Ah, damn, it's still raining.
"

5,15,"Lois, you mind if I
"

5,15,"go in the house?
"
,,
5,15,"Fine, fine, just put
"
,,
5,15,"the newspaper down.
"
,,
5,15,"Hey, Lois, look at this.
"
,,
5,15,"The church is holding auditions
"
,,
5,15,"for a new organist.
"
,,
5,15,"Really? Wow, you know, that sounds
"
,,
5,15,"like it could be a lot of fun.
"
,,
5,15,"Yeah, it's been a while since
"
,,
5,15,"you've had the chance to play in public.
"
,,
5,15,"Church organist?
"
,,
5,15,"Ah, that's boring.
"
,,
5,15,"Why don't you do something
"
,,
5,15,"more interesting?
"
,,
5,15,"Like when I had that job
"
,,
5,15,"feeding the homeless.
"
,,
5,15,"That's going to make you big and strong.
"
,,
5,15,"Burping time.
"
,,
5,15,"Oh, smells like someone
"
,,
5,15,"needs to be changed.
"
,,
5,15,"When was the last time you were changed,
"
,,
5,15,"seven days ago?
"
,,
5,15,"That's one week.
"
,,
5,15,"There are seven days in a week.
"
,,
5,15,"I love you, filthy hobo.
"

5,15,"Huh, huh! All right.
"
,,
5,15,"Why do you say ""organist""
"

5,15,"if you don't want...
"
,,
5,15,"I don't understand

"
,,
5,15,"oh, what a thrill</i>
"
,,
5,15,"great balls of fire.</i>
"
,,
5,15,"All right, up next is Lois Griffin.
"
,,
5,15,"Well, I don't know if I can compete
"
,,
5,15,"with the rest of these people,
"
,,
5,15,"but here goes.
"
,,
5,15,"My word, what a fascinating man
"
,,
5,15,"this Jesus must have been.
"
,,
5,15,"I can just imagine meeting him.
"
,,
5,15,"That was beautiful,Mrs. Griffin.
"
,,
5,15,"Up next is Jake Tucker.
"
,,
5,15,"Well, finally! Some of us have been
"
,,
5,15,"waiting all evening for a certain wife
"
,,
5,15,"to come home and feed
"
,,
5,15,"her starving family.
"
,,
5,15,"Peter, I told you I was going to be late.
"
,,
5,15,"Couldn't you have handled dinner?
"
,,
5,15,"You can't ask me to make dinner, Lois.
"
,,
5,15,"That's like asking me to choose
"
,,
5,15,"between Sarah Jessica Parker
"
,,
5,15,"and Kirsten Dunst in a
"
,,
5,15,"hotbody/weird face contest.
"
,,
5,15,"It can't be done.
"
,,
5,15,"Well, I've got good news.
"
,,
5,15,"I'm going to be the church's
"
,,
5,15,"new organist.
"
,,
5,15," Hey, congrats.
"
,,
5,15," Wow, Mom, that's great.
"
,,
5,15,"That means you'll play the organ.
"
,,
5,15,"It also means that this family is going to
"
,,
5,15,"start going to church again on Sundays.
"
,,
5,15,"Being there today reminded me
"
,,
5,15,"of how important religious services
"
,,
5,15,"are to the moral fiber of a family.
"
,,
5,15,"And lately, this family has been
"
,,
5,15,"lacking moral fiber.
"
,,
5,15,"Especially you, Meg.
"
,,
5,15,"Meg, what happened to you?
"
,,
5,15,"She can't answer you.
"
,,
5,15,"She can't even talk.
"
,,
5,15,"Ever since she started smoking pot,
"
,,
5,15,"she just kind of lays there.
"
,,
5,15,"It's really sad.
"
,,
5,15,"And a tiny bit funny.
"
,,
5,15,"Oh, my God, I think I'm getting
"
,,
5,15,"a contact high.
"
,,
5,15,"Oh, now I'm messed up, too.
"
,,
5,15,"Good morning, everyone.
"
,,
5,15,"A reading from the letter of John

5,15,"Youse is good church going folk.
"

5,15,"Give me that!

,,
5,15,"Well, aren't you
"
,,
5,15,"an enthusiastic wafer muncher.
"
,,
5,15," What is that, punch?
"
,,
5,15," Oh, don't y'all drink that.
"
,,
5,15,"Youse gonna get sick.
"
,,
5,15,"Yep.
"
,,
5,15," That baby just threw up the host!
"
,,
5,15," That's a sign of the devil.
"
,,
5,15," Oh, my God,is he possessed?
"
,,
5,15," He's possessed!
"
,,
5,15,"That baby is possessed by Satan!
"
,,
5,15,"Calm down, everyone.
"
,,
5,15,"He's just a little sick.
"
,,
5,15,"I'll take him home.Come on, sweetie.
"
,,
5,15,"Oh, sweet, weare out of here.
"
,,
5,15,"Now I can do what I planned
"
,,
5,15,"to do this morning...
"
,,
5,15,"Gladiator mice.
"
,,
5,15,"Yes, yes, die, die, die!
"
,,
5,15,"I have everything,and you have nothing!
"
,,
5,15,"Ugh, what a horrible morning.
"
,,
5,15,"You know, all I wanted was for us to share
"
,,
5,15,"a simple Sunday church service as a family.
"
,,
5,15,"But I guess that's too much to ask.
"
,,
5,15,"Good afternoon, Mrs. Griffin.
"
,,
5,15,"We're here to take custody of your baby
"
,,
5,15,"so that the good reverend here
"
,,
5,15,"can perform an exorcism and banish
"
,,
5,15,"the devil from his infant soul.
"
,,
5,15,"What?! You are not performing
"
,,
5,15,"an exorcism on my baby.
"
,,
5,15,"Mrs. Griffin,you can give him to us,
"
,,
5,15,"or we can take him by force.
"
,,
5,15," No!
"
,,
5,15," Don't worry, Lois,
"
,,
5,15,"we'll hide in the one place they can't find us.
"
,,
5,15,"In Imagination Land,
"
,,
5,15,"where you burp where you fart,
"
,,
5,15,"and you fart where you burp.
"
,,
5,15,"Indeed, that's how it happens.
"
,,
5,15,"Where are we going?
"
,,
5,15,"Who cares as long as it's away
"
,,
5,15,"from those bloody church fanatics.
"
,,
5,15,"We're going to Texas.
"
,,
5,15,"We can stay at my sister Carol's
"
,,
5,15,"place until this blows over.
"
,,
5,15,"Texas? We're going to Texas
"
,,
5,15,"in search of religious tolerance?
"
,,
5,15,"That's going to be like trying to get
"
,,
5,15,"Sneakers O'Toole to take his sneakers off.
"
,,
5,15,"I'm not taking my sneakers off
"
,,
5,15,"I am Sneakers O'Toole.
"
,,
5,15,"Hey, take those sneakers off.
"
,,
5,15," No!
"
,,
5,15," Take them off, I said!
"
,,
5,15,"No!
"
,,
5,15,"Ah, let him go.
"
,,
5,15,"We'll never catch him.
"
,,
5,15,"Not in these shoes.
"
,,
5,15,"I'm not taking my sneakers off
"
,,
5,15,"I am Sneakers O'Toole.

5,15," Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.
"
,,
5,15," And I'm Diane Simmons.
"
,,
5,15,"Authorities are on the look out for
"
,,
5,15,"one-year-old Stewie Griffin,
"
,,
5,15,"a Quahog infant who is believed
"
,,
5,15,"to be possessed by Satan.
"
,,
5,15,"A substantial reward is being offered for
"
,,
5,15,"any information leading to his capture.
"
,,
5,15,"In other pseudo-scientific news,
"
,,
5,15,"a local man claims to have spotted bigfoot.
"
,,
5,15,"We've got the exclusive interview.
"
,,
5,15,"I was about to bone my girlfriend
"
,,
5,15,"out at the lake,
"
,,
5,15,"but suddenly she yelled,
"
,,
5,15,"so I looked up
"
,,
5,15,"and it was bigfoot.
"
,,
5,15," So what happened next?
"
,,
5,15," Then I went back to bone her,
"
,,
5,15,"but the mosquitoes were going crazy,
"
,,
5,15,"and she said there was no way.
"
,,
5,15,"All right, get your snacks
"
,,
5,15,"and hurry out, you guys.
"
,,
5,15,"Yeah, look, they have Chunky bars.
"
,,
5,15,"What a God-awful mess those things are,
"
,,
5,15,"chocolate with raisins in it.
"
,,
5,15,"Yeah, yeah, that's what kids
"
,,
5,15,"want with their chocolate-- fruit.
"
,,
5,15,"Why don't you put sunflower seeds
"
,,
5,15,"in the Ding Dongs while you're at it?
"
,,
5,15," Is that part of your stand-up act?
"
,,
5,15," I don't know, do you like it?
"
,,
5,15,"I wouldn't open with it.
"
,,
5,15,"Pardon me, sir.
"
,,
5,15,"We're trying to locate a possessed child.
"
,,
5,15,"Have you seen anyone
"
,,
5,15,"who looks like this?
"
,,
5,15,"Yeah, that's my son.
"
,,
5,15,"He's actually inthe mini-mart right now.
"
,,
5,15,"He'll be out in a second.
"
,,
5,15,"I-I-I-I mean, I mean no, no.
"
,,
5,15,"Never seen him before.
"
,,
5,15,"Hmm. What was that first thing you said?
"
,,
5,15,"Oh, I was just saying that baby
"
,,
5,15,"in the picture is my son.
"
,,
5,15,"He's traveling with us.
"
,,
5,15,"He's part of our family.
"
,,
5,15,"We're trying to avoid being
"
,,
5,15,"found by police like you.
"
,,
5,15,"I mean, I was just remarking
"
,,
5,15,"what a nice tie you have on.
"
,,
5,15,"I love this tie.
"
,,
5,15,"All right, you folks take care now.
"
,,
5,15,"Oh, did you hear that cashier's accent?
"
,,
5,15,"""Would you like some change
"
,,
5,15,"please for you?""
"
,,
5,15,"Oh, you know, if it weren't for 9/11,
"
,,
5,15,"those guys would be adorable.
"
,,
5,15,"Oh, my God, look.
"
,,
5,15,"Quick, into the bathroom.
"
,,
5,15,"We're going to have to come up with a way
"
,,
5,15,"to change your appearance.
"
,,
5,15,"Well, I could disguise myself as Britney Spears.
"
,,
5,15,"I'm already standing in urine,
"
,,
5,15,"and I hate the person I'm with.
"
,,
5,15,"No, see, there's got to be something
"
,,
5,15,"in here we can use.
"
,,
5,15,"Boy, that was a close one back there.
"
,,
5,15,"Way to think on your feet, Brian.
"
,,
5,15,"We got lucky.
"
,,
5,15,"How you holding up, Stewie?
"
,,
5,15,"Um...
"
,,
5,15,"I feel right, Brian.
"
,,
5,15,"I feel right.
"
,,
5,15,"Are you sure Aunt Carol won't mind us using her house?
"
,,
5,15,"She won't care, Chris.
"
,,
5,15,"She's off on her ninth honeymoon.
"
,,
5,15,"When will it work for her?
"
,,
5,15,"Howdy, new neighbors.
"
,,
5,15," Pleased to welcome you.
"
,,
5,15," We're the Lynches.
"
,,
5,15,"We live next door.
"
,,
5,15,"Nice to meet you.
"
,,
5,15,"We're the Griffins.
"
,,
5,15,"Nellie here is a homemaker.
"
,,
5,15,"And I'm a queer chaser and beater.
"
,,
5,15,"Lois, I'm not sure this is the right place for us.
"
,,
5,15,"These Texans are socially backward and,
"
,,
5,15,"politically, they're all
"
,,
5,15,"stubborn as a mule.
"
,,
5,15,"Nope, sorry, Kevin Bacon
"
,,
5,15,"wasn't in Footloose.
"
,,
5,15," What ? Of course he was.
"
,,
5,15," No, he wasn't. You lose.
"
,,
5,15," Of course he was, he was the star.
"
,,
5,15," No, you're wrong. Look it up.
"
,,
5,15,"I don't have to look it up.
"
,,
5,15,"It's common knowledge.
"
,,
5,15," He was on the cover of...Nope.
"
,,
5,15," Nope.
"
,,
5,15," People magazine when the movie...
"
,,
5,15," Nope. No. No.
"
,,
5,15," Everyone knows Kevin Bacon
"
,,
5,15," No, no, No, No!
"
,,
5,15," was the star of Footloose.
"
,,
5,15," No! No! No!
"
,,
5,15,"No! No! No! No!
"
,,
5,15,"Hyan! Hyan!
"
,,
5,15,"Look what the Lynches gave us.
"
,,
5,15,"A needle point of Chuck Norris
"
,,
5,15,"from Walker, Texas Ranger.
"
,,
5,15,"You know, they say Chuck Norris is so tough
"
,,
5,15,"there's no chin under his beard.
"
,,
5,15," There is only another fist.
"
,,
5,15," That's ridiculous.
"
,,
5,15,"Chuck Norris ?
"
,,
5,15,"You know, this place may be the upside
"
,,
5,15,"to everything that's happened.
"
,,
5,15,"The people are kind and generous.
"
,,
5,15,"They seem whole some and moral.
"
,,
5,15,"Exactly the kind of influence
"
,,
5,15,"this family needs.
"
,,
5,15,"Lois, we're living in a red state
"
,,
5,15,"with a bunch of right-wing nutjobs.
"
,,
5,15,"Hey, Chris, check out my belt buckle.
"
,,
5,15,"It says, ""Everything's bigger in Texas.""
"
,,
5,15,"Belts are a great way
"
,,
5,15,"to express opinions.
"
,,
5,15,"Texas, with Duke Dillon.</i>
"
,,
5,15,"Howdy, Texas.
"
,,
5,15,"I'm Duke Dillon.
"
,,
5,15,"At the top of the news tonight,
"
,,
5,15,"authorities have called off their pursuit
"
,,
5,15,"of a fugitive Rhode Island baby
"
,,
5,15,"who was thought
"
,,
5,15,"to be possessed by the devil.
"
,,
5,15,"Oh! Thank God!
"
,,
5,15,"This turn of events came
"
,,
5,15,"after Vatican scientists
"
,,
5,15,"announced today that the devil is not
"
,,
5,15,"the greatest threat to salvation
"
,,
5,15,"due to last week's discovery
"
,,
5,15,"of the Superdevil.
"
,,
5,15,"Religion reporter Dallas Houston has the story.
"
,,
5,15,"Thanks, Duke.
"
,,
5,15,"Well, let me try and give you a clear
"
,,
5,15,"picture of what we're dealing with here.
"
,,
5,15,"Here's a photo of the devil,
"
,,
5,15,"and here's the Superdevil.
"
,,
5,15,"Now, as you can see, there are
"
,,
5,15,"some significant differences.
"
,,
5,15,"The Superdevil is at least
"
,,
5,15,"six inches taller,
"
,,
5,15,"he has a flying motorcycle
"
,,
5,15,"and a jar of marmalade
"
,,
5,15,"that we believe forces you
"
,,
5,15,"to commit adultery.
"
,,
5,15,"Thanks a lot, Dallas.
"
,,
5,15,"Looks like we all got something
"
,,
5,15,"new to be afraid of.
"
,,
5,15,"Everyone, it's over!
"
,,
5,15,"We can go back to Quahog.
"
,,
5,15,"Hey, Lois, you say something?
"
,,
5,15,"Aw, just that I think you're going to love this cake.
"
,,
5,15,"None for me, thanks.
"
,,
5,15,"It's going to go straight to my vagina.
"
,,
5,15,"That's what girls worry about,
"
,,
5,15,"right, having big vaginas?
"
,,
5,15,"Dad, why aren't you taking the car?
"
,,
5,15,"Chris, we're in Texas now.
"
,,
5,15,"If I'm not riding a horse,
"
,,
5,15,"I'm going to stick out like a straight guy
"
,,
5,15,"in a figure-skating competition.
"
,,
5,15,"Boo-ya! Triple salchow in your face!
"
,,
5,15,"Hey, you want this? Huh?
"
,,
5,15,"You want some of this?
"
,,
5,15,"Oh, man, look at your rack.
"
,,
5,15,"I'd motorboat that.
"
,,
5,15,"I'd motorboat the hell out of it!
"
,,
5,15,"Right after this layback spin.
"
,,
5,15,"Bottle of Jack Daniels, please.
"
,,
5,15," There you go.
"
,,
5,15," Thanks.
"
,,
5,15,"What's this?
"
,,
5,15,"That's your gun.
"
,,
5,15,"Buy some liquor,get a free gun.
"
,,
5,15,"Is that like a special you have
"
,,
5,15,"on now or something?
"
,,
5,15,"Nope. Texas state law.
"
,,
5,15,"You have a nice day now.
"
,,
5,15,"State law?
"
,,
5,15,"God! This place officially sucks
"
,,
5,15,"worse than the WNBA.
"
,,
5,15,"And, at the top of the second half,
"
,,
5,15,"it's 16 to nine.
"
,,
5,15,"Easton leads the scoring with four.
"
,,
5,15,"And that's why she commands
"
,,
5,15,"$7,000 a year.
"
,,
5,15,"These gals sure do
"
,,
5,15,"make it look difficult.
"
,,
5,15,"But is having this minor skill
"
,,
5,15,"worth being so unattractive?
"
,,
5,15,"That's for the fan to decide.
"
,,
5,15,"Yay!
"
,,
5,15,"Huh. That was kind of cool.
"
,,
5,15,"Been a long day, Lois.
"
,,
5,15,"Long day.
"
,,
5,15,"Peter, what the hell?
"
,,
5,15,"You can't bring that horse into our bed.
"
,,
5,15,"Lois, I cannot believe you would
"
,,
5,15,"ban the horse from our bed.
"
,,
5,15,"He is a graceful, majestic creature
"
,,
5,15,"who is a part of this family
"
,,
5,15,"and only wants you to love and respect...
"
,,
5,15,"The horse may have pooped in the bed.
"
,,
5,15,"I hereby call this meeting
"
,,
5,15,"of the Texas Youth Club to order.
"
,,
5,15,"First, I'd like to welcome
"
,,
5,15,"our two newcomers,
"
,,
5,15,"Chris and Meg Griffin.
"
,,
5,15,"Wow! This is the coolest club
"
,,
5,15,"I've ever been in.
"
,,
5,15,"Well, you're not quite in the club yet.
"
,,
5,15,"You got to pass the initiation.
"
,,
5,15,"What do we have to do?
"
,,
5,15,"You got to sneak on
"
,,
5,15,"to the Crawford Ranch
"
,,
5,15,"and steal a pair of
"
,,
5,15,"George Bush's underwear.
"
,,
5,15,"And then bring it back here
"
,,
5,15,"so we can bask inits Bushy goodness.
"
,,
5,15,"Boy, that's even kinkier than the porn
"
,,
5,15,"they make for senior citizens.
"
,,
5,15,"Can I help you, Edward?
"
,,
5,15,"Yeah. I'm here for the early bird special.
"
,,
5,15," Are those new slacks?
"
,,
5,15," What's that, now?
"
,,
5,15," Are those new slacks?
"
,,
5,15," I got these on special at Caldors.
"
,,
5,15," Who drove you there?
"
,,
5,15," My nephew.
"
,,
5,15,"Oh. That was nice of him.
"
,,
5,15,"I forgot why I came over.
"
,,
5,15,"Are those new slacks?
"
,,
5,15,"What is this? What the hell
"
,,
5,15,"are we doing here?
"
,,
5,15,"Welcome to your first
"
,,
5,15,"toddler pageant, Stewie.
"
,,
5,15,"It's what you do when you're in Texas.
"
,,
5,15,"Oh, lovely.
"
,,
5,15,"A first-class ticket to a semen-stained
"
,,
5,15,"death in the basement.
"
,,
5,15,"Why don't you meet the other contestants
"
,,
5,15,"while I go register you?
"
,,
5,15,"Hello. I'm, uh... Stephanie Griffin.
"
,,
5,15," Hi, Stephanie.
"
,,
5,15," What's your talent?
"
,,
5,15,"I sing, I do gymnastics, and I can play
"
,,
5,15,"seven instruments at the same time.
"
,,
5,15,"Hmm. You could be a threat to me.
"
,,
5,15,"Chuck.
"
,,
5,15,"There it is... the Crawford Ranch.
"
,,
5,15,"I can't believe we're actually doing this.
"
,,
5,15,"What a bonding adventure for the two of us.
"
,,
5,15,"Settle down, Meg.
"
,,
5,15,"Okay, I see Old Man Cheney
"
,,
5,15,"guarding the place.
"
,,
5,15,"I'll give you 18% of my foot in your ass.
"
,,
5,15,"I'd like you to meet
"
,,
5,15,"my daughter's husband Michael.
"
,,
5,15,"Wow! Look how organized he is.
"
,,
5,15,"He's already got his sugar cut up into neat
"
,,
5,15,"little lines for his breakfast tomorrow.
"
,,
5,15,"And a razor blade to shave.
"
,,
5,15,"Wow! Look at this.
"
,,
5,15,"I can't believe Mrs. Bush kept
"
,,
5,15,"all these Planned Parenthood receipts.
"
,,
5,15,"Holy cow! She's been scraped more times
"
,,
5,15,"than a fisherman's knuckle.
"
,,
5,15,"Hey, what are you kids doing here?
"
,,
5,15,"You tell Javier to back off.
"
,,
5,15,"I'll have his money by next week.
"
,,
5,15," What?
"
,,
5,15," Nevermind
"
,,
5,15,"Hey, you guys want to see something?
"
,,
5,15,"Grab a beer and follow me.
"
,,
5,15,"See this car?
"
,,
5,15,"I restored it myself this summer.
"
,,
5,15,"I was here for 12 weeks. I had to do something.
"
,,
5,15,"But, along the way,
"
,,
5,15,"I learned about honesty, integrity,
"
,,
5,15,"and cold filtered Miller Genuine Draft.
"
,,
5,15,"That's an adult beverage right there.
"
,,
5,15,"You understand
"
,,
5,15,"what I'm trying to say to you?
"
,,
5,15,"Yes. But I have just one question.
"
,,
5,15,"Can I borrow your underpants
"
,,
5,15,"for ten minutes?
"
,,
5,15,"Hello.
"
,,
5,15," Oh. Hi, Jillian.
"
,,
5,15," Brian, I'm reading TV Guide.
"
,,
5,15,"Can you explain how these cheers
"
,,
5,15,"and jeers work again?
"
,,
5,15,"Well, the cheers is when they generally
"
,,
5,15,"approve of something on television,
"
,,
5,15,"and jeers is when
"
,,
5,15,"they find some sort of fault with it.
"
,,
5,15,"Oh. See... yeah, I'm not quite...
"
,,
5,15,"We can't do this over the phone.
"
,,
5,15,"You're going to have to come over.
"
,,
5,15,"I can't come over. We're still on the run
"
,,
5,15,"because the town thinks Stewie's possessed.
"
,,
5,15,"No, they don't. Didn't you hear?
"
,,
5,15,"They stopped chasing you weeks ago.
"
,,
5,15," What? I have to go.
"
,,
5,15," Wait, wait! I have another question.
"
,,
5,15,"How do I know if I'm Jewish?
"
,,
5,15," Are you Jewish?
"
,,
5,15," No
"
,,
5,15," There you go, sport.
"
,,
5,15," Thank you.
"
,,
5,15,"Hey, guys, thanks so much
"
,,
5,15,"for inviting me out today.
"
,,
5,15,"I'm psyched to brand my first cow.
"
,,
5,15,"Here you are, Peter.
"
,,
5,15,"All fired up and ready to go.
"
,,
5,15,"Oh...!
"
,,
5,15,"Oh, yes!
"
,,
5,15,"Yes! Oh...!
"
,,
5,15,"Oh, hang on a second.
"
,,
5,15,"Man, Texas is great.
"
,,
5,15,"Back where I'm from, a retarded guy
"
,,
5,15,"could never have this much fun.
"
,,
5,15," What did you just say?
"
,,
5,15," What?
"
,,
5,15,"Technically, I'm retarded.
"
,,
5,15,"Fellas! Fellas! Can't we talk this over?
"
,,
5,15,"Talking is for terrorists and blacks.
"
,,
5,15,"In Texas, we execute the retarded.
"
,,
5,15,"Oh, my God! So this is how it ends?
"
,,
5,15,"I always thought I'd die having to sit
"
,,
5,15,"through the Canadian Film Festival.
"
,,
5,15,"I don't wish to cause you
"
,,
5,15,"any harm,
"
,,
5,15,"and I won't.
"
,,
5,15,"The end.
"
,,
5,15,"Horsey, you saved my life.
"
,,
5,15,"No problem, Peter. Glad to help out.
"
,,
5,15,"Wow! Gilbert Gottfried.
"
,,
5,15," That's right!
"
,,
5,15," Awesome.
"
,,
5,15,"Now the final contestant for our
"
,,
5,15,"talent portion of the competition,
"
,,
5,15,"Stephanie Griffin.
"
,,
5,15,"Thank you, thank you.
"
,,
5,15,"Hey, what's the deal
"
,,
5,15,"with Chunky bars, huh?
"
,,
5,15,"Chocolate with raisins in it?
"
,,
5,15,"Yeah, that's what kids want with their chocolate-- fruit.
"
,,
5,15,"Wow, that bit is killing.
"
,,
5,15,"Hey, Lois, great news.
"
,,
5,15,"We can go back to Quahog.
"
,,
5,15,"I know, Brian. Shh!
"
,,
5,15,"We're about to see if Stewie won.
"
,,
5,15,"Wait a minute. You know?
"
,,
5,15," How long have you known?
"
,,
5,15," A few weeks. Who cares?
"
,,
5,15,"Wait a minute. You...
"
,,
5,15,"you've known for weeks,
"
,,
5,15,"and you've been lying
"
,,
5,15,"about having to stay here?
"
,,
5,15,"Brian, don't you see?
"
,,
5,15,"This is a wholesome
"
,,
5,15,"community with real values.
"
,,
5,15,"And our firstrunner-up is...
"
,,
5,15,"Miss Dixie-Ann Thomas.
"
,,
5,15,"Which means that Miss Stephanie Griffin
"
,,
5,15,"is our new Little Miss Texas!
"
,,
5,15,"Oh! Oh, my God!
"
,,
5,15,"Oh, I never expected this.
"
,,
5,15,"Oh, I'm so, so honored.
"
,,
5,15,"Hey, that's not a girl!
"
,,
5,15,"It's Enrico Palazzo!
"
,,
5,15,"No, it's not!It's one of them queerosexuals!
"
,,
5,15,"Get him!
"
,,
5,15,"Quick! Get on!
"
,,
5,15," Thank you for all your help.
"
,,
5,15," My pleasure, Peter. Anytime.
"
,,
5,15,"Oh, fantastic.
"
,,
5,15,"Hey, do you still do stand-up?
"
,,
5,15," I do. I'm still touring.
"
,,
5,15," Oh, wow. Can we get tickets?
"
,,
5,15,"Absolutely. I'm in Atlanta next week.
"
,,
5,15,"Great. Oh, well,this will be fun.
"
,,
5,15,"It is so good to be home.
"
,,
5,15,"You know, I wanted us to live
"
,,
5,15,"in a place with real family values.
"
,,
5,15,"But values don't come from where
"
,,
5,15,"you live or who your friends are.
"
,,
5,15,"They come from inside,
"
,,
5,15,"from your own beliefs.
"
,,
5,15,"I agree, Lois.
"
,,
5,15,"Like, for instance,
"
,,
5,15,"if you're watching a TV show and
"
,,
5,15,"you decide to take your values from that,
"
,,
5,15,"you're an idiot.
"
,,
5,15,"Maybe you should take responsibility
"
,,
5,15,"for what values your kids are getting.
"
,,
5,15,"Maybe you shouldn't be letting your kids
"
,,
5,15,"watch certain shows in the first place
"
,,
5,15,"if you have such a big problem with them,
"
,,
5,15,"instead of blaming the shows themselves.
"
,,
5,15,"Yeah

5,16,"to How I Met Your Father.
"
,,
5,16,"Oh, Barney, I'm never going to meet
"
,,
5,16,"the right girl and get married.
"
,,
5,16,"You know, Ted, don't you think
"
,,
5,16,"it's kinda strange for a guy in his 20s
"
,,
5,16,"to always be talking about getting
"
,,
5,16,"married rather than getting laid?
"
,,
5,16,"Barney,
"
,,
5,16,"I'm in love with you.
"
,,
5,16,"Suit up.
"
,,
5,16,"All right, come on, everyone.
"
,,
5,16,"Go get dressed. It's ballet night.
"
,,
5,16,"Lois, don't freakin'
"
,,
5,16,"put me through this again.
"
,,
5,16,"Peter, a little culture
"
,,
5,16,"is good for this family.
"
,,
5,16,"Besides, you liked
"
,,
5,16,"The Nutcracker, didn't you?
"
,,
5,16,"No, Lois, I did not.
"
,,
5,16,"The Nutcracker
"
,,
5,16,"had zero physical comedy.
"
,,
5,16,"And with a name like
"
,,
5,16,"The Nutcracker I thought,
"
,,
5,16,"""Oh, this will be worth
"
,,
5,16,"a few yuks,"" but no, Lois,
"
,,
5,16,"that title wrote a check that those
"
,,
5,16,"queers on stage refused to cash.
"
,,
5,16,"Peter, we're going.
"
,,
5,16,"Well, we're not the first people
"
,,
5,16,"to be dragged off against our will.
"
,,
5,16," Are we there yet?
"
,,
5,16," No!
"
,,
5,16," Are we there yet?
"
,,
5,16," No!
"
,,
5,16,"Are we there yet?
"
,,
5,16,"Damn it! I swear to God
"
,,
5,16,"I will turn this ship around!
"
,,
5,16," That works. - It'll teach us a lesson.
"
,,
5,16," Yeah, that's even better.
"
,,
5,16,"All right, if that's what you...
"
,,
5,16,"Wait a minute!
"
,,
5,16,"You know, Meg, female ballet dancers
"
,,
5,16,"are famous for anorexia and bulimia.
"
,,
5,16,"And, uh, it seems
"
,,
5,16,"to work out for them, so...
"
,,
5,16,"hintity, hint-hint.
"
,,
5,16,"Boy, this is gonna be long.
"
,,
5,16,"So, uh, you kids develop any good
"
,,
5,16,"pot connections at your school yet?
"
,,
5,16," What? - Yeah.
"
,,
5,16," Ah.
"
,,
5,16,"Lois, we'll be right back.
"
,,
5,16,"Meg's gonna take me outside to poop.
"
,,
5,16,"Hey, Quagmire.
"
,,
5,16,"I'm stuck at the stupid ballet.
"
,,
5,16," Yeah.
"
,,
5,16," So am I.
"
,,
5,16,"What?
"
,,
5,16,"by this broad I'm trying to screw.</i>
"
,,
5,16,"Where you sitting?
"
,,
5,16,"balcony. I can see you.</i>
"
,,
5,16,"Oh, my God! What do we do?!
"
,,
5,16,"What do we do?! We're both here.
"
,,
5,16,"Oh, my God! We should text each other!
"
,,
5,16,"Hang up! Hang up!
"
,,
5,16,"Chris, how many times have I told you
"
,,
5,16,"no reading during meals?
"
,,
5,16,"I have a history test today, Mom,
"
,,
5,16,"and I couldn't study last night
"
,,
5,16,"because you made us go to the ballet.
"
,,
5,16,"Well, Chris, you're not gonna learn any history from this.
"
,,
5,16,"This textbook is from 1948.
"
,,
5,16," What?
"
,,
5,16," Chapter 3:
"
,,
5,16,"""Youth culture rebels with
"
,,
5,16,"Big Band music.""
"
,,
5,16,"Let me see that.
"
,,
5,16,"""Israel, the brand-new country
"
,,
5,16,"everyone's gonna love.""
"
,,
5,16,"What the hell? Are the schools
"
,,
5,16,"so underfunded
"
,,
5,16,"that they can't afford text books
"
,,
5,16,"from this century?
"
,,
5,16,"Well, I am going to raise hell about this
"
,,
5,16,"at the next PTA meeting.
"
,,
5,16,"Well, let me know if you need help.
"
,,
5,16,"I can be very persuasive.
"
,,
5,16,"I gave the next speech after
"
,,
5,16,"the Braveheart guy.
"
,,
5,16,"They can take our lives,
"
,,
5,16,"but they can never take
"
,,
5,16,"our freedom!
"
,,
5,16,"And... and...
"
,,
5,16,"Let's not forget the tax
"
,,
5,16,"they levied on properties
"
,,
5,16,"that are in abutment of church lands.
"
,,
5,16,"So, yeah, let's do it.
"
,,
5,16,"All right, let's get
"
,,
5,16,"this meeting underway.
"
,,
5,16,"For our first order of business,
"
,,
5,16,"we'll go to Bruce.
"
,,
5,16,"Well, hey, y'all said my name.
"
,,
5,16,"Welcome to our meeting
"
,,
5,16,"here at the school.
"
,,
5,16,"We got lots of exciting
"
,,
5,16,"topics here tonight.
"
,,
5,16,"We gonna have a puppet show.
"
,,
5,16,"We gonna have some jazz.
"
,,
5,16,"No, I'm just kidding.
"
,,
5,16,"We have some business
"
,,
5,16,"to take care of, though.
"
,,
5,16,"I'm sorry I pulled y'all's legs.
"
,,
5,16,"I'm just a little excited
"
,,
5,16,"'cause I met somebody today.
"
,,
5,16,"Someone in the bookstore.
"
,,
5,16,"Someone who likes the same
"
,,
5,16,"kind of literature as I do.
"
,,
5,16,"Oh, and the adventure begins again.
"
,,
5,16,"Excuse me, Principal Shepherd
"
,,
5,16,"There's something I'd like to discuss.
"
,,
5,16,"The school has gone too far
"
,,
5,16,"with these budget cuts.
"
,,
5,16,"I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin,
"
,,
5,16,"but the ""No Child Left Behind"" law
"
,,
5,16,"cost us our federal funding because
"
,,
5,16,"our students' test scores were too low.
"
,,
5,16,"They cut a school's funding
"
,,
5,16,"if it's got low test scores?
"
,,
5,16,"This is not what the founding
"
,,
5,16,"fathers had in mind.
"
,,
5,16,"Okay, we're here to sign
"
,,
5,16,"this declaration of our independence.
"
,,
5,16,"Let's take roll call first.
"
,,
5,16," Thomas Jefferson?
"
,,
5,16," Benjamin Franklin.
"
,,
5,16," John Footpenis?
"
,,
5,16," <i>It's Hancock now.</i>
"
,,
5,16," Why?
"
,,
5,16,"Well, somehow this school needs
"
,,
5,16,"to raise its test scores right away.
"
,,
5,16,"I suppose there is one thing I can do
"
,,
5,16,"to raise the school's test average.
"
,,
5,16,"Then do it.
"
,,
5,16,"All right, we'll drop
"
,,
5,16,"the dumbest student we have:
"
,,
5,16,"Chris Griffin is hereby expelled.
"
,,
5,16,"But if I leave now,
"
,,
5,16,"I won't hear who's the dumbest kid in the school.
"
,,
5,16,"Cool, I don't have to go to school.
"
,,
5,16,"I can just pee in my bed all day.
"
,,
5,16,"Chris, being expelled is a serious thing.
"
,,
5,16,"Peter, we've got to find
"
,,
5,16,"another school for him.
"
,,
5,16,"I say, I could home-school him.
"
,,
5,16,"After all, I taught Cleveland how to make Jiffy Pop.
"
,,
5,16,"So do you think your school
"
,,
5,16,"would be right for Chris?
"
,,
5,16,"Oh, absolutely.
"
,,
5,16,"Quahog School
"
,,
5,16,"for the Deaf has great programs,
"
,,
5,16,"both academic and athletic.
"
,,
5,16,"In fact, you're just in time
"
,,
5,16,"for our homecoming pep rally.
"
,,
5,16,"What are we gonna do to Lincoln?!
"
,,
5,16,"I can't hear you!
"
,,
5,16,"I can't hear you!
"
,,
5,16,"I can't hear you!
"
,,
5,16,"I can't hear you!
"
,,
5,16,"Let's just go.
"
,,
5,16,"Welcome to the Quahog
"
,,
5,16,"Maritime School, Chris.
"
,,
5,16,"Our curriculum consists of being on boats
"
,,
5,16,"for long periods of time with men,
"
,,
5,16,"just men for many days at a time.
"
,,
5,16,"Up on the deck with lots of men
"
,,
5,16,"or down in the galley with lots of men.
"
,,
5,16,"Is this some kind of pirate school?
"
,,
5,16,"Well, a certain kind of pirate.
"
,,
5,16,"Yes, we've been called that.
"
,,
5,16,"I don't know.
"
,,
5,16,"Is there some kind of preschool program?
"
,,
5,16,"You know, I have to admit I've always
"
,,
5,16,"been a little worried about Chris, but
"
,,
5,16,"I guess I just convinced myself
"
,,
5,16,"things would work out for him,
"
,,
5,16,"but with no education, what kind
"
,,
5,16,"of future can he possibly have?
"
,,
5,16,"What are we supposed to do, Lois?
"
,,
5,16,"I mean, it's not like the high school
"
,,
5,16,"will take him back.
"
,,
5,16,"And every other school
"
,,
5,16,"we've tried just doesn't...
"
,,
5,16,"Oh, crap!
"
,,
5,16,"My son got into DeVry.
"
,,
5,16,"Ah, good.
"
,,
5,16,"What'd he have to do,open the door?
"
,,
5,16,"Can't you let me have anything?
"
,,
5,16,"Wait, wait, wait, wait.
"
,,
5,16,"Hang on. Hang on.
"
,,
5,16,"What are we fighting about?
"
,,
5,16,"You know, I have completely forgotten.
"
,,
5,16," Me, too.
"
,,
5,16," Something about a coupon. It's all...
"
,,
5,16," I cannot for the life of me remember.
"
,,
5,16," Oh, my God, that's ridiculous.
"
,,
5,16,"You know what?
"
,,
5,16,"I-I just... I hope I didn't hurt you.
"
,,
5,16,"No, no, no.
"
,,
5,16,"I... I'm all right. I'm all right..
"
,,
5,16,"But listen, you know what?
"
,,
5,16,"Let me make it up to you.
"
,,
5,16,"Why don't you let my wife and
"
,,
5,16,"I take you out to dinner?
"
,,
5,16,"Well, that sounds lovely.
"
,,
5,16,"Uh, that was delicious.
"
,,
5,16,"You know, I drive
"
,,
5,16,"by this place all the time
"
,,
5,16,"and I've never been inside;
"
,,
5,16,"isn't that funny?
"
,,
5,16,"Y-Yeah, you know, Nicole and I
"
,,
5,16,"came here by accident.
"
,,
5,16,"W-We had reservations at another place
"
,,
5,16,"and they... right, right, honey?
"
,,
5,16,"Yeah, they couldn't seat us for like
"
,,
5,16,"an hour, so we ended up coming here
"
,,
5,16," and we just loved it.
"
,,
5,16," Loved it.
"
,,
5,16,"I can see why. I mean,
"
,,
5,16,"th-that halibut was...
"
,,
5,16,"that, may have been the best
"
,,
5,16,"halibut I've ever had.
"
,,
5,16,"Well, glad we talked you out
"
,,
5,16,"of the pork chops, huh?
"
,,
5,16,"Yes! Thank you!
"
,,
5,16,"Oh, oh, oh, lemme, lemme,let me...
"
,,
5,16,"I-I'll get that.
"
,,
5,16,"Oh, no, no, no,no, no, I got it.
"
,,
5,16,"No, no, no, no, no.
"
,,
5,16,"I'm taking care of this.
"
,,
5,16,"No, no, no, your money's
"
,,
5,16,"no good here.
"
,,
5,16,"My food was more expensive.
"
,,
5,16,"I feel bad. If I...
"
,,
5,16,"We invited you. I've got this.
"
,,
5,16," Look, just let goof the check, huh.
"
,,
5,16," You let go of the check.
"
,,
5,16," I'm not taking my hand off this thing.
"
,,
5,16," Well, neither am I.
"
,,
5,16,"Let go of the check.
"
,,
5,16," Ernie, if he wants to...
"
,,
5,16," Stay out of this!
"
,,
5,16,"Don't you talk to my wife like that!
"
,,
5,16,"Oh, yeah?
"
,,
5,16,"What are you gonna do about it?
"
,,
5,16,"Sorry.
"
,,
5,16,"And every other school we've tried just
"
,,
5,16,"doesn't seem to be a good fit for Chris.
"
,,
5,16,"Well, there is one other option.
"
,,
5,16,"Daddy, there's something
"
,,
5,16,"I need you to do for me.
"
,,
5,16,"Chris got expelled from
"
,,
5,16,"James Woods High, and,
"
,,
5,16,"well, I was wondering if you could get him
"
,,
5,16,"into that fancy boarding school you went to.
"
,,
5,16,"You want me to get Chris
"
,,
5,16,"into Morningwood Academy?
"
,,
5,16,"It would mean so much to our family.
"
,,
5,16,"All right, I'll pull some strings
"
,,
5,16,"on one condition:
"
,,
5,16,"I want Peter to do something
"
,,
5,16,"really humiliating.
"
,,
5,16,"Well, what did you have in mind?
"
,,
5,16,"He has to shoot and starin' a shot-for-shot
"
,,
5,16,"remake of Liar, Liar for my amusement.
"
,,
5,16,"Do you know why I stopped you?
"
,,
5,16,"I didn't fasten my seat belt.
"
,,
5,16,"I didn't look in my rear view mirror.
"
,,
5,16,"I didn't signal when I pulled away
"
,,
5,16,"from the curb. I almost hit a Chevy.
"
,,
5,16,"I changed lanes in the intersection
"
,,
5,16,"without signaling.
"
,,
5,16,"I changed lanes while running
"
,,
5,16,"a red light and speeding!
"
,,
5,16,"Well, Chris, here we are.
"
,,
5,16,"Wow, this school is really nice.
"
,,
5,16,"Boy, a degree from here
"
,,
5,16,"would set you up with any job you wanted.
"
,,
5,16,"Yes, I should attend this institution.
"
,,
5,16,"Perhaps one day I could be more powerful
"
,,
5,16,"than King Friday.
"
,,
5,16,"I am the supreme ruler of the
"
,,
5,16,"Neighborhood of Make Believe.
"
,,
5,16,"All will kneel before my...
"
,,
5,16,"What kind of freakin' king lives
"
,,
5,16,"next to the train tracks?
"
,,
5,16,"What is this, Mexico?
"
,,
5,16,"Hi. Is this room 214?
"
,,
5,16,"Oh, you must be our new dorm mate.
"
,,
5,16,"I'm Rogers Chapstick,
"
,,
5,16,"heir to the Chapstick fortune.
"
,,
5,16,"And this is Virgil MasterCard,
"
,,
5,16,"heir to the MasterCard fortune.
"
,,
5,16,"Oh, yes, yes,how do you do, sirrrr?
"
,,
5,16,"And this is James Bottomtooth, IV.
"
,,
5,16," Uh... I'm Chris.
"
,,
5,16," Let me get those bags for you. Johann?
"
,,
5,16,"Um, oh, dear. Johann tells me your
"
,,
5,16,"luggage is the luggage of the poor.
"
,,
5,16,"Well... I am poor.
"
,,
5,16,"Oh.
"
,,
5,16,"Oh, I see.
"
,,
5,16,"What the...?
"
,,
5,16,"This school is not for your kind!
"
,,
5,16,"Why?!
"
,,
5,16,"I still don't fully understand!
"
,,
5,16,"...and that was the third time
"
,,
5,16,"I slept with Katherine Harris.
"
,,
5,16,"Well, I love her politics,
"
,,
5,16,"but how is she in bed?
"
,,
5,16,"Well, as anyone in Florida will tell you,
"
,,
5,16,"she knows how to rig an erection.
"
,,
5,16,"One time I picked my nose and I swear
"
,,
5,16,"I could feel the bottom of my eye.
"
,,
5,16," Shut up, poor kid.
"
,,
5,16," No, I'm serious. Look!
"
,,
5,16,"So, Chris, how's the new school?
"
,,
5,16,"It's awful. I hate it!
"
,,
5,16,"Everybody's mean to me because I'm not rich.
"
,,
5,16,"Oh, no, Chris, that's horrible.
"
,,
5,16,"All right, look,I'll tell you what.
"
,,
5,16,"I'll call Daddy and I'll see
"
,,
5,16,"if there's anything he can do.
"
,,
5,16,"Well, that's enough fun for one day.
"
,,
5,16,"I'm sweating more than a non-legacy
"
,,
5,16,"applying to Yale.
"
,,
5,16,"Where am I?
"
,,
5,16,"Grandpa?
"
,,
5,16,"What are you doing here?
"
,,
5,16,"Chris, welcome to the
"
,,
5,16,"Skull and Bones Society.
"
,,
5,16,"This is where the most powerful men in
"
,,
5,16,"the world are groomed for their futures.

"
,,
5,16,"The Skull and Bones Society

5,16,"has been a part of my family for decades,

"

5,16," Great. Great. Never better.
"
,,
5,16,"Good. Why don't you try putting
"

5,16,"some weight on it?
"

5,16,"Eh, sure.
"

5,16,"Yes! Yes!
"

5,16,"Oh, that's good.
"

5,16,"That feels good.
"
,,
5,16,"Very strong.
"

5,16,"Sorry, Thunder, I gotta put you down.
"

5,16,"How's your leg, huh?!
"

5,16,"How's your leg?! You ready to race?!

"

5,16,"Morningwood Academy
"
,,
5,16,"is charging us $30,000.
"
,,
5,16,"Well, looks like we're all gonna
"
,,
5,16,"have to take second jobs.
"
,,
5,16,"I guess I'll see if I can get my old gig back
"
,,
5,16,"selling buttscratchers at the ballpark.
"
,,
5,16,"Buttscratcher! Buttscratcher!
"
,,
5,16,"Get your buttscratcher here!
"

5,16," Buttscratcher!
"
,,
5,16," Buttscratcher.
"

5,16," Buttscratcher!
"
,,
5,16," Buttscratcher!
"
,,
5,16,"Buttscratcher!
"
,,
5,16," Buttscratcher!
"
,,
5,16,"Chris, come here. You'll love this.
"
,,
5,16,"The first Thursday of every month
"
,,
5,16,"we go to a local orphanage, pick out
"
,,
5,16,"a kid, fill out all the paperwork
"
,,
5,16,"and then don't take him home.
"
,,
5,16,"It's hilarious.
"
,,
5,16,"That sounds kind of cruel.
"
,,
5,16,"No, no, you'll love it.It's great.
"
,,
5,16,"Come on. Come on in.
"
,,
5,16,"Your family's waiting in here.
"
,,
5,16,"There are toys. And a puppy.
"
,,
5,16,"And food that's not served
"
,,
5,16,"from warming trays.
"
,,
5,16,"Come on.You gotta want it.
"
,,
5,16,"Ah, you gotta do better than that.
"
,,
5,16,"Okay, I guess you don't want a new
"
,,
5,16,"family, toys, and a puppy.
"
,,
5,16,"Hi, everybody, I'm home.
"
,,
5,16," Hi, Chris.
"
,,
5,16," Hello.Hey, how are you?
"
,,
5,16,"Well, tell us everything,sweetie.
"
,,
5,16,"How's school going so far?
"
,,
5,16,"It's great, Mom.
"
,,
5,16,"I got powerful connections now,
"
,,
5,16,"thanks to Grandpa.
"
,,
5,16,"Chris, I'd give you a hug, but I'm exhausted from
"
,,
5,16,"working two jobs to pay your tuition.
"
,,
5,16,"I've been selling buttscratchers.
"
,,
5,16," Buttscratcher!
"
,,
5,16," No, Peter.
"
,,
5,16," Buttscratcher!
"
,,
5,16," Peter, no.
"
,,
5,16," Buttscratcher!
"
,,
5,16," No!
"
,,
5,16,"Buttscratcher...
"
,,
5,16,"Dad, you...
"
,,
5,16,"You got an extra job just
"
,,
5,16,"to put me through school?
"
,,
5,16,"We all did, Chris.
"
,,
5,16,"Meg and I have been working nights.
"
,,
5,16,"I'll take the one on the right.
"
,,
5,16,"Well, once again, Meg, I'll be back in an hour.
"
,,
5,16,"And I got a job following fat people
"
,,
5,16,"around with a tuba.
"
,,
5,16,"Stop it.
"
,,
5,16,"Cut it out
"
,,
5,16,"I have a glandular problem.
"
,,
5,16,"That'll be $60.
"
,,
5,16,"You wanted to see me, Grandpa?
"
,,
5,16,"Yes, Chris.
"
,,
5,16,"Your pledge period is over.
"
,,
5,16,"The Skull and Bones elders
"
,,
5,16,"are now ready to admit you to our ranks.
"
,,
5,16,"As is customary with all our new members,
"
,,
5,16,"you now have to spend seven minutes in
"
,,
5,16,"the closet with our most senior member.
"
,,
5,16,"We don't start the clock until the door closes.
"
,,
5,16,"You know, Grandpa, I don't think
"
,,
5,16,"I want to go through with it.
"
,,
5,16,"We all had to do it, Chris.
"
,,
5,16,"Now get in there.
"
,,
5,16,"No, I mean,
"
,,
5,16,"I think I want to go back to my old school.
"
,,
5,16,"My family's working so hard to pay
"
,,
5,16,"my tuition here, and I feel bad.
"
,,
5,16,"Is there any way you can get me back
"
,,
5,16,"into James Woods High?
"
,,
5,16,"Well, I suppose I could
"
,,
5,16,"pull some strings
"
,,
5,16,"if that's really what you want, Chris.
"
,,
5,16,"It is.
"
,,
5,16,"All right,consider it done.
"
,,
5,16,"Thanks, Grandpa.
"
,,
5,16,"Sorry, Master Herbert.
"
,,
5,16,"Sorry? You better get your
"
,,
5,16,"ass in that closet, Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
5,16,"Yes, sir.
"
,,
5,16,"I am so tired of you.
"
,,
5,16,"Ah, it's good to have you back, buddy.
"
,,
5,16,"Thanks, Dad.
"
,,
5,16,"I didn't really fit in there anyway.
"
,,
5,16,"The rooms were only 15x20.
"
,,
5,16,"If I didn't learn to laugh at myself,
"
,,
5,16,"I'd be dead right now.
"
,,
5,16,"Why don't you take your stuff up
"
,,
5,16,"to your room, Chris?
"
,,
5,16,"Okay, Mom.
"
,,
5,16,"Cut it out.
"
,,
5,16,"I'm just trying to live my life.
"
,,
5,16,"No one taught me about carbs.

"

5,17,"Now remember, kids, when we get to
"

5,17,"Mr. Quagmire's cabin, don't touch anything
"

5,17,"before I have a chance to disinfect it.
"

5,17,"Boy, it was nice of Quagmire
"

5,17,"to let us use his place.
"
,,
5,17,"This'll be much better than that vacation
"

5,17,"we took with the Price Is Right yodeler.
"
,,
5,17,"Okay, you can stop here.
"

5,17,"There's no way that microwave
"

5,17,"cost more than 300 bucks.
"

5,17,"Stop here. Don't listen

5,17,"to that fat tourist.
"
,,
5,17,"She doesn't know how
"
,,
5,17,"much a microwave costs. Stop!
"

5,17,"Ah, we should have gone
"

5,17,"to Plinko like Cleveland.
"
,,
5,17,"Oh... Wow, Quagmire's got
"
,,
5,17,"a nice place.
"
,,
5,17,"Ah... This is gonna be
"
,,
5,17,"a relaxing weekend.
"
,,
5,17,"Hey, did you hear
"
,,
5,17,"something?
"
,,
5,17,"I think it came
"
,,
5,17,"from upstairs.
"
,,
5,17,"Oh...
"
,,
5,17,"Hey.
"
,,
5,17,"Uh...
"
,,
5,17,"This the week
"
,,
5,17,"you guys were coming up?
"
,,
5,17,"Beautiful country,
"
,,
5,17,"isn't it, Chris?
"
,,
5,17,"God, it is peaceful,
"
,,
5,17,"no question, Dad.
"
,,
5,17,"Just be careful 'cause they got a lot
"
,,
5,17,"of big ol' wilderness bugs out here.
"
,,
5,17,"Oh, hey.
"
,,
5,17,"Y'all best be careful or I'm gonna
"
,,
5,17,"sting you with my stinger.
"
,,
5,17,"Oh, no!
"
,,
5,17,"But then I's gonna die
"
,,
5,17,"if I sting you.
"
,,
5,17,"You know what?
"
,,
5,17,"I'm not gonna sting y'all after all.
"
,,
5,17,"And that's my choice.
"
,,
5,17,"Y'all ain't worth it.
"
,,
5,17,"I'm just gonna head on over
"
,,
5,17,"to that flower
"
,,
5,17,"and suck on that stamen
"
,,
5,17,"like there's no tomorrow.
"
,,
5,17,"Brian, how many years have I been saying
"
,,
5,17,"you and I should go berry-picking?
"
,,
5,17,"A lot of years, Stewie.
"
,,
5,17,"Wait a minute.
"
,,
5,17,"Do you know where we are, Brian?
"
,,
5,17,"This is a very special place.
"

5,17,"They say once every
"

5,17,"hundred years in this spot,
"

5,17,"Donny Most rises from the mist.
"

"

5,17,"Look!
"
,,
5,17,"Actually,it's Don Most now.
"
,,
5,17,"Happy...</i>
"
,,
5,17,"All right,here's a little
"
,,
5,17,"tune inspired by
"
,,
5,17,"one of the great legends
"
,,
5,17,"of the Old West.
"
,,
5,17,"Well, there once were two cowboys
"
,,
5,17,"all alone out on the trail.
"
,,
5,17,"And they discovered they could
"
,,
5,17,"sleep with another male.
"
,,
5,17,"Now they're having gay sex.
"
,,
5,17,"Cowboy gay sex.
"
,,
5,17,"Sodomy-ee...
"
,,
5,17,"Come on, everybody.
"
,,
5,17,"Sodomy-ee...
"
,,
5,17,"Sodomy-ee.
"
,,
5,17,"Sodomy.
"
,,
5,17,"And when he woke up in the morning,
"
,,
5,17,"she was still in his bed!
"
,,
5,17," That's it?
"
,,
5,17," Yeah.
"
,,
5,17,"And then she wanted to make him eggs.
"
,,
5,17,"And he said, ""Oh,I don't have time.""
"
,,
5,17,"I've got a meeting at 12:30.""
"
,,
5,17,"And she said, ""I'll drive you there.""
"
,,
5,17,"And he said, ""No, no,it's at my office.
"
,,
5,17,"It's, like,a half-hour commute.""
"
,,
5,17,"And she said,
"
,,
5,17,"""I don't mind.
"
,,
5,17,"It's on the way to my kid's preschool.""
"
,,
5,17,"Hey, hey, Lois,look at me.
"
,,
5,17,"I got post partum depression.
"
,,
5,17,"Wah! I'm sad about stuff! Wah!
"
,,
5,17,"You son of a bitch,
"
,,
5,17,"don't even joke about that!
"
,,
5,17,"This water feels kind of funny.
"
,,
5,17,"Yeah, and it smells bad.
"
,,
5,17,"Dad, look!
"
,,
5,17,"Holy crap!
"
,,
5,17,"Oh, my God, what the hell is
"
,,
5,17,"wrong with this lake?!
"
,,
5,17,"I think it's a safe bet
"
,,
5,17,"that that's responsible.
"
,,
5,17,"So they can just dump
"
,,
5,17,"their waste into the lake?
"
,,
5,17,"This can't be legal.
"
,,
5,17,"What kind of world is this where you can't
"
,,
5,17,"even trust the oil companies anymore.
"
,,
5,17," Hey, you've got a tattoo.
"
,,
5,17," No, I don't.
"
,,
5,17," Is that Ziggy?
"
,,
5,17," No.
"
,,
5,17," You have a Ziggy tattoo?
"
,,
5,17," Aw, geez.
"
,,
5,17," Why do you have a Ziggy tattoo?
"
,,
5,17," I just used to think...
"
,,
5,17,"he was kind of funny. We should,
"
,,
5,17,"uh, we should get to the hospital.
"
,,
5,17,"Mom, how long do we have
"
,,
5,17,"to wear these wigs?
"
,,
5,17,"Until our hair grows back, Chris.
"
,,
5,17,"Dad, you couldn't have gotten us
"
,,
5,17,"anything more stylish?
"
,,
5,17,"Oh, I don't think it's so bad.
"
,,
5,17,"I feel rather like Mozart.
"
,,
5,17,"Hey, Stewie, play Haydn.
"
,,
5,17,"Now play Handel.
"
,,
5,17,"Play Peter Griffin.
"
,,
5,17,"Ah, now that is a challenge.
"
,,
5,17,"Go ahead, mock me.
"
,,
5,17,"But it wasn't Stewie
"
,,
5,17,"who was laughing at me.
"
,,
5,17,"It was God.
"
,,
5,17,"What can I do for you, Mrs. Griffin?
"
,,
5,17,"Mayor West, I'm here as
"
,,
5,17,"an outraged citizen.
"
,,
5,17,"The Quahog Oil Refinery is emptying
"
,,
5,17,"all their toxic waste into the lake.
"
,,
5,17,"I mean, you couldn't
"
,,
5,17,"possibly have sanctioned
"
,,
5,17,"that kind of blatant industrial
"
,,
5,17,"pollution, could you?
"
,,
5,17,"Yeah, I told 'em it was fine.
"
,,
5,17,"What?
"
,,
5,17,"And in return, I get free oil
"
,,
5,17,"for my hair.
"
,,
5,17,"Hey, baby, want to take a gander
"
,,
5,17,"at some Adam West penis?
"
,,
5,17,"This is unbelievable!
"
,,
5,17,"Well, I am not gonna stand by while you
"
,,
5,17,"let this town be destroyed by corruption.
"
,,
5,17,"Mr. Mayor, I promise you this:
"
,,
5,17,"Next election,I'm gonna run against you
"
,,
5,17,"and I'm gonna win.
"
,,
5,17,"All right ,Mrs. Griffin,
"
,,
5,17,"you want to take me on? Fine.
"
,,
5,17,"But if you plan to beat me,
"
,,
5,17,"you'll have to...
"
,,
5,17,"What is it?
"
,,
5,17,"A bee just flew in through the window.
"
,,
5,17,"Don't move.
"
,,
5,17,"Hmm, now look who's mayor.
"
,,
5,17,"First order of business,
"
,,
5,17,"free honey for everyone.
"
,,
5,17,"Yay, Mayor Bee, Mayor Bee! Mayor Bee! Ow!
"
,,
5,17,"Oh, done stung myself.
"
,,
5,17,"Bye, world.
"
,,
5,17," Good evening, Quahog. I'm Tom Tucker.
"
,,
5,17," And I'm Diane Simmons.
"
,,
5,17,"The Quahog mayoral race is heating up.
"
,,
5,17,"With incumbent Adam West squaring off
"
,,
5,17,"against challenger Lois Griffin.
"
,,
5,17,"Which leads many political analysts
"
,,
5,17,"to ask the question,
"
,,
5,17,"""Can a woman really be mayor,
"
,,
5,17,"or will she just menstruate all over the city?""
"
,,
5,17,"Stay with us.
"
,,
5,17,"Oh, you guys,I can't tell you how much
"
,,
5,17,"I appreciate all your hard work.
"
,,
5,17,"It's really gonna make a difference
"
,,
5,17,"with my campaign.
"
,,
5,17,"Hey, Lois, take a look.
"
,,
5,17,"I just made 500 T-shirts that say...
"
,,
5,17,"Vote for Lois, unless you're queer.
"
,,
5,17,"No, wait,
"
,,
5,17,"even if you're queer.
"
,,
5,17,"No Jews, though.
"
,,
5,17,"Okay, Jews.
"
,,
5,17,"Oh... These are wonderful, sweetie.
"
,,
5,17,"Chris, why don't you put these upstairs
"
,,
5,17,"in your closet so we don't lose them?
"
,,
5,17,"But the evil monkey lives in my closet.
"
,,
5,17,"Of course, he hasn't been as evil
"
,,
5,17,"since he became a Jehovah's Witness.
"
,,
5,17,"Hi, I'm going door-to-door
"
,,
5,17,"to campaign on behalf of Lois Griffin
"
,,
5,17,"who's offering real change
"
,,
5,17,"for the city of Quahog.
"
,,
5,17,"May we count on your vote next Tuesday?
"
,,
5,17,"Chris, this is our house.
"
,,
5,17,"Ah, then what is for dinner?
"
,,
5,17," Pork chops.
"
,,
5,17," Excellent.
"
,,
5,17," Chris, have you been to any other houses?
"
,,
5,17," I have not.
"
,,
5,17," Would you like to come in?
"
,,
5,17," Please.
"
,,
5,17,"This is Tom Tucker with
"
,,
5,17,"some breaking election coverage.
"
,,
5,17,"Mayor Adam West has widened his lead
"
,,
5,17,"over challenger Lois Griffin.
"
,,
5,17,"I'm confident that the people of Quahog
"
,,
5,17,"will make the right choice.
"
,,
5,17,"And here to help me secure
"
,,
5,17,"the Latino vote is actor Jimmy Smits.
"
,,
5,17,"Adam West likes to eat food
"
,,
5,17,"that's grilled in foil.
"
,,
5,17,"That's our guy.
"
,,
5,17,"Boy, this election's
"
,,
5,17,"gonna be a tight one.
"
,,
5,17,"It's probably gonna be decided
"
,,
5,17,"by just a couple of votes.
"
,,
5,17,"And here we are sitting here
"
,,
5,17,"like a bunch of lazy, paraplegic cops.
"
,,
5,17," Huh?
"
,,
5,17," I'm sorry, Joe. It's just an expression.
"
,,
5,17," Ah.
"
,,
5,17," We got to give Lois a last-minute edge.
"
,,
5,17,"Guys, I need you to help out
"
,,
5,17,"on the campaign.
"
,,
5,17,"Oh, man, that's like making all, like,
"
,,
5,17,"signs, and walking around or what?
"
,,
5,17,"You know, you bastards
"
,,
5,17,"got a stake in this, too.
"
,,
5,17,"I mean, Lois is my wife,
"
,,
5,17,"and if she's the mayor
"
,,
5,17,"we can pretty much do
"
,,
5,17,"whatever the hell we want.
"
,,
5,17,"I could do cocaine if I wanted to.
"
,,
5,17," Peter, you want some potatoes?
"
,,
5,17," Yeah, how you doin'?
"
,,
5,17,"I was just asking if you wanted...
"
,,
5,17,"We got enough napkins?
"
,,
5,17,"Yeah, we got enough napkins.
"
,,
5,17,"That's enough.
"
,,
5,17,"That's enough right there.
"
,,
5,17,"What time is it?
"
,,
5,17,"Is this-Is this straight?
"
,,
5,17,"Is this straight right there?
"
,,
5,17,"Look, wait, see... I'll fix it.
"
,,
5,17,"No, no... Is this straight?
"
,,
5,17,"I can't tell...
"
,,
5,17,"Meg, sweep that up.
"
,,
5,17,"Get-Get a broom, sweep that up.
"
,,
5,17,"Sweep that up. Put it in your room,
"
,,
5,17,"but sweep it up first.
"
,,
5,17,"Suspect number two,
"
,,
5,17,"he's the one who raped me.
"
,,
5,17,"All right, all but number two
"
,,
5,17,"are free to leave.
"
,,
5,17,"Ma'am, I know that you're going through
"
,,
5,17,"a difficult time right now,
"
,,
5,17,"but I just have a few more questions.
"
,,
5,17," Are you planning to vote tomorrow?
"
,,
5,17," What?
"
,,
5,17,"Are you aware that
"
,,
5,17,"Lois Griffin has a plan
"
,,
5,17,"to cut property tax in half
"
,,
5,17,"over the next three years?
"
,,
5,17,"What does that have to do
"
,,
5,17,"with what happened to me?
"
,,
5,17,"Well, you say number two did it,
"
,,
5,17,"maybe I say I smell alcohol
"
,,
5,17,"on your breath.
"
,,
5,17,"You can't do that!
"
,,
5,17,"Sounds like Lois Griffin can
"
,,
5,17,"count on your vote.
"
,,
5,17,"Hi. When you go to vote for mayor
"
,,
5,17,"tomorrow, please vote for Lois Griffin.
"
,,
5,17,"That's right. I work at a deli
"
,,
5,17,"and I know baloney.
"
,,
5,17,"And that's exactly what you'll get
"
,,
5,17,"with Mayor Adam West.
"
,,
5,17,"Ooh, sa-nap!
"
,,
5,17,"Boy, you guys,I really appreciate
"
,,
5,17,"all the help you've been giving us.
"
,,
5,17,"Except for you, Quagmire,
"
,,
5,17,"you ain't done nothing.
"
,,
5,17,"What the hell are you talking about?
"
,,
5,17,"Lois is gonna get the entire
"
,,
5,17,"female vote 'cause of me.
"
,,
5,17,"I've been having sex with every woman
"
,,
5,17,"in town nonstop for the past two days.
"
,,
5,17,"You know how many sperm I got left?
"
,,
5,17,"One.
"
,,
5,17,"He's all alone in there and
"
,,
5,17,"he's scared, all right?
"
,,
5,17," He's scared.
"
,,
5,17," Ah.
"
,,
5,17,"Welcome, Quahog, to the town hall
"
,,
5,17,"mayoral debate
"
,,
5,17,"between incumbent Adam West
"
,,
5,17,"and challenger Lois Griffin.
"
,,
5,17,"We will now open up the floor to
"
,,
5,17,"questions from a community at large.
"
,,
5,17,"Yes, Mrs. Griffin, how do you feel
"
,,
5,17,"about those computer websites
"
,,
5,17,"that put a blue square
"
,,
5,17,"on the home of a sex offender?
"
,,
5,17,"Well, the safety of our children is a
"
,,
5,17,"very important part of my plan for Quahog.
"
,,
5,17,"I have a 12-point program
"
,,
5,17,"for the security of...
"
,,
5,17,"I'm sorry, your time is up.
"
,,
5,17,"No, no, no, no,I'm not impressed.
"
,,
5,17,"I'm not impressed, not yet.
"
,,
5,17,"Mayor West, if reelected,
"
,,
5,17,"would you increase the frequency
"
,,
5,17,"of garbage pickup?
"
,,
5,17,"Well, citizen, that's an excellent
"
,,
5,17,"question and I thank you for it.
"
,,
5,17,"I think it's great we live in a town
"
,,
5,17,"where you can ask questions.
"
,,
5,17,"Because without questions,
"
,,
5,17,"we'd just have answers.
"
,,
5,17,"And an answer without
"
,,
5,17,"a question is a statement.
"
,,
5,17,"Oh, I like him.
"
,,
5,17,"He looks me in the eye.
"
,,
5,17,"I'd like to have a beer with him.
"
,,
5,17,"I'm voting for him.
"
,,
5,17,"I don't understand these people.
"
,,
5,17,"He didn't even say anything
"
,,
5,17,"and they're eating it up.
"
,,
5,17,"Lois, undecided voters
"
,,
5,17,"are the biggest idiots on the planet.
"
,,
5,17,"Try giving short, simple answers.
"
,,
5,17,"Sir, your question, please?
"
,,
5,17,"Mrs. Griffin, what do you plan to
"
,,
5,17,"do about crime in our city?
"
,,
5,17," A lot.
"
,,
5,17," She's got my vote.
"
,,
5,17,"Because that's what Jesus wants.
"
,,
5,17,"I agree with that.
"
,,
5,17,"God, I can't believe how easy this is.
"
,,
5,17,"Mrs. Griffin, what are your plans
"
,,
5,17,"for cleaning up our environment?
"
,,
5,17,"Mrs. Griffin, what about
"
,,
5,17,"our traffic problem?
"
,,
5,17,"Nine...
"
,,
5,17,"Eleven.
"
,,
5,17,"Well, the election results are poring in
"
,,
5,17,"and it looks like it's gonna be a tight one.
"
,,
5,17,"Which reminds me, Diane, when's
"
,,
5,17,"the last time you... aw, forget it.
"
,,
5,17,"Oh, my God,I'm an absolute wreck.
"
,,
5,17,"Well, folks, this is it.
"
,,
5,17,"The last of the votes have been tallied
"
,,
5,17,"and we're getting the final results in now.
"
,,
5,17,"Quahog's new mayor is...
"
,,
5,17,"Lois Griffin.
"
,,
5,17,"Oh, God! Oh, God!
"
,,
5,17,"Oh, God! Oh, God!
"
,,
5,17,"Oh. Were we done cheering?
"
,,
5,17,"Well, Mrs. Mayor,
"
,,
5,17,"how do you feel?
"
,,
5,17,"Oh, I'm a little nervous, Brian,
"
,,
5,17,"but mostly I'm excited
"
,,
5,17,"about all the good I'm gonna get to do.
"
,,
5,17,"Wow, look at you.
"
,,
5,17,"All that power and you've
"
,,
5,17,"still got that body.
"
,,
5,17,"And the first thing I'm going to do as
"
,,
5,17,"mayor is clean up Lake Quahog.
"
,,
5,17,"Well, I know the people will support you,
"
,,
5,17,"Lois, because you connect with them.
"
,,
5,17,"Like Disney connects with it's audience.
"
,,
5,17," You da cow!
"
,,
5,17," No, you da cow!
"
,,
5,17,"Wow, Disney gets us.
"
,,
5,17,"And I think we all realize
"
,,
5,17,"the importance of stopping
"
,,
5,17,"the environmental damage
"
,,
5,17,"being done to Lake Quahog,
"
,,
5,17,"which is why I'm proposing a very modest
"
,,
5,17,"tax increase that will help us to...
"
,,
5,17,"No, no, no, that's awful.
"
,,
5,17,"No, no, no, I'm not okay with that.
"
,,
5,17,"No new taxes!
"
,,
5,17,"But what about the terrorists?
"
,,
5,17,"That's right, terrorists.
"
,,
5,17,"We have intelligence
"
,,
5,17,"that suggests that...
"
,,
5,17,"Hitler is plotting with...
"
,,
5,17,"with the Legion of Doom...
"
,,
5,17,"to assassinate Jesus...
"
,,
5,17,"using the lake as a base.
"
,,
5,17,"How did she discover our plan?
"
,,
5,17,"Me, Solomon Grundy, kind of dropped
"
,,
5,17,"the ball on that one.
"
,,
5,17,"And we alsohave evidence that...
"
,,
5,17,"Darth Vader tried to buy
"
,,
5,17,"yellowcake uranium...
"
,,
5,17,"from unwed teenage mothers.
"
,,
5,17,"Those things all sound scary.
"
,,
5,17,"How much money before it can feel safe again?
"
,,
5,17,"Um...
"
,,
5,17,"a hundred thousand?
"
,,
5,17,"I threw a ten.
"
,,
5,17,"See that ten there? I threw that.
"
,,
5,17,"At the top of the news,
"
,,
5,17,"Lake Quahog is once again clean,
"
,,
5,17,"thanks to the efforts of newly
"
,,
5,17,"elected mayor, Lois Griffin.
"
,,
5,17,"We now go to Asian reporter, Tricia
"
,,
5,17,"Takanawa, for her slant on the story.
"
,,
5,17,"Thanks, Tom.
"
,,
5,17,"Once again, happy locals are frolicking
"
,,
5,17,"in the waters of Lake Quahog.
"
,,
5,17,"And we're here with their reactions.
"
,,
5,17,"Sir, how does it feel
"
,,
5,17,"to have the lake back?
"
,,
5,17,"Well, I'll tell you, Tricia, as a local resident,
"
,,
5,17,"I feel like I can once again
"
,,
5,17,"take pride in my community.
"
,,
5,17,"I think this is really gonna
"
,,
5,17,"revitalize tourism.
"
,,
5,17,"And if you look around, I think even
"
,,
5,17,"the wildlife is starting to come back.
"
,,
5,17,"And, you know, that's something
"
,,
5,17,"we haven't seen in a while.
"
,,
5,17,"I think we're going to be seeing
"
,,
5,17,"a lot more of that.
"
,,
5,17,"Hey, you guys.
"
,,
5,17,"Mom, everyone on TV says
"
,,
5,17,"you're running the town great.
"
,,
5,17,"Maybe you can do some damn
"
,,
5,17,"laundry once in a while.
"
,,
5,17," What?
"
,,
5,17," What?
"
,,
5,17,"Wow, Mom, is that a new purse?
"
,,
5,17,"Yeah, that looks pretty expensive.
"
,,
5,17,"Well, don't tell anybody, Brian,
"
,,
5,17,"but I was a little naughty.
"
,,
5,17,"I may have dipped into
"
,,
5,17,"the tax surplus.
"
,,
5,17,"Wait a minute, you used taxpayer money
"
,,
5,17,"to buy yourself a handbag?
"
,,
5,17,"It's no big deal, Brian.
"
,,
5,17,"Besides, there was a lot left over
"
,,
5,17,"after the lake cleanup
"
,,
5,17,"and I figured maybe
"
,,
5,17,"I earned a little treat, huh?
"
,,
5,17,"Lois, spending even one penny of that
"
,,
5,17,"money on yourself is incredibly unethical.
"
,,
5,17,"Oh, come on, it was only $600.
"
,,
5,17,"My God, that's more than I spent
"
,,
5,17,"to go see that prizefight in Vegas.
"
,,
5,17,"I thought you said we was going
"
,,
5,17,"to see Hairspray.
"
,,
5,17,"Bitch, I thought I said just shut up
"
,,
5,17,"and be lookin' fine.
"
,,
5,17,"What the hell's up with
"
,,
5,17,"these rolling blackouts?
"
,,
5,17,"Well, since Lois is the mayor,
"
,,
5,17,"I'm allowed to reroute
"
,,
5,17,"all the town's electricity.
"
,,
5,17,"What'd you do that for?
"
,,
5,17,"So I could reanimate
"
,,
5,17,"the corpse of Jim Varney.
"
,,
5,17,"Howdy, Vern.
"
,,
5,17,"This is some dad-gum nicehouse
"
,,
5,17,"you got here, Vern.
"
,,
5,17,"That's Vern, V-Vern,Vern, Vern.
"
,,
5,17,"Oh, wait, wait, it was John Belushi,
"
,,
5,17,"that's who I wanted.
"
,,
5,17,"Peter, how could you...?
"
,,
5,17,"Way ahead of you, Brian.
"
,,
5,17,"My mistake, I'll take care of this.
"
,,
5,17," Hey, Jim, come out in the yard, will ya?
"
,,
5,17," Sure thing, Vern.
"
,,
5,17,"He got the shotgun, Brian!
"
,,
5,17,"Don't ask me how he did it,
"
,,
5,17,"but Jim Varney got the shotgun!
"
,,
5,17," Run for your life!
"
,,
5,17," What?!
"
,,
5,17,"Excuse me, how much is this coat?
"
,,
5,17,"It's $4,300.
"
,,
5,17,"Oh.
"
,,
5,17,"Do you think you can give me
"
,,
5,17,"a little mayoral discount?
"
,,
5,17,"Well, I think you're doing a great job,
"
,,
5,17,"Mrs. Griffin, but my boss would kill me.
"
,,
5,17," How's everything going out here?
"
,,
5,17," Fine, Mr. Voorhees.
"
,,
5,17,"Good. 'Cause if you screw up,
"
,,
5,17,"I'll kill ya.
"
,,
5,17,"Hi. Bob Grossbeard, Quahog Oil.
"
,,
5,17,"I'd like to buy you that coat.
"
,,
5,17,"Really?
"
,,
5,17,"All I ask in return is that
"
,,
5,17,"you let my company do
"
,,
5,17,"just a little bit of dumping
"
,,
5,17,"in your lake.
"
,,
5,17,"This guy don't sit right with me, Lois.
"
,,
5,17,"He don't sit right with me.
"
,,
5,17,"But I just cleaned up Quahog Lake.
"
,,
5,17,"Do you want the coat or not?
"
,,
5,17," I want the coat.
"
,,
5,17," Excellent.
"
,,
5,17,"Then we have a deal.
"
,,
5,17,"Ugh, Brian's gonna be really
"
,,
5,17,"upset when he finds out.
"
,,
5,17,"Eh, I'll just take him for a ride in the car,
"
,,
5,17,"he'll forget all about it.
"
,,
5,17,"Wait a minute, I know where we are.
"
,,
5,17,"The park is near here.
"
,,
5,17,"We're near the park, Lois.
"
,,
5,17,"Oh, that's the tree. I peed on that.
"
,,
5,17,"Hey. Hey, Lois. Lois.
"
,,
5,17,"There's another dog in that car.
"
,,
5,17,"H-Hey, hey, hey!
"
,,
5,17,"There's another dog in that car. Hey!
"
,,
5,17,"Are you seeing that?! Hey! Hey! Hey!
"
,,
5,17,"Other dog, fuck you!
"
,,
5,17,"Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf
"
,,
5,17,"of the Quahog Oil Refinery,
"
,,
5,17,"we would like to thank Mayor Lois Griffin
"
,,
5,17,"for our newest waste pipe.
"
,,
5,17,"Let the dumping resume.
"
,,
5,17,"Hey, Jake, how long can you hold
"
,,
5,17,"your breath under water?
"
,,
5,17,"Longer than you. Check it out.
"
,,
5,17,"Aah! My face!
"
,,
5,17,"Lois, what the hell are you doing?
"
,,
5,17,"Remembering who I am, you crook.
"
,,
5,17,"Oh, I'm a crook, am I?
"
,,
5,17,"What about all the money
"
,,
5,17,"you embezzled?
"
,,
5,17,"You want people to find out about that?
"
,,
5,17,"You better play ball, or we'll find
"
,,
5,17,"someone else who will.
"
,,
5,17,"I'll play ball.
"
,,
5,17,"You know what, West?
"
,,
5,17,"You can have your job back.
"
,,
5,17,"Politics does terrible things
"
,,
5,17,"to good people.
"
,,
5,17,"Good for you, Lois.
"
,,
5,17,"You wised up before it was too late.
"
,,
5,17,"I was so consumed by power and money,
"
,,
5,17,"I became the very thing
"
,,
5,17,"I set out to destroy.
"
,,
5,17,"Hooray! I'm mayor again!
"
,,
5,17,"Don't we need to have
"
,,
5,17,"a whole new election?
"
,,
5,17,"There. Now no one will have
"
,,
5,17,"heard him say that.
"
,,
5,17,"We all heard him say it.
"
,,
5,17,"Anybody else hear anything?
"
,,
5,17,"My wife did.

"
,,
5,18,"how was your date last night?
"
,,
5,18,"Cleveland, it was amazing.
"
,,
5,18,"You know what I discovered last night?
"
,,
5,18," Women have a fourth hole.
"
,,
5,18," What?
"
,,
5,18,"Yeah.
"
,,
5,18,"I mean, it's only visible
"
,,
5,18,"if you're looking from
"
,,
5,18,"exactly the right angle,
"
,,
5,18,"like the entrance to Hogwarts.
"
,,
5,18,"But you got to believe that it's there.
"
,,
5,18,"Man, I envy you single guys.
"
,,
5,18,"No families, partying whenever you want.
"
,,
5,18,"These are the only people
"
,,
5,18,"I get to party with.
"
,,
5,18,"That's where the fourth hole is,
"
,,
5,18,"right there.
"
,,
5,18,"Right there in the back of the knee.
"
,,
5,18,"I like having a family. I got all the
"
,,
5,18,"crazy out of my system when I was 18.
"
,,
5,18,"Not me. I was dating Lois
"
,,
5,18,"the whole time.
"
,,
5,18,"I never got to be wild.
"
,,
5,18,"Except for that time I rode
"
,,
5,18,"the mechanical bull at that bar.
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, my God, how embarrassing!
"
,,
5,18,"Look how much fun I am!
"
,,
5,18,"It's like I missed out on half my life.
"
,,
5,18,"What I wouldn't give to be 18 again,
"
,,
5,18,"like those kids on spring break.
"
,,
5,18,"Grim news from Daytona, Florida,
"
,,
5,18,"where the remains of
"
,,
5,18,"three female college students
"
,,
5,18,"were found near a local nightclub.
"
,,
5,18,"Reports suggest that
"
,,
5,18,"all three were violated sexually
"
,,
5,18,"before being brutally murdered.
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, man, see that?
"
,,
5,18,"Everybody's getting laid but me.
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, come on!
"
,,
5,18,"Hang on, I'll fix it.
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, my God, is he dead?
"
,,
5,18,"I think he might be dead!
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, did you hear that?
"
,,
5,18,"Noah Wylie here thinks
"
,,
5,18,"he might be dead.
"
,,
5,18,"Step aside, Junior.
"
,,
5,18,"Nope, he's just knocked out.
"
,,
5,18,"Damn, I drove all the way out here.
"
,,
5,18,"I had to cancel another appointment.
"
,,
5,18,"I never like to be too far away
"
,,
5,18,"from Mike Wallace.
"
,,
5,18,"Hey, Death,
"
,,
5,18,"I-I got a favor to ask you.
"
,,
5,18,"Could you let me go back in time
"
,,
5,18,"and be 18 again?
"
,,
5,18,"What, are you high? No.
"
,,
5,18," All right, you win.
"
,,
5,18,"Let's go.
"
,,
5,18,"But just for one night.
"
,,
5,18,"What the hell? Where are we?
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, my God, this is...
"
,,
5,18,"this is Newport Country Club!
"
,,
5,18,"I used to be a towel boy here!
"
,,
5,18,"That's right, Peter.
"
,,
5,18,"You're 18 years old again.
"
,,
5,18,"At least that's how everyone'll see you.
"
,,
5,18,"Hey, Peter, slap me five.
"
,,
5,18,"Slap me ten.
"
,,
5,18,"Around the side.
"
,,
5,18,"And back again.
"
,,
5,18,"Up high.
"
,,
5,18,"Down low.
"
,,
5,18,"Now over by the diving board.
"
,,
5,18,"Now on the other side of the pool.
"
,,
5,18,"All right, now I want you
"
,,
5,18,"to meet me at this address
"
,,
5,18,"in an hour, and we'll slap five there.
"
,,
5,18,"Then afterwards, we'll hit the bars.
"
,,
5,18,"That sounds good to me.
"
,,
5,18,"I'm 18, and I'm ready to do some living.
"
,,
5,18,"We are gonna raise more hell
"
,,
5,18,"than Hellraiser.
"
,,
5,18,"Hey, honey,
"
,,
5,18," you want some salt for your steak?
"
,,
5,18," Yeah, sure.
"
,,
5,18,"Aha, gotcha!
"
,,
5,18,"That's more salt than you wanted.
"
,,
5,18,"Hello, boys.
"
,,
5,18,"Wow.
"
,,
5,18,"Son of a bitch.
"
,,
5,18,"in sweet Rosita's eyes</i>
"
,,
5,18,"Hi, Peter.
"
,,
5,18,"I'm really looking forward
"
,,
5,18,"to the movie tonight.
"
,,
5,18,"Peter and I are going to see Zapped.
"
,,
5,18,"I figured Scott Baio
"
,,
5,18,"was androgynous enough
"
,,
5,18,"that we could both fantasize about him,
"
,,
5,18,"and no one would be gay.
"
,,
5,18,"Lois, we got the rest of our lives
"
,,
5,18,"for me to not hear a word you just said,
"
,,
5,18,"but tonight, I got plans with Cleveland.
"
,,
5,18,"But we had a date.
"
,,
5,18,"Could I Wham my Oingo Boingo
"
,,
5,18,"into your Velvet Underground?
"
,,
5,18,"Reagan's weekly radio address.</i>
"
,,
5,18,"Ronald Reagan?!
"
,,
5,18,"The actor?!
"
,,
5,18,"He's president?!
"
,,
5,18,"Peter, you're the one from the future.
"
,,
5,18,"You should know... Ah, forget it.
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, you've got to hear this new
"
,,
5,18,"Eddie Murphy cassette I bought.
"
,,
5,18,"I have!
"
,,
5,18,"Wow. You're really good at this game.
"
,,
5,18,"Yeah, I've logged a lot of game hours
"
,,
5,18,"on Menstrual Ms. Pacman.
"
,,
5,18,"What?! What?!
"
,,
5,18," Geez.
"
,,
5,18," Nothing.
"
,,
5,18," Bitch.
"
,,
5,18,"So, uh,
"
,,
5,18," have you seen Ghostbusters?
"
,,
5,18," Save your breath, geekwad.
"
,,
5,18,"I'm here with my boyfriend.
"
,,
5,18,"You mean that quintessentially '80s guy
"
,,
5,18,"with his collar turned up all the way?
"
,,
5,18,"Are you hitting on my girlfriend?
"
,,
5,18," That was nice.
"
,,
5,18," I'll say.
"
,,
5,18,"Peter, is that...?
"
,,
5,18,"Are you...
"
,,
5,18," Molly Ringwald?
"
,,
5,18," Yeah. How's it going?
"
,,
5,18,"Wow, you're the biggest star
"
,,
5,18,"in the world right now.
"
,,
5,18,"What are you doing here?
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, I like to hook up
"
,,
5,18,"with random bar guys.
"
,,
5,18,"Lucky for me, huh?
"
,,
5,18,"No, a hobby's good.
"
,,
5,18,"All right, Peter, your time's up.
"
,,
5,18," Aw, man, already?
"
,,
5,18," Yup, come on.
"
,,
5,18,"Good to meet you, Molly.
"
,,
5,18,"I'll be back later for your career.
"
,,
5,18,"Well, I hope you got your fill, Peter.
"
,,
5,18,"Death, that was totally worth it.
"
,,
5,18,"It was even better
"
,,
5,18,"than the time I stumbled into
"
,,
5,18,"that fat, lonely women's club.
"
,,
5,18,"Uh, excuse me, could I get directions
"
,,
5,18,"to the Providence Civic Center?
"
,,
5,18," Do you like cake?
"
,,
5,18," Yes.
"
,,
5,18," Do you like my ass?
"
,,
5,18," Yes.
"
,,
5,18,"Do you want to eat cake off my ass?
"
,,
5,18,"What kind of cake?
"
,,
5,18,"Angel food cake.
"
,,
5,18,"Well, Rusty,
"
,,
5,18,"looks like we're gonna eat
"
,,
5,18,"our way out of another jam.
"
,,
5,18,"Honey, you awake?
"
,,
5,18,"Morning, sweetie.
"
,,
5,18,"Who the hell are you?!
"
,,
5,18,"What are you doing in my bed?!
"
,,
5,18,"Peter, it's me. Molly? Your wife?
"
,,
5,18,"Molly Ringwald?
"
,,
5,18,"You're my wife?!
"
,,
5,18,"We've been married for 20 years.
"
,,
5,18,"What's wrong with you?
"
,,
5,18,"Hi. I'm Judd Nelson.
"
,,
5,18,"I crash here once or twice a week.
"
,,
5,18,"Brian, Molly Ringwald is in my bed,
"
,,
5,18,"and she says she's my wife!
"
,,
5,18,"That's not all.
"
,,
5,18,"Look at this place.
"
,,
5,18,"Everything's different.
"
,,
5,18,"This is crazy.
"
,,
5,18,"Brian, did you ever see
"
,,
5,18,"that Twilight Zone episode?
"
,,
5,18,"You know, where the woman
"
,,
5,18,"wakes up in the hospital,
"
,,
5,18,"and all the doctors are pigs?
"
,,
5,18,"Yeah.
"
,,
5,18,"I like that one.
"
,,
5,18,"But what the hell is going on here?
"
,,
5,18,"You know, I think I have a theory.
"
,,
5,18,"It's possible that when
"
,,
5,18,"we went back in time,
"
,,
5,18,"we somehow altered the past.
"
,,
5,18,"Geez, Brian, that's more ridiculous
"
,,
5,18,"than the theory of why Tom Cruise
"
,,
5,18,"runs in all his movies.
"
,,
5,18,"Wow, that cameraman
"
,,
5,18,"has nice strong arms.
"
,,
5,18,"You can't catch me, gay thoughts.
"
,,
5,18," Hey, where the hell is Lois?
"
,,
5,18," That's weird.
"
,,
5,18,"Looks like she's coming out
"
,,
5,18,"of Quagmire's house.
"
,,
5,18,"Lois, what the hell?
"
,,
5,18,"I'm gone for one night,
"
,,
5,18,"and you sleep with Quagmire?!
"
,,
5,18,"Mr. Griffin, what I do with my husband
"
,,
5,18,"is none of your business.
"
,,
5,18," Husband?
"
,,
5,18," Morning, Pete.
"
,,
5,18,"Hope you and Molly can still join us
"
,,
5,18,"for dinner tonight.
"
,,
5,18,"Come here, baby.
"
,,
5,18,"Let's go play Schoolgirl
"
,,
5,18,"And Guy Who Has Sex With Schoolgirl.
"
,,
5,18,"Brian, what the hell is going on?!
"
,,
5,18,"We were only in 1984 one night,
"
,,
5,18,"and now everything's all messed up.
"
,,
5,18,"I think I can explain it to you, Peter.
"
,,
5,18,"This line represents
"
,,
5,18,"the normal flow of events.
"
,,
5,18,"Here's where you met Lois,
"
,,
5,18,"here's where you got married,
"
,,
5,18,"and here's the present.
"
,,
5,18,"And here's the night at the bar.
"
,,
5,18,"Now, at some point during that evening,
"
,,
5,18,"you did something that changed
"
,,
5,18,"the course of your history,
"
,,
5,18,"causing the time line to skew off
"
,,
5,18,"into an alternate tangent,
"
,,
5,18,"where you're married to Molly Ringwald,
"
,,
5,18,"Quagmire's married to Lois,
"
,,
5,18,"and for some reason, we have
"
,,
5,18,"a chalk boarding the living room.
"
,,
5,18,"Well, what are we gonna do?
"
,,
5,18,"We got to figure out
"
,,
5,18,"what happened at this point in time.
"
,,
5,18,"And I'll tell you another thing
"
,,
5,18,"that worries me.
"
,,
5,18,"You ever hear the theory that
"
,,
5,18,"if you kill a butterfly in the past,
"
,,
5,18,"it can drastically alter the present?
"
,,
5,18,"Well, who knows what else we changed.
"
,,
5,18,"movie star George Clooney.</i>
"
,,
5,18," Oh, he's good.
"
,,
5,18,"He's funny. Like him.
"
,,
5,18,"Wow. What a show.
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, God, Brian, we messed up bad.
"
,,
5,18,"We messed up real bad.
"
,,
5,18,"Howdy, neighbors! Come on in.
"
,,
5,18,"Hey, Lois, Peter and Molly are here!
"
,,
5,18,"Chris, say hi to Mr. and Mrs. Griffin.
"
,,
5,18," Hi, Mr. Griffin.
"
,,
5,18," How's it goin', man?
"
,,
5,18,"Chris, Stewie!
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
5,18,"All right, don't freak out, Peter.
"
,,
5,18,"Don't freak out like you did
"
,,
5,18,"when your goldfish died.
"
,,
5,18,"Here you go, Lieutenant Shiny-Sides.
"
,,
5,18,"It's okay. You don't have to eat it now.
"
,,
5,18,"You're just sleeping.
"
,,
5,18,"You'll eat it later.
"
,,
5,18,"You'll eat it later,
"
,,
5,18,"Lieutenant Shiny-Sides!
"
,,
5,18,"Meg, stop staring at Mr. Griffin.
"
,,
5,18,"I'm sorry, Peter.
"
,,
5,18,"I'm afraid she's got
"
,,
5,18,"her father's libido.
"
,,
5,18,"What can I say? I'm a Vagitarius. Oh!
"
,,
5,18,"Hey, did you guys hear
"
,,
5,18,"on the news about President Gore
"
,,
5,18,"hunting down and killing
"
,,
5,18,"Osama Bin Laden with his bare hands?
"
,,
5,18,"I know.
"
,,
5,18,"Who would've thought Bin Laden
"
,,
5,18,"was hiding out in the cast of Mad TV.
"
,,
5,18,"Man, the perfect hiding spot.
"
,,
5,18,"The one place no one would look.
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, there's the pie.
"
,,
5,18,"Lois, this is a huge mistake.
"
,,
5,18,"What are you talking about, Peter?
"
,,
5,18,"You're supposed to be married to me.
"
,,
5,18,"We're the ones who were meant
"
,,
5,18,"to be together. Not you and Quagmire.
"
,,
5,18,"It's a little late for that,
"
,,
5,18,"don't you think, Peter?
"
,,
5,18,"I mean, there was a time back when we dated
"
,,
5,18,"that I thought you might be the one,
"
,,
5,18,"but as I recall,
"
,,
5,18,"you were more interested
"
,,
5,18,"in partying with your friends.
"
,,
5,18,"Then Glenn came along,
"
,,
5,18,"and stole my heart.
"
,,
5,18,"When he kissed me that night
"
,,
5,18,"at the Country Club Dance,
"
,,
5,18,"I knew we'd be together forever.
"
,,
5,18,"Hey Lois, I'm ready for your pie.
"
,,
5,18,"And you made dessert, too! Oh!
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, Glenn,
"
,,
5,18,"I love all your sex jokes
"
,,
5,18,"and your dirty puns.
"
,,
5,18,"That's why I married you.
"
,,
5,18," Let's go upstairs and do it.
"
,,
5,18," Okay!
"
,,
5,18,"Brian, going back in time
"
,,
5,18,"ruined my life.
"
,,
5,18,"We've got to get Death
"
,,
5,18,"to send us back to 1984 again
"
,,
5,18,"so I can undo what I did.
"
,,
5,18,"Or we could just make the best of this.
"
,,
5,18,"Al Gore is President.
"
,,
5,18,"We could kind of just take
"
,,
5,18,"that one and call it a win.
"
,,
5,18,"I mean, with Bush, we didn't have
"
,,
5,18,"flying cars that run on vegetable oil.
"
,,
5,18,"No, no, no! No! No!
"
,,
5,18,"I took this one out for you.
"
,,
5,18,"You take this one, I keep this!
"
,,
5,18,"You are not taking my whole wallet
"
,,
5,18,"so you can go shopping.
"
,,
5,18,"I was just going to buy some groceries.
"
,,
5,18,"Bull crap.
"
,,
5,18,"I don't care what it takes, Brian,
"
,,
5,18,"I've got to get Lois back somehow.
"
,,
5,18,"Well, the only one
"
,,
5,18,"who can help us is Death,
"
,,
5,18,"and he only shows up
"
,,
5,18,"when somebody dies.
"
,,
5,18,"That's gonna be tough.
"
,,
5,18,"With President Gore's
"
,,
5,18,"universal health care,
"
,,
5,18,"people are living
"
,,
5,18,"much longer these days.
"
,,
5,18,"And with zero tolerance gun control
"
,,
5,18,"and a strong,
"
,,
5,18,"well-funded educational system,
"
,,
5,18,"there's no street crime.
"
,,
5,18,"Face it, Peter, you not marrying Lois
"
,,
5,18,"was the best thing
"
,,
5,18,"that ever happened to the world.
"
,,
5,18,"I don't care! We've got to find a way
"
,,
5,18,"to summon Death and quick.
"
,,
5,18,"Well, that might do it.
"
,,
5,18,"Death, oh, thank God you're here!
"
,,
5,18,"Listen, you've got to
"
,,
5,18,"send me back in time again
"
,,
5,18,"so I can marry Lois.
"
,,
5,18,"Man, it's been a busy day.
"
,,
5,18,"Dick Cheney,
"
,,
5,18,"the chairman of Halliburton,
"
,,
5,18,"shot Supreme Court Justice Scalia
"
,,
5,18,"in a hunting accident,
"
,,
5,18,"and the bullet went right through him
"
,,
5,18,"and killed Karl Rove and Tucker Carlson.
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, my God, Peter, you can't marry Lois.
"
,,
5,18,"I don't know who any
"
,,
5,18,"of those people are.
"
,,
5,18,"All right, hang on. Here we go.
"
,,
5,18,"This is the exact moment in 1984
"
,,
5,18,"that I sent you to the first time.
"
,,
5,18,"You've just got to manage
"
,,
5,18,"not to screw it up again.
"
,,
5,18,"Lois! Oh, my God,
"
,,
5,18,"it's so good to see you!
"
,,
5,18,"Hey, Peter, you all set
"
,,
5,18,"to go see Zapped! tonight?
"
,,
5,18,"I figure Scott Baio
"
,,
5,18,"was androgynous enough that we...
"
,,
5,18,"That we could both fantasize about him
"
,,
5,18,"and no one would be gay,
"
,,
5,18,"yeah, I know the joke.
"
,,
5,18,"Hey, you know what,
"
,,
5,18,"listen, Zapped! sucks.
"
,,
5,18,"Why don't we go see Krull?
"
,,
5,18,"Peter, you know
"
,,
5,18,"I'm dying to see Zapped!.
"
,,
5,18,"I would much prefer Krull.
"
,,
5,18,"Well, maybe you should
"
,,
5,18,"just go by yourself.
"
,,
5,18," Well, maybe I will.
"
,,
5,18," Fine.
"
,,
5,18,"Crap. Death!
"
,,
5,18," What?
"
,,
5,18," One more time.
"
,,
5,18,"Hey, Peter,
"
,,
5,18,"you all set to go see Zapped! tonight?
"
,,
5,18,"I figured Scott Baio
"
,,
5,18,"was androgynous enough that we...
"
,,
5,18,"That's hilarious!
"
,,
5,18,"You are a delight.
"
,,
5,18,"And Zapped!
"
,,
5,18,"is one of my favorite movies.
"
,,
5,18,"I look forward to watching it
"
,,
5,18,"with you, sweetheart.
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, wonderful.
"
,,
5,18,"Death!
"
,,
5,18,"Hey, Peter,
"
,,
5,18,"you all set to see Zapped! tonight?
"
,,
5,18," I figured Scott Baio...
"
,,
5,18," Yes.
"
,,
5,18,"Scott Baio, gay, blah, blah, blah, blah.
"
,,
5,18,"Ha, ha, ha...
"
,,
5,18,"I can't wait to see the movie.
"
,,
5,18,"Well, terrific. I'll see you tonight.
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, hey, Peter.
"
,,
5,18,"Say, I was just getting ready
"
,,
5,18,"to hit the town.
"
,,
5,18,"You want to join me?
"
,,
5,18,"I can't, Cleveland,
"
,,
5,18,"I got a date with Lois.
"
,,
5,18,"It's gonna to be fun.
"
,,
5,18,"It is?
"
,,
5,18,"Peter, what the hell are you doing?
"
,,
5,18,"You're supposed to be with Lois.
"
,,
5,18,"Aw, crap! Death!
"
,,
5,18,"No. You know what?
"
,,
5,18,"I'm not doing it again.
"
,,
5,18,"Screw this. No more mulligans.
"
,,
5,18,"You're on your own.
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, damn it, Brian,
"
,,
5,18,"what the hell am I gonna do now?
"
,,
5,18,"I haven't screw up this bad since
"
,,
5,18,"I bought Joe Piscopo that barbell set.
"
,,
5,18,"All right Joe, now
"
,,
5,18,"don't get carried away with this.
"
,,
5,18,"Don't worry, Peter.
"
,,
5,18,"I'll only work out during my downtime.
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, look who it is. Only 14 hours late.
"
,,
5,18,"If you don't want to spend time
"
,,
5,18,"with me, Peter, that's fine.
"
,,
5,18,"But at least don't make me
"
,,
5,18,"wait up all night for you.
"
,,
5,18,"Lois I'm so sorry.
"
,,
5,18,"I promise, I'll make it up
"
,,
5,18,"to you tonight.
"
,,
5,18,"We can watch any stupid movie you want.
"
,,
5,18,"Sorry, I've already got plans.
"
,,
5,18,"What do you mean plans?
"
,,
5,18,"I'm going to the Country Club Dance
"
,,
5,18,"with Glenn.
"
,,
5,18,"I wanted to surprise you
"
,,
5,18,"with the invitation last night,
"
,,
5,18,"but you never showed up.
"
,,
5,18,"Now, if you'll excuse me,
"
,,
5,18,"I have to get ready.
"
,,
5,18,"Peter, the Country Club Dance
"
,,
5,18,"is where Lois said
"
,,
5,18,"she fell in love with Quagmire.
"
,,
5,18,"If they kissed at that dance,
"
,,
5,18,"you're finished.
"
,,
5,18,"You're right, Brian.
"
,,
5,18,"We've got to stop them.
"
,,
5,18,"And I think I know how.
"
,,
5,18," Peter!
"
,,
5,18," Oh, God, sorry! Sorry!
"
,,
5,18,"Sorry. You're right,
"
,,
5,18,"let's go to the dance.
"
,,
5,18,"Peter used to be so passionate.
"
,,
5,18,"Suddenly he just doesn't seem
"
,,
5,18,"very interested in me anymore.
"
,,
5,18,"Lois, if I may speak freely,
"
,,
5,18,"as a friend?
"
,,
5,18,"You deserve better than Peter.
"
,,
5,18,"You deserve a gentleman.
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, Glenn, you're so sweet.
"
,,
5,18," Oh! Something popped me.
"
,,
5,18," It's okay, it's ok.
"
,,
5,18,"It's just my wang.
"
,,
5,18,"Now I know what a TV dinner feels like.
"
,,
5,18," What?
"
,,
5,18," It's a line from Die Hard.
"
,,
5,18,"Hasn't been made yet.
"
,,
5,18,"We could ride it, Brian.
"
,,
5,18,"After we're done with this,
"
,,
5,18,"we could ride it.
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, my God! You just crushed Andy!
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, yeah, sorry about that.
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, oh, you're sorry?
"
,,
5,18,"Who's gonna play guitar?
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, I love this song.
"
,,
5,18,"Lois, may I have this dance?
"
,,
5,18,"Peter, what are you doing here?
"
,,
5,18,"I love you, Lois Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
5,18,"And not Quagmire or any man,
"
,,
5,18,"she-male, robot or sentient robot
"
,,
5,18,"curious about its own existence
"
,,
5,18,"is going to keep you from me!
"
,,
5,18,"Peter, I am here with Glenn.
"
,,
5,18,"You had your chance with me
"
,,
5,18,"and you blew it.
"
,,
5,18,"Now leave us alone.
"
,,
5,18,"Is that what you really want, Lois?
"
,,
5,18,"Yes, it is.
"
,,
5,18,"Well, I guess that's it.
"
,,
5,18,"Who the hell am I kidding?
"
,,
5,18,"I don't deserve her.
"
,,
5,18,"Come on, Peter.
"
,,
5,18,"Prove to Lois that you love her.
"
,,
5,18,"It's your last chance.
"
,,
5,18," Hey, Quagmire.
"
,,
5,18," Huh?
"
,,
5,18,"Sorry, Lois, but I have to do this.
"
,,
5,18,"Oh, Peter,
"
,,
5,18,"that was so passionate.
"
,,
5,18,"Why, I didn't know
"
,,
5,18,"I meant that much to you.
"
,,
5,18,"Are you kidding?
"
,,
5,18,"Lois, I couldn't bear
"
,,
5,18,"to live without you.
"
,,
5,18,"I came back thinking
"
,,
5,18,"I was missing something in my life.
"
,,
5,18,"But what I almost missed was the
"
,,
5,18,"best thing that's ever happened to me.
"
,,
5,18,"Lois Pewterschmidt,
"
,,
5,18,"will you be my wife?
"
,,
5,18,"Yes.
"
,,
5,18,"Yes, I will.
"
,,
5,18,"I think they want another one.
"
,,
5,18,"Uh... okay.
"
,,
5,18,"Here's a song by a gay guy.
"
,,
5,18,"Never gonna let you down </i>
"
,,
5,18,"Whoa, whoa, big guy.
"
,,
5,18,"You're probably never even
"
,,
5,18,"gonna see him again.
"
,,
5,18,"Hey, Rick, it's your cousin, Marvin.
"
,,
5,18,"Marvin Astley?!
"
,,
5,18,"You know that mediocre, generic sound
"
,,
5,18,"you've been looking for?
"
,,
5,18,"Well, listen to this!
"
,,
5,18,"Never gonna give</i>
"
,,
5,18,"Never gonna give</i>
"
,,
5,18,"I didn't like any of that.
"
,,
5,18,"Wow, Peter, that's an amazing story.
"
,,
5,18,"And I'm touched that you went through
"
,,
5,18,"so much trouble just to be with me.
"
,,
5,18,"Obviously, I made the right choice
"
,,
5,18,"when I married you.
"
,,
5,18,"Me, too, Lois.
"
,,
5,18,"And, hey, let's just all be grateful
"
,,
5,18,"that things are completely back
"
,,
5,18,"to normal again.

"
,,
6,1," Oh, my God! The power's out!
"
,,
6,1," What are we gonna do now?
"
,,
6,1,"Well, we could light some candles and read.
"
,,
6,1," Yeah, right.
"
,,
6,1," That'd be great.
"
,,
6,1,"Read the inside of my butt!
"
,,
6,1,"We could tell stories.
"
,,
6,1,"Dad, tell the story about when I was born.
"
,,
6,1,"We got halfway home with the afterbirth, then
"
,,
6,1,"had to go back and swap it for Meg. The end.
"
,,
6,1,"I got a better one. This is a story
"
,,
6,1,"of love and loss, fathers and sons,
"
,,
6,1,"and the foresight to retain
"
,,
6,1,"international merchandising rights.
"
,,
6,1,"This is the story of <i>Star Wars.</i>
"
,,
6,1,"Let's begin with part IV.
"
,,
6,1,"we're being boarded from the rear.
"
,,
6,1,"And not the ""Let's experiment""
"
,,
6,1,"kind of boarded from the rear.
"
,,
6,1,"Uh, could you hold onto this bag?
"
,,
6,1,"What if they come in a different door?
"
,,
6,1,"I guess we'd all just get up
"
,,
6,1,"and go to <i>that</i> door.
"
,,
6,1," Is it gonna be like this all day?
"
,,
6,1," I'm just trying to contribute.
"
,,
6,1,"Well, contribute to
"
,,
6,1,"pointing your gun at that door.
"
,,
6,1,"Why are you always way nicer to me
"
,,
6,1,"when the other rebels aren't around?
"
,,
6,1,"Damn! I was two days from retirement.
"
,,
6,1,"R2?
"
,,
6,1,"Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
"
,,
6,1,"You're my only hope.
"
,,
6,1," All right, now, what do I click?
"
,,
6,1," Click ""Preferences"".
"
,,
6,1," OK, I clicked ""Preferences"".
"
,,
6,1," Now go to ""Default media browser"".
"
,,
6,1,"OK. There's a little hourglass
"
,,
6,1,"and it's not letting me do anything.
"
,,
6,1," It says ""buffering"". What is that?
"
,,
6,1," Just give it a minute.
"
,,
6,1," All I'm trying to do it make an MPEG.
"
,,
6,1," All I'm trying to do is tell you to wait.
"
,,
6,1," OK. Relax.
"
,,
6,1," Now click ""lmport video file"".
"
,,
6,1,"All right. It's telling me
"
,,
6,1,"I have to download RealPlayer 7.
"
,,
6,1,"You know what?
"
,,
6,1,"I'll just bring it to him myself.
"
,,
6,1,"There she is.
"
,,
6,1,"You still got that bag I gave you?
"
,,
6,1,"It's gonna be a long ride.
"
,,
6,1,"Hold your fire. There's no life forms aboard.
"
,,
6,1,"""Hold your fire""?!
"
,,
6,1,"Are we paying by the laser now?
"
,,
6,1,"You don't do the budget, Terry. I do!
"
,,
6,1,"I'm gonna do crosswords
"
,,
6,1,"but that doesn't mean I don't wanna talk.
"
,,
6,1,"Oh, yeah, yeah.
"
,,
6,1,"""Darth Vader's gonna be here.
"
,,
6,1,"Shall we clean up?""
"
,,
6,1,"""No, it's OK, he won't mind.""
"
,,
6,1,"Well, well! Princess Leia.
"
,,
6,1,"Prepared to tell me what you've done
"
,,
6,1,"with the stolen Death Star plans?
"
,,
6,1,"All right, Lord Vader, you win.
"
,,
6,1,"I've hidden the plans
"
,,
6,1,"in one of these 26 briefcases.
"
,,
6,1,"Ooh, ooh! OK, OK. I'm feeling number 14.
"
,,
6,1,"Let's go with number 14.
"
,,
6,1,"All right, take her away.
"
,,
6,1,"OK, who would you rather do:
"
,,
6,1,"Jabba the Hutt right after a shower,
"
,,
6,1,"or a service droid?
"
,,
6,1," My father was a service droid!
"
,,
6,1," Hey, where are you going?
"
,,
6,1,"You can kiss the lower part of the back
"
,,
6,1,"of the canister that is my body.
"
,,
6,1,"Oh, man, this looks like
"
,,
6,1,"the wrong neighbourhood.
"
,,
6,1,"Oh, boy. It's OK, R2 - calm down, be cool.
"
,,
6,1,"I ain't done nothing to antagonise nobody.
"
,,
6,1,"What, a droid can't walk
"
,,
6,1,"down the desert no more?
"
,,
6,1,"I got rights, too.
"
,,
6,1,"Who's there?
"
,,
6,1,"Any attack by the rebels against this station
"
,,
6,1,"would be a useless gesture,
"
,,
6,1,"no matter what technical data they obtained.
"
,,
6,1,"This station is now
"
,,
6,1,"the ultimate power in the universe.
"
,,
6,1,"That is fantastic. Terrific work.
"
,,
6,1,"So no weaknesses at all, huh?
"
,,
6,1,"N... No.
"
,,
6,1,"You hesitated there.
"
,,
6,1,"Is there something I should know?
"
,,
6,1,"No. It's virtually indestructible - like, 99.99%.
"
,,
6,1,"Uh, OK. Wouldn't be doing my job
"
,,
6,1,"if I didn't ask: What's the.01?
"
,,
6,1,"Well, I mean, there's this little hole -
"
,,
6,1,"it was kind of an aesthetic choice
"
,,
6,1,"by the architect -
"
,,
6,1,"and if you shoot a laser into this hole,
"
,,
6,1,"the station blows up.
"
,,
6,1,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
"
,,
6,1,"That sounds like a pretty big design flaw.
"
,,
6,1," No, no. The hole's only two metres across.
"
,,
6,1," That's no bigger than a womp rat.
"
,,
6,1,"Exactly. And to get within range of it, you
"
,,
6,1,"have to skim along a trench. It's no big deal.
"
,,
6,1,"Can't we board it up
"
,,
6,1,"or put some plywood over it or something?
"
,,
6,1,"That would look terrible -
"
,,
6,1,"we gotta think about resale.
"
,,
6,1,"What? This property is right above Sunset -
"
,,
6,1,"the value's only gonna go up.
"
,,
6,1,"Lord Vader, your inside references
"
,,
6,1,"to the Los Angeles real estate market
"
,,
6,1,"haven't given you the clairvoyance to
"
,,
6,1,"turn a profit on that condo in Glendale. Nor...
"
,,
6,1," I find your lack of faith disturbing.
"
,,
6,1,"That property is in a prime location -
"
,,
6,1,"There's nothing to do downtown.
"
,,
6,1,"Enough of this!
"
,,
6,1,"Vader, release him.
"
,,
6,1," As you wish.
"
,,
6,1," All right, so we're gonna plug up that hole?
"
,,
6,1," Tomorrow, if price is no object.
"
,,
6,1,"Uh...
"
,,
6,1," We'll get estimates.
"
,,
6,1," Get estimates, yeah. Yeah.
"
,,
6,1,"Someone was in the pod.
"
,,
6,1,"The tracks go off in this direction.
"
,,
6,1," Look, sir, droids.
"
,,
6,1," Look, a penny!
"
,,
6,1,"Hey, thanks for the sex, early '90s printer.
"
,,
6,1,"All right, bring him on out.
"
,,
6,1,"Oh, God, it's 100 degrees out here.
"
,,
6,1,"If I pass out, note I'm wearing a LifeCall
"
,,
6,1,"bracelet with all my insurance information.
"
,,
6,1," Luke?
"
,,
6,1," What?!
"
,,
6,1,"Tell Uncle Owen not to tell you
"
,,
6,1,"that your father is Darth Vader.
"
,,
6,1,"Aunt Beru, when are you guys gonna
"
,,
6,1,"let me join the rebellion like all my friends?
"
,,
6,1,"Oh, stop whining, Luke,
"
,,
6,1,"and come have some blue milk.
"
,,
6,1,"One day, I'm just gonna take off and join
"
,,
6,1,"the rebellion, whether you like it or not.
"
,,
6,1,"Over my burnt carcass!
"
,,
6,1," Hey, shut up-a with the noise-a!
"
,,
6,1," Shut up-a with the ""shut up-a"".
"
,,
6,1," You shut up-a with the ""shut up-a"".
"
,,
6,1," Shut up-a your face.
"
,,
6,1," Why you no shut up-a?
"
,,
6,1," Shut up-a.
"
,,
6,1," Shut up-a.
"
,,
6,1," Hey, I poke out-a my head.
"
,,
6,1,"Some day, I'll get off this rock
"
,,
6,1,"and fight the Empire.
"
,,
6,1,"John Williams and the
"
,,
6,1,"London Symphony Orchestra, everybody!
"
,,
6,1,"Now do the theme to <i>The People's Court.</i>
"
,,
6,1,"Oh, this oil bath is gonna feel so good.
"
,,
6,1,"You guys think that '90s printer
"
,,
6,1,"looked clean, right?
"
,,
6,1,"Hey, there's something stuck in this R2 unit.
"
,,
6,1,"Whoever she is,
"
,,
6,1,"she sounds like she's in trouble.
"
,,
6,1,"Is there any more to this message?
"
,,
6,1,"She said ""Obi-Wan Kenobi"".
"
,,
6,1,"I wonder if she means old <i>Obi- Wan</i> Kenobi?
"
,,
6,1,"Well, I guess I'll go bull's-eye
"
,,
6,1,"some womp rats in my T-16.
"
,,
6,1,"My God, you shoot small animals for fun?
"
,,
6,1,"That's the first indicator of a serial killer.
"
,,
6,1,"There's two suns and no women -
"
,,
6,1,"what the hell am I supposed to do?!
"
,,
6,1,"Master Luke, he's gone! He's gone!
"
,,
6,1," What?
"
,,
6,1," R2. He took off in the middle of the night.
"
,,
6,1,"What the <i>Phantom Menace</i>
"
,,
6,1,"is that guy's problem?
"
,,
6,1,"Mind if I turn on the radio?
"
,,
6,1," R2, what are you doing out here?
"
,,
6,1," Beep, oop, beep.
"
,,
6,1,"He says there are creatures
"
,,
6,1,"approaching from the southeast.
"
,,
6,1,"That's not what I said. I said, ""There ain't
"
,,
6,1,"a pack of menthols on this planet.""
"
,,
6,1,"Well, I see some bantha tracks,
"
,,
6,1,"but I don't see any...
"
,,
6,1,"Wait a minute, they're Sand People, all right.
"
,,
6,1,"I can see one of 'em now.
"
,,
6,1,"Who the hell are you?
"
,,
6,1,"One lucky son of a bitch!
"
,,
6,1,"So, Luke, what brings
"
,,
6,1,"your muscly arms out this way?
"
,,
6,1,"I'll show you, Mr Obi-Wan.
"
,,
6,1,"R2, play him the message.
"
,,
6,1,"This is just, like, logistical stuff.
"
,,
6,1,"I'll check that later.
"
,,
6,1,"Luke, you must learn the ways of the Force
"
,,
6,1,"and come with me to Alderaan.
"
,,
6,1," What's the Force?
"
,,
6,1," It's what gives a Jedi Knight his power.
"
,,
6,1,"It surrounds us. It penetrates us.
"
,,
6,1,"Mmmmmm!
"
,,
6,1,"Here, check this out.
"
,,
6,1,"Wow! This is cool!
"
,,
6,1,"Yeah, everyone in
"
,,
6,1,"the neighbourhood has one.
"
,,
6,1,"Hey, why would you hang that up?
"
,,
6,1,"It looks so tantalising.
"
,,
6,1,"You know, the Empire's gonna
"
,,
6,1,"come looking for these droids.
"
,,
6,1,"But if they find out who the Jawas sold them
"
,,
6,1,"to, that could lead them back... home!
"
,,
6,1,"Luke, wait! It's too dangerous!
"
,,
6,1,"Get your fat space ass back here.
"
,,
6,1,"Uncle Owen?
"
,,
6,1,"Aunt Beru?
"
,,
6,1,"Great. Now we gotta do the rest of this thing
"
,,
6,1,"with Danny Elfman.
"
,,
6,1,"You will never find a more wretched hive
"
,,
6,1,"of scum and villainy.
"
,,
6,1,"My sister, Regina-D2, lives here.
"
,,
6,1," Is she single?
"
,,
6,1," She's a lesbot.
"
,,
6,1,"How are we gonna get in here?
"
,,
6,1,"We don't have any chicks with us.
"
,,
6,1,"It's way easier to get into these clubs if you
"
,,
6,1,"have chicks in your group. Noticed that?
"
,,
6,1,"No, uh... I never have.
"
,,
6,1,"Sorry, private party tonight.
"
,,
6,1," I'm a friend of Dave Navarro's.
"
,,
6,1," You're a friend of Dave Navarro's.
"
,,
6,1,"You saw me here last week.
"
,,
6,1,"I seemed like a cool dude.
"
,,
6,1,"I saw you here last week.
"
,,
6,1,"You seemed like a cool dude.
"
,,
6,1," Move along.
"
,,
6,1," Move along, move along.
"
,,
6,1," He doesn't like you.
"
,,
6,1," Sorry.
"
,,
6,1," I don't like you either.
"
,,
6,1," You don't even know me!
"
,,
6,1,"That's fair.
"
,,
6,1,"I'm Pignose, and this is my brother-in-law,
"
,,
6,1,"Scott. He's visiting from Hoth.
"
,,
6,1,"I don't know why they call it Hoth.
"
,,
6,1,"They should call it Coldth.
"
,,
6,1," OK, settle down.
"
,,
6,1," I'm up after the band.
"
,,
6,1,"Thank you. We're the Cantina Band.
"
,,
6,1,"If you have any requests, shout 'em out.
"
,,
6,1," Same song. Here we go.
"
,,
6,1,"Oh, no, stormtroopers!
"
,,
6,1,"Quick, R2, in here.
"
,,
6,1,"This door is locked. Move on to the next one.
"
,,
6,1," Maybe they're behind this door.
"
,,
6,1," I just said it's locked.
"
,,
6,1,"Can't you knock or something?
"
,,
6,1,"Hello-o?
"
,,
6,1,"Whoever's in there won't be getting this giant
"
,,
6,1,"cheque from Publisher's Clearing House.
"
,,
6,1," Hear something?
"
,,
6,1," I heard voices, but they stopped,
"
,,
6,1,"so I'm gonna assume there's no one in there.
"
,,
6,1,"Hi. My sexy friend and I are looking
"
,,
6,1,"for a ship to take us to Alderaan,
"
,,
6,1,"and I'm willing to pay big money.
"
,,
6,1,"Well, you've come to the right place. I'm
"
,,
6,1,"Han Solo, captain of the <i>Millennium Falcon,</i>
"
,,
6,1,"and the only actor whose career
"
,,
6,1,"isn't destroyed by this movie.
"
,,
6,1," Is it a fast ship?
"
,,
6,1," Are you kidding?
"
,,
6,1,"It's the ship that made the Kessel run
"
,,
6,1,"in less than 12 parsecs.
"
,,
6,1,"Oh... Isn't a parsec
"
,,
6,1,"a unit of distance, not time?
"
,,
6,1,"No, no, no. Chewie, take these guys
"
,,
6,1,"to the ship and get her ready.
"
,,
6,1,"Always gargle before a takeoff. Wacca-wacca.
"
,,
6,1,"All right, let's go.
"
,,
6,1,"Greedo, as a matter of fact,
"
,,
6,1,"I was just going to see Jabba and tell him...
"
,,
6,1," Well, what do you think?
"
,,
6,1," What a piece ofjunk!
"
,,
6,1,"Thank you. This was my brother's.
"
,,
6,1,"He died of leukaemia. How do you feel now?
"
,,
6,1," No, but she'll make.5 past light speed.
"
,,
6,1,"I'll show you around, since no one's
"
,,
6,1,"trying to stop the ship or blast us.
"
,,
6,1,"Stop that ship. Blast 'em.
"
,,
6,1,"Now I can't show you around.
"
,,
6,1,"Quick, get in the ship.
"
,,
6,1,"We got lmperial cruisers on our tail.
"
,,
6,1,"Look at that one on the left.
"
,,
6,1,"Get off your cellphone, you are driving.
"
,,
6,1," They're gaining on us.
"
,,
6,1," We'll be safe once we jump to hyperspace.
"
,,
6,1,"Besides, I know a few manoeuvres.
"
,,
6,1,"We'll lose 'em.
"
,,
6,1,"Uh, that... that was your manoeuvre -
"
,,
6,1,"moving slightly to the left?
"
,,
6,1,"Well, we're not in the same place we were.
"
,,
6,1,"Huh? That ought to confuse 'em.
"
,,
6,1,"Yeah, but you hardly did anything.
"
,,
6,1,"You just started listing lazily to the left.
"
,,
6,1,"I'm sure they can keep up.
"
,,
6,1," Where did they go?
"
,,
6,1," There they are, listing lazily to the left. Left!
"
,,
6,1,"Boy, this guy knows some manoeuvres!
"
,,
6,1,"Strap yourselves in.
"
,,
6,1,"I'm jumping to light speed.
"
,,
6,1,"Did he say ""strap in"" or ""strap-on""?
"
,,
6,1,"Man, hyperspace always look so freaky.
"
,,
6,1,"Governor Tarkin. I recognised your foul
"
,,
6,1,"stench as soon as I was brought on board.
"
,,
6,1,"Um, actually, that's me.
"
,,
6,1,"I made a Darth doodie.
"
,,
6,1,"I Sith-ed my pants.
"
,,
6,1,"My diaper's gone over to the dark side.
"
,,
6,1,"I got pages of these - I could go on.
"
,,
6,1,"Princess Leia, we've chosen to test
"
,,
6,1,"our Death Star, planet-blower-upper gun
"
,,
6,1,"on your home planet of Alderaan.
"
,,
6,1,"No!
"
,,
6,1,"She said no. Should we still do it?
"
,,
6,1,"Yeah.
"
,,
6,1,"So anyway, I says, ""Forget the dental plan,
"
,,
6,1,"forget sick leave, I just want a railing.""
"
,,
6,1," You know? One railing, right here.
"
,,
6,1," I've almost fallen over there so many times.
"
,,
6,1," So what did they say?
"
,,
6,1," They're worried we'd be leaning all day.
"
,,
6,1," They said that?!
"
,,
6,1," Yeah.
"
,,
6,1,"None of this will matter
"
,,
6,1,"when we're famous singers.
"
,,
6,1,"Good evening, Death Star. Tonight, a special
"
,,
6,1,"report on a controversial attack on Alderaan.
"
,,
6,1,"While some view the attack as unwarranted,
"
,,
6,1,"the Empire has obtained proof
"
,,
6,1,"that Alderaan was in possession
"
,,
6,1,"of weapons of mass destruction.
"
,,
6,1,"Now let's go to our forecast.
"
,,
6,1,"What's the weather like, Ali?
"
,,
6,1," Space weather!
"
,,
6,1," Thanks.
"
,,
6,1,"Coming up, the road closures for this week's
"
,,
6,1,"Ewok Pride parade. Stay with us.
"
,,
6,1," How am I doing?
"
,,
6,1," Just keep your knees bent.
"
,,
6,1,"Imagine you're spreading butter
"
,,
6,1,"on a big piece of bread.
"
,,
6,1,"That's it, spread that butter, with the Force.
"
,,
6,1,"Ha! You guys seem like crazy morons to me.
"
,,
6,1,"You don't believe in the Force, do you?
"
,,
6,1,"You mean that thing you just found out about
"
,,
6,1,"and are now judging me for not believing in?
"
,,
6,1," Do you believe in anything?
"
,,
6,1," Yeah. Didn't you see my kabbalah bracelet?
"
,,
6,1," What's kabbalah?
"
,,
6,1," About a buck, 75.
"
,,
6,1,"Honestly, I have no idea.
"
,,
6,1,"I'm just a slave to trends.
"
,,
6,1,"What the hell? Oh, my God! We came
"
,,
6,1,"out of hyperspace into an asteroid field.
"
,,
6,1,"Alderaan's been destroyed by the Empire!
"
,,
6,1,"Maybe we should head for that small moon
"
,,
6,1,"that's clearly a small moon, not anything else.
"
,,
6,1,"That's no moon. It's a space station.
"
,,
6,1,"Oh, crap! They got us in a tractor beam.
"
,,
6,1,"They're not gonna get me without a fight.
"
,,
6,1,"You can't win.
"
,,
6,1,"But there are alternatives to fighting.
"
,,
6,1," Like what?
"
,,
6,1," Like getting the hell outta here!
"
,,
6,1,"No, just kidding.
"
,,
6,1,"Can you imagine if I was like that?
"
,,
6,1,"and act real cool.
"
,,
6,1,"All right, I'm gonna go knock out
"
,,
6,1,"that tractor beam.
"
,,
6,1,"And we'll go rescue the princess.
"
,,
6,1,"You know, Luke, this may be
"
,,
6,1,"the last time we see each other,
"
,,
6,1,"so there's something I want you to know.
"
,,
6,1," Now, I've had the time of my life
"
,,
6,1," And I owe it all to you
"
,,
6,1," I've been waiting for so long
"
,,
6,1," Now I've finally found someone
"
,,
6,1,"to stand by me
"
,,
6,1," So we take each other's hand
"
,,
6,1," Cos we seem to understand
"
,,
6,1," The urgency
"
,,
6,1," Just remember
"
,,
6,1," You're the one thing
"
,,
6,1," I can't get enough of
"
,,
6,1," Shall I tell you something?
"
,,
6,1," This could be love
"
,,
6,1," Because
"
,,
6,1," I've had the time of my life
"
,,
6,1," No, I've never felt this way before
"
,,
6,1," Yes, I swear it's the truth
"
,,
6,1," And I owe it all to you
"
,,
6,1,"Holy shit!
"
,,
6,1," You'll never believe what I just seen.
"
,,
6,1," Tyra Banks?
"
,,
6,1,"Now you've said something better,
"
,,
6,1,"so my thing don't sound cool.
"
,,
6,1," Come on, what'd you see?
"
,,
6,1," I don't remember.
"
,,
6,1," I just was thinking about Tyra Banks.
"
,,
6,1," Ooh! Can you imagine?
"
,,
6,1,"Every night! Don't shake my hand!
"
,,
6,1,"You ain't got no hand. You're a little truck.
"
,,
6,1,"and we just passed that. It's right back there.
"
,,
6,1,"Now, we parked on the Macy's side,
"
,,
6,1,"so now we must be over here by JC Penney.
"
,,
6,1,"and there's a Lady Foot Locker there.
"
,,
6,1,"cos the smell of that Mrs. Fields is killing me.
"
,,
6,1,"And do you, Alan, take Judith
"
,,
6,1,"to be your lawfully wedded wife,
"
,,
6,1,"till death or a giant explosion do you part?
"
,,
6,1,"Where are you taking this <i>thing?</i>
"
,,
6,1,"You think you could get me
"
,,
6,1,"a room by the pool?
"
,,
6,1,"Is funny because you are prisoner.
"
,,
6,1,"And there is no pool because is Death Star.
"
,,
6,1,"what cell the princess is in.
"
,,
6,1," There it is - 2187.
"
,,
6,1,"Everything's under control here.
"
,,
6,1,"Situation normal.
"
,,
6,1," We had a weapons malfunction,
"
,,
6,1,"but everything's perfectly all right.
"
,,
6,1,"We're fine. We're all fine... here... now.
"
,,
6,1,"Thank you. How are you?
"
,,
6,1," Well, tell me what's up.
"
,,
6,1," How long's it been?
"
,,
6,1," How often do you see each other?
"
,,
6,1,"Why don't you try seeing each other
"
,,
6,1,"more often and see if you connect more?
"
,,
6,1,"If not, it may be time to move on.
"
,,
6,1,"Thanks for calling.
"
,,
6,1,"This is Han Solo. I'll be keeping you company
"
,,
6,1,"for the next few hours on the midnight shift.
"
,,
6,1," <i>It's telling me it might be you</i>
"
,,
6,1," Aren't you a little fat to be a stormtrooper?
"
,,
6,1," Stay here and rot, you stuck-up bitch!
"
,,
6,1," Wait. Who are you?
"
,,
6,1," I'm Luke Skywalker.
"
,,
6,1,"Me and Han Solo and Obi-Wan
"
,,
6,1,"are here to rescue you.
"
,,
6,1," Wait. Obi-Wan Kenobi?
"
,,
6,1," Yeah.
"
,,
6,1,"Suddenly I'm not so fat, huh?
"
,,
6,1,"Come on, into the garbage chute.
"
,,
6,1," Come on, Chewbacca.
"
,,
6,1," It's probably full of disease.
"
,,
6,1," I'm notjumping in there.
"
,,
6,1," Not even if I throw this pig's ear?
"
,,
6,1," That's not fair.
"
,,
6,1," Go get it.
"
,,
6,1,"Great idea, Princess -
"
,,
6,1,"diving into a pile of garbage.
"
,,
6,1,"When we get out of here maybe you can show
"
,,
6,1,"me around your home planet of Alderaan. Aw!
"
,,
6,1," Too soon?
"
,,
6,1," Hey, could be worse.
"
,,
6,1," It's worse.
"
,,
6,1," The walls are closing!
"
,,
6,1,"Listen to them, R2. They're dying.
"
,,
6,1,"What do we do?
"
,,
6,1,"Only one thing <i>to</i> do, man.
"
,,
6,1,"You still got that bag I gave you?
"
,,
6,1,"Man, I wish I could listen to some
"
,,
6,1,"Tatooine Wind and Fire right now.
"
,,
6,1,"Mm.
"
,,
6,1,"So you think the Empire's gonna fall, man?
"
,,
6,1,"I-I-I... I don't know, man.
"
,,
6,1,"How you... how you...
"
,,
6,1,"how you doing right now?
"
,,
6,1,"Good. Why?
"
,,
6,1,"I think... I think... I think I may be having
"
,,
6,1,"sort of a mini freakout here.
"
,,
6,1,"Oh!
"
,,
6,1,"Just... just tell me
"
,,
6,1,"I don't have to stay in this room.
"
,,
6,1," What?
"
,,
6,1," Just tell me I don't have to stay in this room.
"
,,
6,1," You don't have to stay in this room.
"
,,
6,1," Oh, thank Christ!
"
,,
6,1,"Thank God! We're saved!
"
,,
6,1,"Look at this! Who throws out half a pizza?
"
,,
6,1,"And look at this couch! Somebody threw out
"
,,
6,1,"a whole couch, and it's in great shape.
"
,,
6,1,"You put Febreze on that, scrub it out
"
,,
6,1,"a bit, it'll look great in your apartment.
"
,,
6,1,"You know what?
"
,,
6,1,"I know we have a dangerous job to do here,
"
,,
6,1,"but I'm taking this. I'm taking this couch.
"
,,
6,1," OK, all right. Easy, easy, easy!
"
,,
6,1," OK. All right.
"
,,
6,1," Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop! Stop! Stop!
"
,,
6,1," What? What?
"
,,
6,1," No, no, twist it.
"
,,
6,1," I am.
"
,,
6,1," No, no, no. No, no, no, no. Other way.
"
,,
6,1," Which way?
"
,,
6,1," What do you want me to do?!
"
,,
6,1," Just look down. Look at what I'm doing.
"
,,
6,1,"See the way I'm twisting it?
"
,,
6,1,"Turn it that way from your end.
"
,,
6,1," OK.
"
,,
6,1," No, no, no, no, no.
"
,,
6,1," What?
"
,,
6,1," Just put it down. Put it down.
"
,,
6,1," Just drop it
"
,,
6,1," All right.
"
,,
6,1,"All right, let's...
"
,,
6,1,"just hang on and figure this out.
"
,,
6,1,"There are stormtroopers all over the place.
"
,,
6,1,"Shouldn't we be getting outta here?
"
,,
6,1,"All right, OK. OK, I got it.
"
,,
6,1,"I know what we...
"
,,
6,1,"We're gonna take the cushions off,
"
,,
6,1,"unscrew the legs, take the mattress out,
"
,,
6,1,"and this whole thing's gonna be a lot simpler.
"
,,
6,1,"It's easier than we're making it.
"
,,
6,1," Hey, did you hear something?
"
,,
6,1," Probably just another drill.
"
,,
6,1,"You know that last drill we had?
"
,,
6,1,"I was about to finally bone my girlfriend,
"
,,
6,1,"then we heard that there was this drill
"
,,
6,1,"and she told me there was no way.
"
,,
6,1,"What part of ""Stay 50 yards away at all times""
"
,,
6,1,"don't you understand?
"
,,
6,1,"Uh-oh!
"
,,
6,1,"Your powers are weak, old man.
"
,,
6,1,"Boy, you got here just in time.
"
,,
6,1,"No!
"
,,
6,1,"All right, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
"
,,
6,1," Counterclockwise.
"
,,
6,1," You're twisting it the other way.
"
,,
6,1,"Counterclockwise from where I'm standing,
"
,,
6,1,"so... so then... so clockwise.
"
,,
6,1,"So, yeah, you twist it clockwise.
"
,,
6,1,"OK, go.
"
,,
6,1,"Put it down for a sec.
"
,,
6,1,"My fingers are killing me.
"
,,
6,1," Han, they're shooting at us!
"
,,
6,1," Lift it up tallways.
"
,,
6,1,"Oh, for Christ's... It's wedged!
"
,,
6,1,"It's not going anywhere.
"
,,
6,1,"Let's just take off. We'll deal with it later.
"
,,
6,1,"You get in the cockpit,
"
,,
6,1,"and I'll just hang onto this thing as we go.
"
,,
6,1,"Easy!
"
,,
6,1,"I can't believe he's gone.
"
,,
6,1,"I know, Luke, but it's true - he's gone.
"
,,
6,1,"I mean, you saw him get beheaded.
"
,,
6,1,"Nobody lives through that.
"
,,
6,1,"Not for long, anyway.
"
,,
6,1,"I mean, sometimes the brain is still active
"
,,
6,1,"for a few minutes after the beheading,
"
,,
6,1,"but to be honest, I can't imagine
"
,,
6,1,"a worse kind of hell.
"
,,
6,1,"And unfortunately,
"
,,
6,1,"hell is probably where he'll end up,
"
,,
6,1,"because the Christians don't look
"
,,
6,1,"too kindly on the whole Force thing.
"
,,
6,1,"Come on, kid. We're not out of the woods yet.
"
,,
6,1,"Here they come.
"
,,
6,1," Hey, Han.
"
,,
6,1," What?
"
,,
6,1," Why do they call 'em TIE fighters?
"
,,
6,1," No idea.
"
,,
6,1,"They're coming too fast!
"
,,
6,1,"A nickel for every time I've had that problem.
"
,,
6,1,"Just keep shooting, Luke.
"
,,
6,1,"Yeah! That's how we do it
"
,,
6,1,"in my neighbourhood, bitch!
"
,,
6,1,"I got him. I got him!
"
,,
6,1,"Don't get penisy.
"
,,
6,1,"I just want to tell you both:
"
,,
6,1,"Good luck, we're all counting on you.
"
,,
6,1,"Mom?
"
,,
6,1,"Yeah, we won.
"
,,
6,1,"Yeah, we won the battle.
"
,,
6,1,"Yeah, I'm calling like you asked.
"
,,
6,1,"OK. OK.
"
,,
6,1,"OK, but... OK, but I gotta go.
"
,,
6,1,"I got other stuff to do.
"
,,
6,1,"OK. OK. OK, but I gotta go.
"
,,
6,1,"OK.
"
,,
6,1,"OK, yes.
"
,,
6,1,"Yes. Yes.
"
,,
6,1,"Yes, Mom. I love you too, Mom.
"
,,
6,1,"Goodbye.
"
,,
6,1,"The homing beacon is safely on board
"
,,
6,1,"the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>
"
,,
6,1,"I'm taking an awful risk, Vader.
"
,,
6,1,"It had better work.
"
,,
6,1," I think they took your old couch.
"
,,
6,1," What?! I threw that away.
"
,,
6,1,"I'd killed Obi-Wan, then I look over and there
"
,,
6,1,"are two dudes scurrying across with a couch.
"
,,
6,1,"It had the stain on it
"
,,
6,1,"from when we had Hawaiian punch night.
"
,,
6,1,"Yeah, that's my couch. Rebel scum!
"
,,
6,1,"Thanks to the information in this R2 unit
"
,,
6,1,"provided by Princess Leia,
"
,,
6,1,"we should be able to mount
"
,,
6,1,"a successful offensive on the Death Star.
"
,,
6,1,"But first, please take a moment
"
,,
6,1,"to watch this instructional video.
"
,,
6,1,"Nothing but net.
"
,,
6,1,"Hi, I'm Magic Johnson with a few tips
"
,,
6,1,"on blowing up the Death Star.
"
,,
6,1,"First off, never forget your objective.
"
,,
6,1,"There are gonna be so many folks
"
,,
6,1,"coming at you to slow you down,
"
,,
6,1,"you might feel like you got
"
,,
6,1,"a bull's-eye on your head.
"
,,
6,1,"No, but they will be trying to kill you.
"
,,
6,1,"Also, don't forget you have teammates
"
,,
6,1,"out there watching your back -
"
,,
6,1,"unless you been messing around
"
,,
6,1,"with their wife or girlfriend!
"
,,
6,1,"No, but they will be there to help you.
"
,,
6,1,"Lastly, you wanna make sure you step back
"
,,
6,1,"and take cover after you sink that bucket,
"
,,
6,1,"cos that sky gonna light up
"
,,
6,1,"like the Fourth of July.
"
,,
6,1,"No, but there will be a large explosion.
"
,,
6,1," Any questions?
"
,,
6,1,"Does Barry Manilow know
"
,,
6,1,"you raid his wardrobe?
"
,,
6,1,"You'll get that answer to that question
"
,,
6,1,"Don't mess with the bull,
"
,,
6,1,"you'll get the horns!
"
,,
6,1,"Biggs? Jesus, what the hell
"
,,
6,1,"happened to you?
"
,,
6,1,"Hey, Luke. I was under a Y-wing,
"
,,
6,1,"working on the space engine,
"
,,
6,1,"and the whole thing just dropped on me.
"
,,
6,1," Holy crap!
"
,,
6,1," Yeah, holy crap.
"
,,
6,1,"So, you here for the Death Star assault?
"
,,
6,1,"Yeah. Yeah, I can't wait. How about you?
"
,,
6,1," Well, no, I can't really...
"
,,
6,1," Oh, yeah, because of the...
"
,,
6,1," The chair.
"
,,
6,1,"...chair, yeah.
"
,,
6,1,"So I'll just be here making sandwiches
"
,,
6,1,"for when you guys get back.
"
,,
6,1,"Oh! Well... well, that's cool.
"
,,
6,1,"Yeah. You want anything special?
"
,,
6,1," What? You mean, like, a sandwich?
"
,,
6,1," Yeah.
"
,,
6,1,"Oh, no. I mean, I couldn't.
"
,,
6,1,"Whatever you make will be fine.
"
,,
6,1," Hey, Biggs.
"
,,
6,1," Yeah?
"
,,
6,1,"You're just as big a part of this as...
"
,,
6,1,"I mean, you're doing stuff and...
"
,,
6,1,"and I think that's great.
"
,,
6,1,"Well, kid, I guess this is goodbye.
"
,,
6,1,"So you got your reward
"
,,
6,1,"and you're leaving, is that it?
"
,,
6,1,"When you say it that way,
"
,,
6,1,"I sound like a douche, but yeah.
"
,,
6,1,"What did you get for a reward, anyway?
"
,,
6,1,"Let's see, I got 10% off
"
,,
6,1,"a Netflix membership, um...
"
,,
6,1,"some nice Cracker Barrel Cheddar,
"
,,
6,1,"assorted lotions, and a little plastic
"
,,
6,1,"champagne bottle full ofjellybeans,
"
,,
6,1,"and a little bear.
"
,,
6,1,"See? Little bear?
"
,,
6,1,"we had fun on the Death Star.
"
,,
6,1,"Well, take care of yourself, Han.
"
,,
6,1,"I guess that's what you're best at.
"
,,
6,1,"Oh, look, a lightsaber cheese knife.
"
,,
6,1,"Mm... Yuck!
"
,,
6,1," All wings, check in.
"
,,
6,1," Red Three standing by.
"
,,
6,1," Red Six standing by.
"
,,
6,1," Red Five standing by.

"
,,
6,1,"Well, Dad, thanks for keeping us entertained.
"
,,
6,1,"That was a great story.
"
,,
6,1,"Yeah. But didn't <i>Robot Chicken</i>
"
,,
6,1,"already do this three months ago?
"
,,
6,1,"Don't worry about it. I don't think people
"
,,
6,1,"are even aware of that show's existence.
"
,,
6,1," I think a decent number of people watch it.
"
,,
6,1," Oh, really? Define ""decent"".
"
,,
6,1,"It's the highest-rated show
"
,,
6,1,"on Cartoon Network,
"
,,
6,1,"and the <i>Star Wars</i> episode
"
,,
6,1,"doubled that audience.
"
,,
6,1,"Well, yeah, but double ten people
"
,,
6,1,"is 20 people.
"
,,
6,1,"What kind of numbers
"
,,
6,1,"are we talking about here?
"
,,
6,1,"Don't be glib about this stuff. It's a legitimate
"
,,
6,1,"show, and they beat you to the punch.
"
,,
6,1,"I don't know about that, Chris. To me,
"
,,
6,1,"a legitimate show is on ABC, CBS, NBC.
"
,,
6,1," One of the real networks.
"
,,
6,1," I don't know about that, Dad.
"
,,
6,1,"Besides, what's up with
"
,,
6,1,"that 15-minute run time?
"
,,
6,1,"What is that? 15 minutes of guys playing
"
,,
6,1,"with <i>Star Wars</i> dolls? ""Oh, yay...""
"
,,
6,1,"Oh, so you <i>do</i> know the show!
"

"

6,2,"you were going to cure my cancer,
"

"

"

6,2,"Well, you're right, about the rape part,

"

6,2,"Really? Where did you read that?
"

"
,,
6,2,"Jillian, can you, uh, run and
"

"

6,2," Uh...
"

6,2,"Well, Peter, if you want,
"

6,2,"you can have my ticket.
"

6,2,"What? But, Brian,
"

"

6,2,"Ready.
"
,,
6,2,"Meg, lend me 25 cents

6,2,"What is this?
"

6,2,"It's a pamphlet on why I'm bombing you.

6,2," Hey, Meg.
"
,,
6,2," Hi, Carl.
"
,,
6,2,"How come you're always here by yourself?
"
,,
6,2,"Are you like a bitch or something?
"
,,
6,2," No, I have friends.
"
,,
6,2," Oh.
"
,,
6,2,"Well, you should bring
"
,,
6,2,"some of them in here.
"
,,
6,2," Any of them have braces?
"
,,
6,2," Yeah.
"

6,2,"I love braces.
"

"

6,2,"I need disposable diapers,

"

6,2,"Oh, Vince Vaughn's on the cover

6,2,"of Entertainment Weekly.

"
,,
6,2,"""Oh, I'm incapable
"
,,
6,2,"of loving another person.""
"
,,
6,2,"""Oh, wait, no, I'm not. The end.""
"
,,
6,2,"I don't even want to look at his face.
"
,,
6,2,"Stewie, what the hell are you doing?!
"
,,
6,2,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
6,2,"Now I've got to clean up this up!
"
,,
6,2," Carl, I'm so sorry.
"
,,
6,2," Wow, Meg,
"
,,
6,2,"you alphabetized all the magazines.
"
,,
6,2," Hey, you want a job?
"
,,
6,2," What? Me?
"
,,
6,2," Here? Yeah, sure!
"
,,
6,2," Great. You start tomorrow.
"
,,
6,2," Hey, Chris.
"
,,
6,2," Hey, Meg.
"
,,
6,2,"I don't have any money
"
,,
6,2,"so I'm going to have to pay
"
,,
6,2,"for these comic books with my poo.
"
,,
6,2,"Chris, how come you don't have any
"
,,
6,2,"money? I thought you had a paper route.
"
,,
6,2,"Well, I'm taking a sabbatical
"
,,
6,2,"to focus on my pottery.
"
,,
6,2,"Oh.
"
,,
6,2," How's that working out?
"
,,
6,2," Not good, Meg, not good.
"
,,
6,2,"Well, maybe I can talk to Carl
"
,,
6,2,"and get you a job here.
"
,,
6,2," You could do that?!
"
,,
6,2," Absolutely.
"
,,
6,2,"Carl totally trusts me.
"
,,
6,2,"You and I will be the best brother-sister
"
,,
6,2,"team since Maggie and Jake Gyllenhaal.
"
,,
6,2," I'm more off-putting.
"
,,
6,2," No, I'm more off-putting.
"
,,
6,2,"I'm more unattractive
"
,,
6,2,"to put in a lead role.
"
,,
6,2,"Well, I'm a bigger box office drag.
"
,,
6,2,"Kids, kids. You're both...
"
,,
6,2,"...just awful.
"
,,
6,2,"Oh, hi, Brian.
"
,,
6,2,"I thought you were spending
"
,,
6,2,"the day with Jillian.
"
,,
6,2,"I was, but Peter took her off my hands.
"
,,
6,2,"Perfect timing. I've been feeling
"
,,
6,2,"a little smothered lately.
"
,,
6,2,"Plus, it's given me a chance
"
,,
6,2,"to work on my novel.
"
,,
6,2," And I finally have a title.
"
,,
6,2," Oh, what is it?
"
,,
6,2,"""Faster Than the Speed of Love.""
"
,,
6,2,"That is the worst title I've ever heard.
"
,,
6,2,"No, it's the story of a boy
"
,,
6,2,"who has to rescue his father,
"
,,
6,2,"who's a pilot, that's been taken captive
"
,,
6,2,"by a militant Islamic country.
"
,,
6,2," That's the movie Iron Eagle!
"
,,
6,2," What?
"
,,
6,2,"Is that, is that a recent film?
"
,,
6,2,"They made three sequels!
"
,,
6,2,"Yeah, well, in mine, the boy's gotta
"
,,
6,2,"gather all these old World War II pilots
"
,,
6,2,"to help him rescue his father.
"
,,
6,2,"That's one of the sequels!
"
,,
6,2,"Well, well, in mine,
"
,,
6,2,"one of the World War II guys is Japanese,
"
,,
6,2,"but they accept him anyway.
"
,,
6,2,"I'm going to pee in my pants!
"
,,
6,2,"Boy, it sure is fun
"
,,
6,2,"hanging out with you, Peter.
"
,,
6,2,"That means ""thank you""
"
,,
6,2,"in my new language I'm inventing.
"
,,
6,2,"Anyway, all I was saying is,
"
,,
6,2,"if you think about it,
"
,,
6,2,"it shouldn't have been
"
,,
6,2,"Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
"
,,
6,2,"It should've been
"
,,
6,2,"Ferris Bueller's Day On,
"
,,
6,2,"'cause that was all the stuff
"
,,
6,2,"he wanted to do.
"
,,
6,2,"Yeah. And he was so ""on"" that day,
"
,,
6,2,"so it kind of works on two levels.
"
,,
6,2,"Well, I don't know what you mean by
"
,,
6,2,"that, but how about that Cameron, huh?
"
,,
6,2," Oh, definitely.
"
,,
6,2," Am I right?
"
,,
6,2,"It was his day off, too.
"
,,
6,2,"That is just what I was going to...
"
,,
6,2,"His day off...
"
,,
6,2,"that is just what I was going to say.
"
,,
6,2,"You know, you are a catch, young lady.
"
,,
6,2,"You know that?
"
,,
6,2,"I don't know when the hell
"
,,
6,2,"Brian is going to open his eyes
"
,,
6,2,"and get serious with you.
"
,,
6,2,"I really wish he would.
"
,,
6,2,"It'd be so great if we were
"
,,
6,2,"at least living together.
"
,,
6,2,"Well, you need to just lay it
"
,,
6,2,"on the line with him.
"
,,
6,2,"Either he commits to you,
"
,,
6,2,"or you're gone.
"
,,
6,2,"What the hell did you do?!
"
,,
6,2,"Because of what you said,
"
,,
6,2,"Jillian wants us to move in together!
"
,,
6,2,"Well, I think you should, Brian.
"
,,
6,2,"She's beautiful, she's funny,
"
,,
6,2,"and she is smart as the day is wide.
"
,,
6,2,"Don't you understand?! I don't want a
"
,,
6,2,"committed relationship with Jillian.
"
,,
6,2,"Well, it sounds like she does.
"
,,
6,2,"And if you're never going to get serious,
"
,,
6,2,"then you're not being fair to her.
"
,,
6,2,"You don't really think
"
,,
6,2,"I'm like that, do you?
"
,,
6,2,"Prove me wrong.
"
,,
6,2,"All right, I will, Lois.
"
,,
6,2,"I will ask her to move in with me.
"
,,
6,2,"and you'll see, I've got what it takes.
"
,,
6,2,"Boy, you know, I gotta tell you, Jillian,
"
,,
6,2,"this move is really working out great.
"
,,
6,2," It just feels right, you know.
"
,,
6,2," Cool!
"
,,
6,2," Rock on, Brian!
"
,,
6,2," Okay, done.
"
,,
6,2,"Stewie. Hey. What's up?
"
,,
6,2,"Oh, I was just on my way back
"
,,
6,2,"from the cobbler.
"
,,
6,2,"Figured before I stopped
"
,,
6,2,"by the apothecary,
"
,,
6,2,"I'd come here, and then
"
,,
6,2,"it's off to the haberdasher.
"
,,
6,2,"These turn-of-the-century business jokes
"
,,
6,2,"doing anything for you?
"
,,
6,2,"Not really.
"
,,
6,2," Did you use the jokes?
"
,,
6,2," Yeah, they're not landing.
"
,,
6,2,"Got your mail. So, how's it going?
"
,,
6,2,"I tell you, Stewie, it's going great.
"
,,
6,2,"And that's the worst part.
"
,,
6,2,"I can't afford the rent.
"
,,
6,2,"I'll be lucky if I can make it
"
,,
6,2,"to the end of the month.
"
,,
6,2,"Sounds like you need a roommate.
"
,,
6,2,"Where did you get that kind of money?
"
,,
6,2,"I picked up Chris's paper route.
"
,,
6,2,"Oh, OshKosh B'Gosh,
"
,,
6,2,"it's a brand-new paperboy.
"
,,
6,2,"That's a mighty full sack
"
,,
6,2,"you're carrying.
"
,,
6,2,"Piss off, you perverted old freak!
"
,,
6,2,"Oh, we got a fighter.
"
,,
6,2,"Wow, you were almost in a dirt bike race?
"
,,
6,2,"Yeah, yeah, I filled out
"
,,
6,2,"most of the paperwork, too.
"
,,
6,2,"You are the coolest guy I have ever met.
"
,,
6,2,"Yep.
"
,,
6,2,"Hey, guys.
"
,,
6,2,"Um...
"
,,
6,2,"Chris, I need you to stack the boxes
"
,,
6,2,"in the back for me.
"
,,
6,2,"Uh, you know what, Meg?
"
,,
6,2,"Why don't you do that?
"
,,
6,2,"I need Chris up here with me.
"
,,
6,2,"But the boxes are really heavy.
"
,,
6,2,"Oh, that's 'cause there's
"
,,
6,2,"a bunch of stuff in them.
"
,,
6,2,"Huh? Chris?
"
,,
6,2,"Yeah.
"
,,
6,2,"Uh, Chris, you ever see
"
,,
6,2,"the movie Cruel Intentions?
"
,,
6,2,"No.
"
,,
6,2,"Oh, Selma Blair and
"
,,
6,2,"Sarah Michelle Gellar make out.
"
,,
6,2,"It's pretty hot.
"
,,
6,2," 47 minutes, 16 seconds in.
"
,,
6,2," No way!
"
,,
6,2,"Yeah, yeah.
"
,,
6,2,"You know what's another great movie?
"
,,
6,2,"Career Opportunities
"
,,
6,2,"with Jennifer Connelly.
"
,,
6,2,"I mean, that's one of
"
,,
6,2,"those movies that...
"
,,
6,2,"I mean, she's really hot in it, but
"
,,
6,2,"it's also a good movie.
"
,,
6,2,"She was in A Beautiful Mind,
"
,,
6,2,"and I've gotta say,
"
,,
6,2,"the direction was excellent but
"
,,
6,2,"I was very disappointed that she, um...
"
,,
6,2,"wore clothes the entire film.
"
,,
6,2,"Was she hot in it?
"
,,
6,2,"Yeah, in the way that, like,
"
,,
6,2,"classy women with expensive clothing
"
,,
6,2,"who never take the moff are hot,
"
,,
6,2,"you know?
"
,,
6,2,"No.
"
,,
6,2,"All right.
"
,,
6,2,"So, like, you see a hotgirl,
"
,,
6,2,"and you're like, okay, I appreciate
"
,,
6,2,"your exterior beauty
"
,,
6,2,"'cause you definitely worked at it
"
,,
6,2,"with the clothing, and the jewelry,
"
,,
6,2,"and the makeup and stuff,
"
,,
6,2,"but secretly, I'm just like, hey, man...
"
,,
6,2,"where is the chase and
"
,,
6,2,"how do I cut to it?
"
,,
6,2,"Wow, you're smart.
"
,,
6,2,"What?
"
,,
6,2,"Listen, I hope you don't mind Stewie
"
,,
6,2,"staying with us for a little while.
"
,,
6,2,"He, uh, he just gets really lonely
"
,,
6,2,"without me at home.
"
,,
6,2,"You're so fatherly.
"
,,
6,2,"It really turns me on.
"
,,
6,2,"They're in the cabinet!
"
,,
6,2,"They're right in front of you!
"
,,
6,2,"Which cabinet are you looking at?!
"
,,
6,2," No, I'm busy!
"
,,
6,2,"Oh, Brian, we need paper towels!</i>
"
,,
6,2,"Just use a dish towel!
"
,,
6,2,"You need to come in here!</i>
"
,,
6,2,"Oh-ho, a hundred points!
"
,,
6,2,"Meg, clean up aisle two.
"
,,
6,2,"What the hell is this?!
"
,,
6,2,"I am not cleaning this up.
"
,,
6,2,"Meg, less talkie, more sweepy.
"
,,
6,2,"Shut up, Chris!
"
,,
6,2,"You can't tell me what to do.
"
,,
6,2,"Uh, actually, Meg,
"
,,
6,2,"as your supervisor, he can.
"
,,
6,2,"Supervisor?
"
,,
6,2," Yeah, I promoted him this morning.
"
,,
6,2," Promoted me this morning.
"
,,
6,2,"What?!
"
,,
6,2,"Carl, you promised me that
"
,,
6,2,"assistant manager position.
"
,,
6,2,"Uh, Meg, things change.
"
,,
6,2,"Hey, you ever see
"
,,
6,2,"Broken Lizard's Club Dread?
"
,,
6,2,"No.
"
,,
6,2,"Well, go see that movie
"
,,
6,2,"and absorb its message,
"
,,
6,2,"and you'll get the gist
"
,,
6,2,"of what I'm talking about.
"
,,
6,2," Carl, this isn't fair!
"
,,
6,2," All right, then, you're fired.
"
,,
6,2,"What?
"
,,
6,2,"But...
"
,,
6,2,"No, you can't...
"
,,
6,2,"Don't worry about it, Chris,
"
,,
6,2,"she'll be fine.
"
,,
6,2,"Hey, by the way, you know who else
"
,,
6,2,"is hot in kind of a screwed up way?
"
,,
6,2,"Mary Stuart Masterson.
"
,,
6,2,"Yeah, yeah, in that sort of
"
,,
6,2,"""you think you could get her,""
"
,,
6,2,"""cause she could be your brother""
"
,,
6,2,"kind of thing.
"
,,
6,2,"Like, she's gettable, you know,
"
,,
6,2,"like, like, Elizabeth Shue.
"
,,
6,2," Oh, I remember her.
"
,,
6,2," Yeah.
"
,,
6,2,"You know, she was in Leaving Las Vegas
"
,,
6,2,"in addition to Adventures in Babysitting.
"
,,
6,2,"One of those underrated actresses
"
,,
6,2,"that was always talented and beautiful,
"
,,
6,2,"and never quite popped,
"
,,
6,2,"if you know the meaning.
"
,,
6,2," Who, Elizabeth Shue?
"
,,
6,2," Yeah.
"
,,
6,2,"Like totally naked in, um,
"
,,
6,2,"Leaving Las Vegas.
"
,,
6,2,"And, uh, still ,still so hot.
"
,,
6,2,"Like, uh...
"
,,
6,2," I don't see art films.
"
,,
6,2," Like, like, crazy hot.
"
,,
6,2,"Yeah, it's about 39 minutes,
"
,,
6,2,"It's a really exceptional sequence.
"
,,
6,2,"I mean, Nick Cage is poisoning himself
"
,,
6,2,"with alcohol.
"
,,
6,2,"He's a failed writer
"
,,
6,2,"who just decides that,
"
,,
6,2,"""Ooh, I'm going to have
"
,,
6,2,"a big last hurrah in Las Vegas.""
"
,,
6,2,"And then he meets a whore and pays her
"
,,
6,2,"a bunch of money to stay with him,
"
,,
6,2,"uh, and have sex with him
"
,,
6,2,"while he murders himself slowly.
"
,,
6,2,"And, you know, she's game for it, but
"
,,
6,2,"she catches feelings midway through
"
,,
6,2,"and the whole thing changes.
"
,,
6,2,"Wow, h-have youseen Cocktail?
"
,,
6,2," Uh, yeah, yeah.
"
,,
6,2," She was in that.
"
,,
6,2," She was in that.
"
,,
6,2," Yeah.
"
,,
6,2," Ah, ah, you like that?
"
,,
6,2," Yeah, it's rad!
"
,,
6,2,"Don't talk, please.
"
,,
6,2,"Hang on, let me get a condom.
"
,,
6,2,"Brian, are you guys up?
"
,,
6,2,"Stewie, what the hell are you doing?
"
,,
6,2,"Go back to bed.
"
,,
6,2,"But I'm not tired.
"
,,
6,2,"And I'm lonely.
"
,,
6,2,"Oh, come get in bed with us.
"
,,
6,2,"Ooh, all right, ""Dear Penthouse Forum.""
"
,,
6,2,"No, no, Stewie, go away!
"
,,
6,2,"Brian, don't be mean to him.
"
,,
6,2,"Yes, Brian, if you're mean to me,
"
,,
6,2,"I'll stop paying the rent.
"
,,
6,2," What did he say?
"
,,
6,2," Uh, nothing.
"
,,
6,2,"That's right, I'm paying
"
,,
6,2,"Mr. Lickity-self's half of the rent.
"
,,
6,2,"Is that true?
"
,,
6,2,"All right, yes, fine, it's true!
"
,,
6,2,"Why didn't you say anything?
"
,,
6,2,"Because you wanted me to move in so
"
,,
6,2,"badly, and God knows, I didn't want to...
"
,,
6,2,"Wait...
"
,,
6,2,"You didn't want to move in with me?
"
,,
6,2,"Well, honestly, no.
"
,,
6,2,"Oh, my God! I've never felt so stupid!
"
,,
6,2," Really?
"
,,
6,2," Really?
"
,,
6,2,"Well, I don't want to be
"
,,
6,2,"your guilty burden, Brian!
"
,,
6,2,"We're through!
"
,,
6,2,"Jillian, wait!
"
,,
6,2,"Damn it.
"
,,
6,2,"I'm sorry, Brian.
"
,,
6,2,"You'll feel better in the morning.
"
,,
6,2,"She's gone.
"
,,
6,2,"Jillian's gone.
"
,,
6,2,"Look, Brian, I know you're upset now,
"
,,
6,2,"but I think it's important
"
,,
6,2,"to see things in perspective.
"
,,
6,2,"Remember when Alex P. Keaton
"
,,
6,2,"lost his girlfriend?
"
,,
6,2,"And then he got another one,
"
,,
6,2,"and everything was all right?
"
,,
6,2,"And then he got Parkinson's.
"
,,
6,2,"Yikes.
"
,,
6,2,"You know, Stewie, you're right.
"
,,
6,2,"This is not a loss, it's an opportunity.
"
,,
6,2,"I'm free now.
"
,,
6,2,"I've got my own place, no attachments.
"
,,
6,2,"There you are. That's just the kind
"
,,
6,2,"of can-do spirit that built this nation.
"
,,
6,2,"""We hold these truths
"
,,
6,2,"to be self-evident,""
"
,,
6,2,"""that all men are created equal.""
"
,,
6,2," Except the Jews.
"
,,
6,2," Franklin, for the fifth time,
"
,,
6,2,"I'm sorry you overpaid for your house,
"
,,
6,2,"but it's not going in.
"
,,
6,2," You'll be sorry.
"
,,
6,2," Noted. Moving on.
"
,,
6,2,"So, Meg, any luck finding another job?
"
,,
6,2,"No.
"
,,
6,2,"Hardly anybody's hiring right now.
"
,,
6,2,"The only job I could find was for
"
,,
6,2,"a phone sex line, and I sucked at it.
"
,,
6,2,"What am I wearing?
"
,,
6,2,"Um...
"
,,
6,2,"a hat...
"
,,
6,2,"and...
"
,,
6,2,"glasses.
"
,,
6,2,"What kind of underwear?
"
,,
6,2,"Um...
"
,,
6,2,"I don't know.
"
,,
6,2,"Big underwear, I guess.
"
,,
6,2,"I'm sorry, what?
"
,,
6,2,"Oh, what would I do to you?
"
,,
6,2,"Well, um...
"
,,
6,2,"I guess maybe we'd get pizza.
"
,,
6,2,"And...
"
,,
6,2,"we could watch House.
"
,,
6,2,"All right, I am totally flaccid,
"
,,
6,2,"but thank you anyway, m'am,
"
,,
6,2,"I appreciated your time.
"
,,
6,2,"Mom, check it out!
"
,,
6,2,"I just got my paycheck and my salary's
"
,,
6,2,"doubled ever since Meg got fired.
"
,,
6,2,"Oh, shut up, you bastard!
"
,,
6,2,"Chris, we should have a talk about Meg.
"
,,
6,2,"She's really upset that she got fired.
"
,,
6,2,"Gee, I didn't realize working at
"
,,
6,2,"the store meant that much to her.
"
,,
6,2,"You know, it would mean the world to her
"
,,
6,2,"if she could get her job back.
"
,,
6,2,"And you'd be one terrific brother
"
,,
6,2,"if you could help her.
"
,,
6,2,"Well, gosh, Mom, I'll sure try.
"
,,
6,2,"Poor Meg.
"
,,
6,2,"She got a worse deal than that

"
,,
6,2,"for this scrappy, little no-armed man</i>
"
,,
6,2,"two-armed player would've made the catch.</i>
"
,,
6,2,"would have at least had a shot at it,</i>
"
,,
6,2,"the question once again,</i>
"
,,
6,2,"waiting in the minor leagues,</i>
"
,,
6,2,"an arm-less second baseman?</i>
"
,,
6,2," In ever, Jerry. In ever.</i>
"
,,
6,2,"What the hell?! What are you people
"
,,
6,2,"doing in my apartment?
"
,,
6,2,"Hey!
"
,,
6,2,"You made it.
"
,,
6,2,"What is all this? What's going on?
"
,,
6,2,"You, that's what's going on.
"
,,
6,2,"Come on, time for you to meet some women
"
,,
6,2,"who are going to make you forget
"
,,
6,2,"about Jillian.
"
,,
6,2,"Looks like there's
"
,,
6,2,"a lot of gay guys here.
"
,,
6,2,"Yeah, everybody's having a good time.
"
,,
6,2,"Brian, I want to introduce you to Joanna.
"
,,
6,2,"Look out for this one,
"
,,
6,2,"she's a bit of a card.
"
,,
6,2,"Okay, here's one for you.
"
,,
6,2,"What food can't make up its mind?
"
,,
6,2,"This is going to be good.
"
,,
6,2,"A waffle.
"
,,
6,2,"This one.
"
,,
6,2,"Didn't I warn you, right?
"
,,
6,2,"Right?
"
,,
6,2,"How are you still single?
"
,,
6,2,"Hey there, buddy.
"
,,
6,2,"Check it out. Check it out.
"
,,
6,2,"I put a cruller in the Jerry's Kids' jar.
"
,,
6,2," I thought that would be funny.
"
,,
6,2," That is hilarious, but, 
"
,,
6,2,"Carl, I want you to hire my sister back.
"
,,
6,2,"No, Chris, she's a pain in the ass.
"
,,
6,2,"I-I don't want her back in here.
"
,,
6,2,"Well, that's a shame, because
"
,,
6,2,"I watched Event Horizon last night.
"
,,
6,2,"No way! We have to talk about it!
"
,,
6,2,"Yeah, well, my memory is,
"
,,
6,2,"uh, kind of hazy.
"
,,
6,2,"We have to talk about every scene, man!
"
,,
6,2,"Hey, hey, hey!
"
,,
6,2,"Remember when
"
,,
6,2,"Jack Noseworthy's eyes explode?
"
,,
6,2,"Wasn't that awesome?!
"
,,
6,2,"Please agree with me that
"
,,
6,2,"that was awesome!
"
,,
6,2,"Well, if you hire Meg back,
"
,,
6,2,"maybe I'll have an opinion.
"
,,
6,2,"She's hired, she's hired!
"
,,
6,2,"What do you think of it?
"
,,
6,2," It was awesome!
"
,,
6,2," Wasn't it awesome?!
"
,,
6,2," It was totally awesome!
"
,,
6,2," It was the most awesome thing ever!
"
,,
6,2,"Hug me!
"
,,
6,2,"Hey, how you doing, Brian?
"
,,
6,2,"Lousy.
"
,,
6,2,"I know who can cheer you up.
"
,,
6,2,"The robot from Space Camp.
"
,,
6,2,"Get that out of here.
"
,,
6,2,"Okay, how about the robot from Rocky IV?
"
,,
6,2,"Look, Stewie, get these
"
,,
6,2,"stupid '80s movie robots out of here,
"
,,
6,2,"and leave me alone.
"
,,
6,2,"It's all your fault that Jillian's gone.
"
,,
6,2,"My fault?!
"
,,
6,2,"Brian, you've got no one
"
,,
6,2,"to blame but yourself.
"
,,
6,2,"You let the fat man talk you
"
,,
6,2,"into moving out.
"
,,
6,2,"You let Jillian walk out the door.
"
,,
6,2,"Stop getting pushed around.
"
,,
6,2,"Be a man.
"
,,
6,2,"If you want her, go get her.
"
,,
6,2,"You know something?
"
,,
6,2,"You are absolutely right.
"
,,
6,2,"It is time for me
"
,,
6,2," to take charge of my own life.
"
,,
6,2,"Stand aside,
"
,,
6,2,"I've got to get my girl back.
"
,,
6,2,"Go get her, Brian.
"
,,
6,2,"Uh, hi.
"
,,
6,2,"Hi, Brian.
"
,,
6,2,"What are you doing here?
"
,,
6,2,"Jillian,
"
,,
6,2,"look, I made a huge mistake.
"
,,
6,2,"I don't want to lose you.
"
,,
6,2,"You know, you really hurt me, Brian.
"
,,
6,2,"And I can't let you do that again.
"
,,
6,2,"Look, I won't. I promise.
"
,,
6,2,"I don't know how to tell you this,
"
,,
6,2,"but you're too late.
"
,,
6,2,"I met someone else.
"
,,
6,2,"Jillian, do you get the Oxygen Network?
"
,,
6,2,"If I miss my Moesha, I get a bit crabby.
"
,,
6,2,"In a minute, Adam.
"
,,
6,2,"Well...
"
,,
6,2,"I guess this is good-bye.
"
,,
6,2,"Please don't send me away.
"
,,
6,2,"I have to.
"
,,
6,2,"You broke my heart.
"
,,
6,2,"Well, Meg, you got your job back.
"
,,
6,2,"Actually, Chris, I don't.
"
,,
6,2,"I really appreciate what you did for me,
"
,,
6,2,"but I can't work for that guy anymore.
"
,,
6,2,"He's a freak.
"
,,
6,2,"The important thing is
"
,,
6,2,"that you stood up for me.
"
,,
6,2,"And I won't forget it.
"
,,
6,2,"Oh, Brian, I know you miss Jillian,
"
,,
6,2,"but it is good to have you back.
"
,,
6,2,"Kind of sucks though.
"
,,
6,2,"I mean, you are never going
"
,,
6,2,"to find a chick that hot again.
"
,,
6,2,"You know what the mistake was,
"
,,
6,2,"moving in together.
"
,,
6,2,"Well, it's just another
"
,,
6,2,"life experience, I guess.
"
,,
6,2,"Hey, and look on the bright side. Maybe
"
,,
6,2,"you got another chapter for your book.

"

6,3,"Yeah, sorry Joe, I just had
"

6,3,"one of my Scrubs fantasy moments.
"
,,
6,3,"It's the best show you're not watching.
"
,,
6,3,"I hate shows that cut away

"
,,
6,3,"Fellas, our way of life
"
,,
6,3,"is being threatened
"
,,

"
,,
6,3,"Couldn't we just ask the women to leave?
"
,,
6,3,"No, no.
"
,,
6,3,"I got something way more expensive
"
,,
6,3,"and time-consuming in mind.
"
,,
6,3,"Well men,
"
,,
6,3,"the Quahog Men's Club is complete.
"
,,
6,3,"It took six weeks and cost $8,000,
"
,,
6,3,"but it was worth it.
"
,,
6,3,"Peter, I wish you'd get rid of
"
,,
6,3,"this thing. It's an absolute eye sore.
"
,,
6,3,"What do you care, Lois?
"
,,
6,3,"You girls got the Clam,
"
,,
6,3,"we got the Quahog Men's Club.
"
,,
6,3,"Besides we not hurting anybody.
"
,,
6,3,"What are you talking about?
"
,,
6,3,"You ripped a whole chunk of wall
"
,,
6,3,"out of the house!
"
,,
6,3,"What is this?!
"
,,
6,3,"There's something wrong with the house!
"
,,
6,3,"I don't like change!
"
,,
6,3,"Peter, you can't just slap together
"
,,
6,3,"flimsy structures in the yard.
"
,,
6,3,"Why not? Herbert did it.
"
,,
6,3,"Y-M-C-A
"
,,
6,3,"It's fun to stay at the

"
,,
6,3,"All right, Peter, this is a tough one.
"
,,
6,3,"All right you ready for this? Okay,
"
,,
6,3,"would you have sex with Cleveland.
"
,,
6,3,"if it meant you could have sex
"
,,
6,3,"with Angelina Jolie.
"
,,
6,3,"Yeah, yeah, I'd probably do it.
"
,,
6,3,"Hang on, hang on.
"
,,
6,3,"Missionary,
"

6,3,"and pretending it's somebody else.
"
,,
6,3," I think still yes.
"
,,
6,3," Thank you, Peter.
"
,,
6,3,"All right, here's another one.
"
,,
6,3,"Who would you rather have sex with?
"
,,
6,3,"A very pregnant Gina Gershon
"
,,
6,3,"or Jenny McCarthy after a car accident?
"
,,
6,3,"Well, hang on, hang on...
"
,,
6,3,"You know,
"
,,
6,3,"I know this is a men's club but
"
,,
6,3,"why does it always have to be about sex?
"
,,
6,3,"Okay, look,
"
,,
6,3,"how about this, how about this?
"
,,
6,3,"Who would you rather start
"
,,
6,3,"a small business with,
"
,,
6,3,"Janet Reno after a safari,
"
,,
6,3,"or the fat guy from My Name is Earl?
"
,,
6,3,"That still sounds like a sex question.
"
,,
6,3,"It is not.
"
,,
6,3,"Well, then, what the hell does
"
,,
6,3,"""safari"" have to do with it?
"
,,
6,3,"What's the guy from
"
,,
6,3,"Earl's credit rating?
"
,,
6,3," That's not bad.
"
,,
6,3," Better than mine.
"
,,
6,3,"Does he have an idea,
"
,,
6,3,"or do I have to come up with it myself?
"
,,
6,3,"He's got an idea,
"
,,
6,3,"but it's not quite there.
"
,,
6,3,"I'd have to give it to Janet Reno,
"
,,
6,3,"'cause I've always had this business plan
"
,,
6,3,"for a home delivery
"
,,
6,3,"of prescription medications,
"
,,
6,3,"and that seems like
"
,,
6,3,"it's more her market.
"
,,
6,3,"This is stupid!
"
,,
6,3,"I want to talk about vaginas!
"
,,
6,3,"Well, I'd say the men's club
"
,,
6,3,"inaugural ball is a huge success.
"
,,
6,3,"Hey, guys, let's play a party game.

,,
6,3,"Let's go stand over near Brian,
"
,,
6,3,"and we'll take a drink
"
,,
6,3,"every time he says ""bonerific.""
"
,,
6,3," Bonerific?
"
,,
6,3," Yeah, it's his catchphrase.
"
,,
6,3,"He says it all the time.
"
,,
6,3," Yeah, sure, I'm in.
"
,,
6,3," Okay.
"
,,
6,3,"Yeah, let's do it!
"
,,
6,3,"Hey, hey, Brian,
"
,,
6,3,"how you feeling tonight?
"
,,
6,3,"Good. Having a nice time.
"
,,
6,3,"Are you feeling terrific,
"
,,
6,3,"or any variation on that word?
"
,,
6,3,"Oh, sure. No complaints.
"
,,
6,3,"My skin's a little dry.
"
,,
6,3,"He's not saying it, Peter.
"
,,
6,3,"What?
"
,,
6,3,"No. Why would I say that?
"
,,
6,3,"It's not even a word.
"
,,
6,3," What isn't a word?
"
,,
6,3," Bonerific.
"
,,
6,3,"Did I tell you?!
"
,,
6,3,"You can't keep this guy from saying it!
"
,,
6,3,"Boy, great party, huh, Fred?
"
,,
6,3,"Yeah. You know, Barn,
"
,,
6,3,"I figure I ought to tell you this.
"
,,
6,3,"I was walking by your house
"
,,
6,3,"the other day,
"
,,
6,3,"and, uh, I poked my head in the window
"
,,
6,3,"and Betty was undressing.
"
,,
6,3,"Uh, she saw me there,
"
,,
6,3,"but she didn't stop.
"
,,
6,3,"What?
"
,,
6,3,"She didn't stop. I mean,
"
,,
6,3,"she saw me there,
"
,,
6,3,"looking at her and she kept undressing.
"
,,
6,3," Whoa, whoa, whoa, are you serious?
"
,,
6,3," Yeah.
"
,,
6,3,"I got an erocktion.
"
,,
6,3,"I got a headache.
"
,,
6,3,"Do you have any Anacin?
"
,,
6,3,"Any what?
"
,,
6,3," Anacin?
"
,,
6,3," Yeah, Anacin.
"
,,
6,3," Do they even make Anacin anymore?
"
,,
6,3," Yeah, it's still around.
"
,,
6,3," Why?
"
,,
6,3," No, it just...
"
,,
6,3,"seems like sort of a '70s medication.
"
,,
6,3,"So, you don't have any Anacin?
"
,,
6,3,"No.
"
,,
6,3,"God, you're more worthless
"
,,
6,3,"than Colin Farrell.
"
,,
6,3,"So, uh...
"
,,
6,3,"Got the wool cap on, huh?
"
,,
6,3,"Yeah...
"
,,
6,3,"Yeah, I guess, you know,
"
,,
6,3,"whatever, it's 96 degrees out.
"
,,
6,3,"Yeah, you'd better put on
"
,,
6,3,"the old wool cap.
"
,,
6,3,"Yeah.
"
,,
6,3,"You got a lot going on under there, huh,
"
,,
6,3,"under... under the wool cap?
"
,,
6,3,"Thinking about your sideburns?
"
,,
6,3,"Yeah. No, no, no, no,
"
,,
6,3,"you're not a complete jackass.
"
,,
6,3,"Oh, hey, nice T-shirt.
"
,,
6,3,"""Phresh""
"
,,
6,3,"And it's spelled with a p-h.
"
,,
6,3,"Oh, that's fun,
"
,,
6,3,"'cause it's usually spelled with an ""f.""
"
,,
6,3,"Yeah.
"
,,
6,3,"Oh, you got a little tear
"
,,
6,3,"in your pants, there...
"
,,
6,3,"Ohp, that's on purpose, though, isn't it?
"
,,
6,3,"Yeah, you're a bad boy.
"
,,
6,3,"You're a bad boy.
"
,,
6,3,"Society wants your pants to be intact,
"
,,
6,3,"but you're just not
"
,,
6,3,"gonna listen, are you?
"
,,
6,3,"My God, this is ridiculous.
"
,,
6,3,"I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to kill you.
"
,,
6,3,"All right, one more pre-party drink,
"
,,
6,3,"and then we'll head off to the Clam.
"
,,
6,3,"It's cheaper to drink
"
,,
6,3,"at your house first.
"
,,
6,3,"Boy, they sure are making
"
,,
6,3,"a lot of noise out there.
"
,,
6,3,"Those idiots have done nothing
"
,,
6,3,"but hang out
"
,,
6,3,"in that stupid shed
"
,,
6,3,"for the last two days.
"
,,
6,3,"We should crash that party.
"
,,
6,3,"Hey, you know what, Bernice is right.
"
,,
6,3,"They're always trying
"
,,
6,3,"to get away from us.
"
,,
6,3,"We should march in there
"
,,
6,3,"and remind them that they have wives.
"
,,
6,3,"Especially if they have food,
"
,,
6,3,"because bar food is so overpriced.
"
,,
6,3,"Man, who invited Anne Frank?
"
,,
6,3,"Quagmire, tell that story about
"
,,
6,3,"the girl with the inside-out anus.
"
,,
6,3," Oh, you mean Blossom?
"
,,
6,3," Oh, that's a great story.
"
,,
6,3,"All right, so I'm skulking around
"
,,
6,3,"the intensive care unit,
"
,,
6,3,"and all of sudden
"
,,
6,3,"this smoking hot chick...
"
,,
6,3,"Hey, boys!
"
,,
6,3,"Mind if we join the party?
"
,,
6,3,"Sorry, Lois, no girls allowed.
"
,,
6,3,"Oh, come on, Peter. It'd be
"
,,
6,3,"good to have some chicks in here.
"
,,
6,3,"Quagmire, you nuts?
"
,,
6,3,"This is a men's club.
"
,,
6,3,"That's the problem. The ratio be
"
,,
6,3,"terrible. It's a total mast-fest in here.
"
,,
6,3,"Yeah, this is sort of lame.
"
,,
6,3,"Well, we can fix that.
"
,,
6,3,"Come on, girls, let's dance!
"
,,
6,3,"Hey, hey, hey, stop it!
"
,,
6,3,"You women can't dance in here!
"
,,
6,3,"Well, I know two people
"
,,
6,3,"who'll take my side on this.
"
,,
6,3,"The stuffy parents from Dirty Dancing.
"
,,
6,3,"Right, guys?
"
,,
6,3,"Sorry, Peter.
"
,,
6,3,"Even we're getting into it.
"
,,
6,3,"What's the matter, Bonnie
"
,,
6,3,"don't you want to dance?
"
,,
6,3,"Oh, it's okay, Joe.
"
,,
6,3,"I don't mind sitting here with you.
"
,,
6,3,"What I mean is...
"
,,
6,3,"I don't want to hold you back.
"
,,
6,3,"Don't be silly, honey. It's just as
"
,,
6,3,"nice watching other people have fun.
"
,,
6,3,"God, I hate being handicapped.
"
,,
6,3,"Sometimes I feel more useless
"
,,
6,3,"than the head of the Maid's Union.
"
,,
6,3,"And what exactly are your demands?
"
,,
6,3,"We need more Lemon Pledge.
"
,,
6,3,"You need more Lemon Pledge?
"
,,
6,3,"Yes.
"
,,
6,3,"We're not responsible for that.
"
,,
6,3,"You should just bring it
"
,,
6,3,"from your own home.
"
,,
6,3,"No.
"
,,
6,3,"Hello.
"
,,
6,3,"Oh, hi, Lois.
"
,,
6,3,"Yeah, last night was fun.
"
,,
6,3,"Oh, it's okay,
"
,,
6,3,"I'm used to not dancing.
"
,,
6,3,"I mean, I knew what to expect after,
"
,,
6,3,"you know, Joe's accident,
"
,,
6,3,"and I'm prepared to live
"
,,
6,3,"the rest of my life this way.
"
,,
6,3,"Poor Bonnie.
"
,,
6,3,"She deserves so much better than me.
"
,,
6,3,"God, she must regret this marriage.
"
,,
6,3,"If only there was some way
"
,,
6,3,"for me to walk again.
"
,,
6,3,"Wait a minute, what am I saying?
"
,,
6,3,"There's nothing wrong with me.
"
,,
6,3,"I'm no different than any other guy!
"
,,
6,3,"Joe, would you put on your hand-shoes
"
,,
6,3,"and take out the garbage?
"
,,
6,3,"Thank you.
"
,,
6,3,"Hey, thanks for coming with me, Peter.
"
,,
6,3,"It sure would be wonderful
"
,,
6,3,"if Dr. Hartman could help me walk again.
"
,,
6,3,"I'm sorry, Mayor McCheese,
"
,,
6,3,"but I'm not sure if any
"
,,
6,3,"cosmetic surgery is even possible.
"
,,
6,3,"Look, if it's a financial issue,
"
,,
6,3,"It's not an issue of money,
"
,,
6,3,"your head is a cheeseburger.
"
,,
6,3,"There's no blood flow to it.
"
,,
6,3,"It's just, it's just dead cow meat.
"
,,
6,3,"All right, well, I appreciate
"
,,
6,3,"you giving it to me straight.
"
,,
6,3,"All right, then, have a tasty afternoon.
"
,,
6,3,"Ah, there's a smile.
"
,,
6,3,"So, what can I do for you, Mr. Swanson?
"
,,
6,3,"Doc, I can't take it anymore.
"
,,
6,3,"I want to walk again.
"
,,
6,3,"I'll do what ever it takes.
"
,,
6,3,"Well, there is a
"
,,
6,3,"highly experimental new procedure.
"
,,
6,3,"It's essentially a leg transplant.
"
,,
6,3,"If you'd be willing to sign a waiver,
"
,,
6,3,"I think I may be able to help you.
"
,,
6,3,"You know, when you talk,
"
,,
6,3,"you sound, a lot like my father-in-law,
"
,,
6,3,"Carter Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
6,3,"Oh, that's funny.
"
,,
6,3,"He's a patient of mine.
"
,,
6,3," Here's my urine sample, Doctor.
"
,,
6,3," Thank you, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
6,3,"Oh, hi, Peter.
"
,,
6,3,"You know, Peter says we sound alike.
"
,,
6,3," Really? I don't hear it.
"
,,
6,3," Actually, I think I do hear it now.
"
,,
6,3," Really?
"
,,
6,3," Yeah,
"
,,
6,3,"you know, we've never really had
"
,,
6,3,"any extended interactions,
"
,,
6,3,"so I've never noticed it.
"
,,
6,3," Hey, I think I hear it, too.
"
,,
6,3," Seems lazy, doesn't it?
"
,,
6,3,"Well, there's only so
"
,,
6,3,"many voices in the world.
"
,,
6,3,"Some of them are bound to be similar.
"
,,
6,3,"Now, Mr. Swanson,
"
,,
6,3,"through the magic of digital imaging,
"
,,
6,3,"we'll select the legs most suited to your
"
,,
6,3,"body from our inventory of donors.
"
,,
6,3,"Hey, what about these?
"
,,
6,3,"Ah, good choice. These are the only ones
"
,,
6,3,"we have in stock that aren't hilarious.
"
,,
6,3,"I'll take 'em!
"
,,
6,3,"Ah, Joe. You are gonna be happier than
"
,,
6,3,"bullfrogs on vacation in Ethiopia.
"
,,
6,3,"Ah, this is fantastic! This is even better
"
,,
6,3,"than they said it was in the brochure!
"
,,
6,3,"Oh, I feel like a pig,
"
,,
6,3,"but, come on, we're on vacation!
"
,,
6,3,"Exactly, don't hate yourself,
"
,,
6,3,"we're on vacation!
"
,,
6,3,"Yeah, I hear Madonna
"
,,
6,3,"is raising this guy's kid.
"
,,
6,3,"Now, just relax, Mr. Swanson,
"
,,
6,3,"and let the anesthetic do its job.
"
,,
6,3," All right, Doc, I trust you.
"
,,
6,3," Good.
"
,,
6,3,"Now, I'll just pop in the how-to video,
"
,,
6,3," and we'll get started.
"
,,
6,3," What?!
"
,,
6,3,"to perform leg surgery.</i>
"
,,
6,3,"No!
"
,,
6,3,"He's been in there an awful long time.
"
,,
6,3,"I hope everything's all right.
"
,,
6,3,"Gentlemen, I give you...
"
,,
6,3,"the new Joe Swanson.
"
,,
6,3,"Well, what do you think?
"
,,
6,3," Oh, honey!
"
,,
6,3," Oh, my God, you look great, Joe!
"
,,
6,3,"They still got that new leg smell.
"
,,
6,3,"I put his old legs in a bag
"
,,
6,3,"if you want them.
"
,,
6,3,"Oh, great. We'll take them home,
"
,,
6,3,"we'll give them to Brian.
"
,,
6,3,"Come on, Joe, I'll drive you home.
"
,,
6,3,"Are you kidding?
"
,,
6,3,"I've got working legs for the first time
"
,,
6,3,"in 15 years, and I'm gonna use them.
"
,,
6,3,"I'm walking home!
"
,,
6,3,"I'm sorry, Mr. Swanson. Hospital rules,
"
,,
6,3,"you have to leave in a wheelchair
"
,,
6,3,"Oh, Joe, that was amazing!
"
,,
6,3,"I know.
"
,,
6,3,"I was there.
"
,,
6,3,"My God, we haven't done it in so long,
"
,,
6,3,"I had forgotten how big you were.
"
,,
6,3,"I was gonna say the same thing to you.
"
,,
6,3,"a new reality show.</i>
"
,,
6,3,"From Life Goes On?</i>
"
,,
6,3,"You won't believe what happens!
"
,,
6,3,"Come on, guys, let's go!
"
,,
6,3,"Go? Where we going?
"
,,
6,3,"Listen, these new legs
"
,,
6,3,"have given me my life back.
"
,,
6,3,"I want to do all the things I could
"
,,
6,3,"never do when I was handicapped.
"
,,
6,3,"And you guys are my best friends.
"
,,
6,3,"I want you to experience it all with me.
"
,,
6,3,"You can count on us, Joe.
"
,,
6,3,"Oh, this is great! I feel so alive!
"
,,
6,3,"Come on, ladies!
"
,,
6,3,"Kick your high heels off and get moving!
"
,,
6,3,"You guys are a disgrace!
"
,,
6,3," Peter, this doesn't seem safe.
"
,,
6,3," Yeah, I'm afraid I might...
"
,,
6,3,"Wow. Thanks, Spider-Man.
"
,,
6,3,"Everybody gets one.
"
,,
6,3,"Tell him, Peter.
"
,,
6,3,"Uh, apparently, everybody gets one.
"
,,
6,3,"Bingo.
"
,,
6,3," I don't know about this, Joe.
"
,,
6,3," There is no fear in this dojo!
"
,,
6,3,"Joe, we don't even know what a dojo is.
"
,,
6,3,"There is no mercy in this dojo!
"
,,
6,3,"Joe, why don't you take it down a notch?
"
,,
6,3,"No mercy!
"
,,
6,3,"All right, we're gonna do it once more.
"
,,
6,3,"And this time, no mistakes!
"
,,
6,3,"The stars were shining bright</i>
"
,,
6,3,"It's too late to say good night</i>
"
,,
6,3," Good mornin'!</i>
"
,,
6,3,"Louisiana In the mornin', in the morn...</i>
"
,,
6,3,"Oh, I'm sorry.
"
,,
6,3,"I thought we were still going.
"
,,
6,3,"My God, Joe is running us ragged.
"
,,
6,3,"Yeah, I haven't been this exhausted
"
,,
6,3,"since I had that job
"
,,
6,3,"as Jackee Harry's personal
"
,,
6,3,"grocery shopper.
"
,,
6,3,"A pallet?
"
,,
6,3,"Am I reading this right? You need
"
,,
6,3,"a pallet of chocolate-covered pretzels?
"
,,
6,3,"Where the hell am I supposed to...?
"
,,
6,3,"And what is this,
"
,,
6,3,"a drum of grape jam?
"
,,
6,3,"What is that? Is that like
"
,,
6,3,"a drum like they ship oil in?
"
,,
6,3,"And look at this one :
"
,,
6,3,"""A desk of Cheez-Its.""
"
,,
6,3,"A desk? Where are you getting
"
,,
6,3,"these units of measurement from?
"
,,
6,3,"Mary.
"
,,
6,3,"That is still funny.
"
,,
6,3,"Okay, you stay right here, big
"
,,
6,3,"funny gal. I'll be right back with...
"
,,
6,3,"a ""hammock of cake.""
"
,,
6,3,"Yeah, Dave Matthews Live.
"
,,
6,3,"I'll burn you a copy.
"
,,
6,3," Stay cool.
"
,,
6,3," Hey, Joe. What you got there?
"
,,
6,3,"Mountain bike.
"
,,
6,3,"Oh, Joe, I don't know.
"
,,
6,3,"I'm still chafed from that power walk.
"
,,
6,3,"Both of my inner thighs look
"
,,
6,3,"like those big cherry Swedish Fish.
"
,,
6,3,"Don't worry.
"
,,
6,3,"I'm not taking you pansies
"
,,
6,3,"I'm taking my new friends.
"
,,
6,3,"This is Parker, Quentin and Portland.
"
,,
6,3," Is Portland the black one?
"
,,
6,3," Portland is the black one.
"
,,
6,3,"Joe, what the...
"
,,
6,3,"What the hell is this?
"
,,
6,3,"Well, Peter, I realized over
"
,,
6,3,"the last few days,
"
,,
6,3,"the only reason I hung out with you guys
"
,,
6,3,"is that I was crippled
"
,,
6,3,"and you were lazy.
"
,,
6,3,"I decided it's time I got some friends
"
,,
6,3,"more suited to my status.
"
,,
6,3,"But, Joe, we've been friends for years.
"
,,
6,3,"Hey, we all make mistakes.
"
,,
6,3,"Come on, dudes, let's go exercise.
"
,,
6,3," Exercise!
"
,,
6,3," Yeah!
"
,,
6,3,"I'm gonna do sit-up still I poop myself!
"
,,
6,3,"I can believe it.
"
,,
6,3,"Joe just dumped us. He's gone.
"
,,
6,3,"And all we got to remember him
"
,,
6,3,"by are his old legs.
"
,,
6,3,"Okay, okay.
"
,,
6,3,"Peter, I wish you'd go over there
"
,,
6,3,"and patch things up with Joe.
"
,,
6,3,"Hey, screw him, Lois.
"
,,
6,3,"He doesn't need us anymore now
"
,,
6,3,"that he's got his cool, new friends.
"
,,
6,3,"I tell you, those legs have turned him
"
,,
6,3,"into a complete jerk.
"
,,
6,3,"It's like giving a monkey
"
,,
6,3,"the keys to an amusement park.
"
,,
6,3," How is that?
"
,,
6,3," How is what?
"
,,
6,3,"How is it anything like a monkey
"
,,
6,3,"having the keys to an amusement park?
"
,,
6,3,"I don't know.
"
,,
6,3,"The hours would be erratic.
"
,,
6,3,"Maintenance would probably
"
,,
6,3,"suffer to some degree.
"
,,
6,3,"The prizes for games of chance
"
,,
6,3,"would all be bananas.
"
,,
6,3,"Lois, don't call me on this stuff,
"
,,
6,3,"all right?
"
,,
6,3,"I'm... Just go with it.
"
,,
6,3,"Support me in these moments.
"
,,
6,3,"I'm hurt. I lost my buddy.
"
,,
6,3,"Well, Peter, there have been
"
,,
6,3,"a lot of changes in Joe's life,
"
,,
6,3,"and maybe he just needed to move on.
"
,,
6,3,"If I were you, I'd look for
"
,,
6,3,"a new friend. A kindred spirit,
"
,,
6,3,"like Judas found in Pontius Pilate.
"
,,
6,3,"You know, sometimes
"
,,
6,3,"I feel like someone should just...
"
,,
6,3," Crucify Jesus of Nazareth. Oh, my God!
"
,,
6,3," Crucify Jesus of Nazareth. Oh, my God!
"
,,
6,3," Shut up!
"
,,
6,3," No, you shut up!
"
,,
6,3," I'm Judas.
"
,,
6,3," Pontius.
"
,,
6,3,"This is so weird, because just today,
"
,,
6,3,"I was thinking about
"
,,
6,3,"how I wanted to find the son of God
"
,,
6,3,"and nail him to some wood.
"
,,
6,3,"Well, let's go find him
"
,,
6,3,"and kick his ass!
"
,,
6,3,"That sounds swell!
"
,,
6,3,"The summer sun's calling my name...</i>
"
,,
6,3,"So, do you really think you're suited
"
,,
6,3,"to be the fourth guy
"
,,
6,3,"in our group, Buzz Killington?
"
,,
6,3,"Yeah, I mean, we mainly just sit here
"
,,
6,3,"in the booth and crack jokes, but
"
,,
6,3,"you're kind of a buzz kill.
"
,,
6,3,"Oh, on the contrary. I've quite
"
,,
6,3,"a mastery of the humorous yarn.
"
,,
6,3,"Do any of you know the tale
"
,,
6,3,"of how corn meal came to be
"
,,
6,3," No.
"
,,
6,3," No.
"
,,
6,3," No.
"
,,
6,3,"Neither did the miller
"
,,
6,3,"when he left his house that morning.
"
,,
6,3,"We got to get Joe back.
"
,,
6,3,"Joe, please, can't we talk about this?!
"
,,
6,3,"There's nothing to talk about.
"
,,
6,3,"I've out grown you, Bonnie.
"
,,
6,3,"I need to spread my legs and fly.
"
,,
6,3,"Keep the kid.
"
,,
6,3,"It was awful.
"
,,
6,3,"I mean, he just left Bonnie.
"
,,
6,3,"And then the bastard completely
"
,,
6,3,"blew me off
"
,,
6,3,"to hang out with those new douche bags.
"
,,
6,3,"Peter, we got to do something.
"
,,
6,3,"You're right, Cleveland.
"
,,
6,3,"Boys, there's only one answer.
"
,,
6,3,"We got to re-cripple Joe.
"
,,
6,3,"It's the right thing to do,
"
,,
6,3,"like taking out Hitler.
"
,,
6,3,"See? We had a plan for that all along.
"
,,
6,3,"Bye, new awesome friends!
"
,,
6,3,"Bonnie, I forgot my Soloflex.
"
,,
6,3," Yo, Joe.
"
,,
6,3," What the hell you doing here, pansy?
"
,,
6,3,"We're gonna break your legs, Joe.
"
,,
6,3,"It's for your own good.
"
,,
6,3,"Come on, guys, get him!
"
,,
6,3,"All right, then.
"
,,
6,3,"Bonnie! What the hell?!
"
,,
6,3,"Put my gun down!
"
,,
6,3,"Not until I have my husband back!
"
,,
6,3," Aah! My perfect ass!
"
,,
6,3," Oh, I'm sorry, Joe.
"
,,
6,3,"I was aiming for your spine.
"
,,
6,3," Aah! Damn it!
"
,,
6,3," Joe, I'm so sorry.
"
,,
6,3,"I'm a terrible shot.
"
,,
6,3,"Oh, for God's sakes,
"
,,
6,3,"just give me the gun!
"
,,
6,3,"I'll do it myself!
"
,,
6,3,"Boy, we, uh, really did
"
,,
6,3,"a number on each other.
"
,,
6,3,"You know, I just want to take this
"
,,
6,3,"opportunity to apologize to you guys.
"
,,
6,3,"I was acting like a first-class jackass.
"
,,
6,3,"I... hope that you can forgive me.
"
,,
6,3,"Oh, it's just good
"
,,
6,3,"to have our old Joe back.
"
,,
6,3,"And once our injuries heal up,
"
,,
6,3,"we can all go for a nice, long walk.
"
,,
6,3,"All right!
"
,,
6,3,"Yeah!
"
,,
6,3,"Wait a minute!
"
,,
6,3,"Joke's on you.

"
,,
6,4," Oh, thank you, everybody.
"
,,
6,4,"I know it's a little self-centered,
"
,,
6,4,"but this is my favorite day of the year.
"
,,
6,4,"Here, Mom, this is from me and Meg.
"
,,
6,4,"Topol? The smoker's tooth polish?
"
,,
6,4,"Take the hint.
"
,,
6,4,"Happy Birthday, sweetheart.
"
,,
6,4,"Lionel Ritchie's ""Can't Slow Down""?
"
,,
6,4,"Great album, Lois. Great album.
"
,,
6,4,"I didn't know who I was
"
,,
6,4,"until I heard this album.
"
,,
6,4,"Oh, God, Lionel.
"
,,
6,4,"You have been hurt.
"
,,
6,4,"You have been hurt by somebody,
"
,,
6,4,"that much is clear.
"
,,
6,4,"Who hurt you?
"
,,
6,4,"Who hurt you? Who hurt you?
"
,,
6,4,"Who hurt you? Who hurt you?
"
,,
6,4,"Oh, thank you all so much.
"
,,
6,4,"What thoughtful gifts.
"
,,
6,4,"Uh, Lois, there's one more.
"
,,
6,4,"Oh, Brian, you don't have
"
,,
6,4,"to give me anything.
"
,,
6,4,"Well, give it back then.
"
,,
6,4,"No, no, we have fun.
"
,,
6,4,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
6,4,"Two tickets for a cruise?
"
,,
6,4,"Brian, this is wonderful.
"
,,
6,4," What the hell?
"
,,
6,4," Brian!
"
,,
6,4," You fink!
"
,,
6,4,"Hey, hey, hey, hey. What is this?
"
,,
6,4,"We agreed on a $20 limit.
"
,,
6,4,"We set a cap, you jerk.
"
,,
6,4,"Are you trying to make us look bad,
"
,,
6,4,"you son of a bitch?
"
,,
6,4,"Peter, what are you angry about?
"
,,
6,4,"You get to go on a cruise with me.
"
,,
6,4," What?
"
,,
6,4," What?
"
,,
6,4,"Well, yeah, you didn't think Brian
"
,,
6,4,"meant for me to go with him, did you?
"
,,
6,4,"Great. This was a bigger waste of time
"
,,
6,4,"than Ringo's song-writing.
"
,,
6,4,"Hey, guys. I wrote a song.
"
,,
6,4,"Oh, that's great.
"
,,
6,4," Oh, good, Ringo.
"
,,
6,4," Fantastic.
"
,,
6,4,"You know what?
"
,,
6,4,"I'm gonna put it... right here.
"
,,
6,4,"Right on the refrigerator.
"
,,
6,4,"That way we'll get to see it everyday.
"
,,
6,4,"All right.
"
,,
6,4,"Now, you kids behave yourselves
"
,,
6,4,"while we're away.
"
,,
6,4,"Yeah, be good till we get back,
"
,,
6,4,"and Brian, stay out of the cat box!
"
,,
6,4,"Stay out of the cat box!
"
,,
6,4," Bye, you guys!
"
,,
6,4," Bye, Mom!
"
,,
6,4,"Bye, Dad!
"
,,
6,4,"Farewell, Brian, I'm off to sea.
"
,,
6,4,"An hour from now,
"
,,
6,4,"I'll be surrounded by seamen.
"
,,
6,4,"Sperm whales and seamen.
"
,,
6,4,"Ooh, a swallow.
"
,,
6,4,"Stewie, Peter and Lois
"
,,
6,4,"aren't taking you with them.
"
,,
6,4,"They've already boarded.
"
,,
6,4,"Bye! Bye!
"
,,
6,4,"Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye!
"
,,
6,4,"Bye! Bye!
"
,,
6,4,"No! No, you can't leave!
"
,,
6,4,"Not without me! I'm the baby!
"
,,
6,4,"Oh, I haven't been this disappointed
"
,,
6,4,"since I saw The Lake House.
"
,,
6,4,"See, the mailbox is like a time portal.
"
,,
6,4,"Everything Keanu Reeves puts in there,
"
,,
6,4,"Sandra Bullock gets two years later.
"
,,
6,4,"Oh, my Hickory Farms package is here.
"
,,
6,4,"I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
"
,,
6,4,"I'm gonna have to bar you
"
,,
6,4,"from the aft section of the ship
"
,,
6,4,"for the rest of the cruise.
"
,,
6,4,"We are so sorry.
"
,,
6,4,"Peter, what the hell did you think
"
,,
6,4,"you were doing?
"
,,
6,4,"Lois, it is called the ""Poop Deck.""
"
,,
6,4,"That is why I pooped there.
"
,,
6,4," You're disgusting.
"
,,
6,4," And you're misleading.
"
,,
6,4,"Boy, this is romantic, isn't it, Lois?
"
,,
6,4,"Oh, it sure is, sweetie.
"
,,
6,4,"Uh, I feel like that
"
,,
6,4,"fat-ass British girl from Titanic.
"
,,
6,4,"What girl?
"
,,
6,4,"The lead in Titanic,
"
,,
6,4,"the one opposite Leonardo DiCaprio.
"
,,
6,4," Sweetheart, that was a guy.
"
,,
6,4," What?
"
,,
6,4,"That was a guy.
"
,,
6,4,"That was Philip Seymour Hoffman.
"
,,
6,4,"What? No, it wasn't.
"
,,
6,4,"Yes, it was, honey.
"
,,
6,4,"It was Philip Seymour Hoffman.
"
,,
6,4,"Look at you out here on a big trip.
"
,,
6,4,"What are you doing?
"
,,
6,4,"I'll teach that hussy
"
,,
6,4,"to go on a boat ride without me.
"
,,
6,4,"When she returns,
"
,,
6,4,"I'm going to put bamboo splinters
"
,,
6,4,"under all her fingernails.
"
,,
6,4,"Then I'm gonna strip her down
"
,,
6,4,"and tie her to the bed.
"
,,
6,4,"Okay.
"
,,
6,4,"Then I'm gonna make her crawl
"
,,
6,4,"on her hands and knees
"
,,
6,4,"while I drip hot candle wax
"
,,
6,4,"all over her back.
"
,,
6,4,"Uh, and then what are you gonna do?
"
,,
6,4,"Uh, let's see...
"
,,
6,4,"Are you gonna shower her off
"
,,
6,4,"after all that candle wax?
"
,,
6,4,"No, I'm gonna keep her filthy.
"
,,
6,4,"Yeah, she's been a bad girl.
"
,,
6,4,"And then I'm gonna gag her
"
,,
6,4,"with her own brassiere.
"
,,
6,4," What?
"
,,
6,4," No, no, nothing, nothing.
"
,,
6,4,"That's all part of
"
,,
6,4,"your diabolical plan to...
"
,,
6,4," humiliate her.
"
,,
6,4," Yes, yes, she'll be humiliated.
"
,,
6,4,"Maybe you'll handcuff her?
"
,,
6,4,"She'll hate that.
"
,,
6,4," Then I shall do that as well!
"
,,
6,4," And call her a bitch.
"
,,
6,4,"Until I'm hoarse with rage!
"
,,
6,4,"Maybe smack her ass with a riding crop?
"
,,
6,4,"Yes, and then... What?
"
,,
6,4,"No, I mean, that-that would like, 
"
,,
6,4,"that, that would show her.
"
,,
6,4,"Are you...?
"
,,
6,4,"You're getting some kind of
"
,,
6,4,"sick sexual thrill off this, aren't you?
"
,,
6,4,"Who cares?
"
,,
6,4,"You're not gonna kill her anyway.
"
,,
6,4,"You're gonna bitch and moan, and then
"
,,
6,4,"you're gonna do what you always do :
"
,,
6,4,"the minute Lois walks through that door,
"
,,
6,4,"you're gonna forget all about it,
"
,,
6,4,"beg for your apple juice,
"
,,
6,4,"go poop and fall asleep.
"
,,
6,4,"God, he's right.
"
,,
6,4,"I've got the same daily routine
"
,,
6,4,"as Dick Clark.
"
,,
6,4,"Rupert, I've been all talk.
"
,,
6,4,"So much time wasted.
"
,,
6,4,"Well, no longer.
"
,,
6,4,"Lois is a dead woman!
"
,,
6,4,"I'll do to her what douche bags
"
,,
6,4,"did to the guitar.
"
,,
6,4,"This is a song I wrote last summer.
"
,,
6,4,"It's called :
"
,,
6,4,"""Water"".
"
,,
6,4,"Peter, stop picking your teeth.
"
,,
6,4,"We're at the Captain's table.
"
,,
6,4,"And that was the first time
"
,,
6,4,"I saw the Northern Lights at their peak.
"
,,
6,4,"And as I gazed,
"
,,
6,4,"astonished,
"
,,
6,4,"at their lustrous brilliance,
"
,,
6,4,"I turned to my first mate and I said,
"
,,
6,4,"""We are looking
"
,,
6,4,"into the very eyes of God.""
"
,,
6,4,"Oh, what a wonderful story.
"
,,
6,4,"All right, I got one for ya.
"
,,
6,4,"So me and Lois are driving up
"
,,
6,4,"to Vermont to get this abortion...
"
,,
6,4," Peter!
"
,,
6,4," Hang on, hang on, Lois. Don't ruin it.
"
,,
6,4,"All right, so we're driving up
"
,,
6,4,"to get this abortion
"
,,
6,4,"and we get to the abortion clinic
"
,,
6,4,"and the abortionist has one hand.
"
,,
6,4," Peter, for god's...
"
,,
6,4," Bah-bah. I'll tell it, I'll tell it.
"
,,
6,4,"So I turn to Lois and I says,
"
,,
6,4,"""You want to get an abortion here?""
"
,,
6,4,"""You want to get an abortion with
"
,,
6,4,"the abortionist having a stump hand?""
"
,,
6,4,"""We can't get an abortion here.""
"
,,
6,4,"So, we turned around and went home
"
,,
6,4,"and two-and-a-half months later
"
,,
6,4,"our daughter Meg was born.
"
,,
6,4,"Okay, explain to me exactly
"
,,
6,4,"what I did wrong.
"
,,
6,4,"Peter, that story was
"
,,
6,4,"completely inappropriate!
"
,,
6,4,"Well, send me the crap to hell
"
,,
6,4,"for being nostalgic
"
,,
6,4,"about the early years of our marriage.
"
,,
6,4,"You've totally ruined this trip for me!
"
,,
6,4,"I am mortified to even show
"
,,
6,4,"my face around this ship!
"
,,
6,4,"Hey, the captain's the one who should
"
,,
6,4,"be embarrassed. His story was gay.
"
,,
6,4,"You're gay!
"
,,
6,4,"Hello, Mother.
"
,,
6,4,"Stewie?
"
,,
6,4,"What the hell are you...
"
,,
6,4,"How did you get here?
"
,,
6,4,"Oh, there's a very simple
"
,,
6,4,"answer to that.
"
,,
6,4,"You drove me here, Lois.
"
,,
6,4,"With all the indignities
"
,,
6,4,"I've been forced to suffer
"
,,
6,4,"day in and day out
"
,,
6,4,"under your matriarchal tyranny.
"
,,
6,4,"What are you... wh...
"
,,
6,4,"what are you doing with a gun?
"
,,
6,4,"Something I should've done
"
,,
6,4,"a very long time ago.
"
,,
6,4,"I did it! I killed her!
"
,,
6,4,"She's dead!
"
,,
6,4,"Mommy! Mommy!
"
,,
6,4,"Mommy!
"
,,
6,4,"Oh, yeah, that's right.
"
,,
6,4,"And finally, still no word on
"
,,
6,4,"the disappearance of Lois Griffin,
"
,,
6,4,"housewife and mother from Quahog
"
,,
6,4,"who vanished from
"
,,
6,4,"a cruise ship six days ago.
"
,,
6,4,"Well folks, that's
"
,,
6,4,"the news, and
"
,,
6,4,"I...
"
,,
6,4,"am...
"
,,
6,4,"outta here!
"
,,
6,4,"Daddy, she's been missing so long.
"
,,
6,4,"Do you think they'll ever find her?
"
,,
6,4,"God, I hope so, Meg.
"
,,
6,4,"Oh, yes, I'm sure they'll find her.
"
,,
6,4,"Nobody suspects a thing.</i>
"
,,
6,4,"that sounds cool.</i>
"
,,
6,4,"Hi, Peter. Can I talk to you
"
,,
6,4,"in the kitchen for a second?
"
,,
6,4,"What is it, Joe?
"
,,
6,4,"Please tell me Lois is alive.
"
,,
6,4,"It's been six days, Peter. I'm sorry,
"
,,
6,4,"but we had to call off the search.
"
,,
6,4,"I'm afraid you're just going
"
,,
6,4,"to have to accept the fact that..
"
,,
6,4,"she's gone.
"
,,
6,4,"No!
"
,,
6,4,"He Wants His Family Back.""</i>
"
,,
6,4," I want my family back!
"
,,
6,4," Okay.
"
,,
6,4," Give me back my family!
"
,,
6,4," Get off me!
"
,,
6,4,"I want my family back!
"
,,
6,4," Hey, where've you been?
"
,,
6,4," Ah, I had another date.
"
,,
6,4,"You know, I'm glad you're finally
"
,,
6,4,"putting yourself out there.
"
,,
6,4,"Lois would've wanted you to move on.
"
,,
6,4,"Yeah, only this one was kind of awkward.
"
,,
6,4,"My date was a stick figure.
"
,,
6,4,"So...
"
,,
6,4,"how would this work...
"
,,
6,4,"in bed.
"
,,
6,4,"Well, I can't do sex.
"
,,
6,4,"But I can give you a stick job.
"
,,
6,4,"That a... that sounds...
"
,,
6,4,"Yes, it is very unpleasant.
"
,,
6,4,"But the freakiest was that date
"
,,
6,4,"I had with Bonnie.
"
,,
6,4,"Peter...
"
,,
6,4,"you don't know how badly I need this.
"
,,
6,4,"I don't know, Bonnie,
"
,,
6,4,"it's, it's just a little weird.
"
,,
6,4," Joe's a friend of mine.
"
,,
6,4," No, it's okay.
"
,,
6,4," I promise you it's okay.
"
,,
6,4," Eh, I'm not sure.
"
,,
6,4,"It's okay, Peter.
"
,,
6,4,"Just remember, whatever you do,
"
,,
6,4,"don't tell Chris I'm dating.
"
,,
6,4,"Peter, Lois has been dead
"
,,
6,4,"for a whole year.
"
,,
6,4,"You're gonna have to tell him sometime.
"
,,
6,4,"Hi, Dad.
"
,,
6,4,"Did we get any mail
"
,,
6,4,"from Mom at the health spa today?
"
,,
6,4,"Nope, sorry, Chris.
"
,,
6,4,"She said she's going straight
"
,,
6,4,"from the spa right back to Europe.
"
,,
6,4,"But I haven't seen Mom since
"
,,
6,4,"she took me back-to-school shopping.
"
,,
6,4,"All right, sweetie,
"
,,
6,4,"you ready to get some new notebooks
"
,,
6,4,"and protractors and slacks?
"
,,
6,4," I want blue jeans.
"
,,
6,4," You're getting slacks!
"
,,
6,4,"Here you go, Stewie.
"
,,
6,4,"Finish your oatmeal, and then I'll get
"
,,
6,4,"you ready for our ""Mommy and Me"" class.
"
,,
6,4,"You know, Meg has really flourished
"
,,
6,4,"since Lois was murdered.
"
,,
6,4,"What are you talking about?
"
,,
6,4,"Lois's death was an accident.
"
,,
6,4,"Which is just what someone
"
,,
6,4,"who pulled off the perfect murder
"
,,
6,4,"would want you to think.
"
,,
6,4,"What the hell are you...?
"
,,
6,4,"Stewie,
"
,,
6,4,"did you...
"
,,
6,4," Did you kill Lois?
"
,,
6,4," Of course I didn't, Brian.
"
,,
6,4,"Remember what you said?
"
,,
6,4,"I'm all talk.
"
,,
6,4,"I wouldn't possibly go through with it.
"
,,
6,4,"I'll just poop and fall asleep.
"
,,
6,4,"My God,
"
,,
6,4,"you did it.
"
,,
6,4,"You actually did it.
"
,,
6,4,"Oh God,
"
,,
6,4,"I've really screwed myself up here.
"
,,
6,4,"Could you reachin to my pocket and
"
,,
6,4,"get the number for that acupuncturist?
"
,,
6,4,"You son of a bitch, you killed Lois.
"
,,
6,4,"Good luck proving that, Brian.
"
,,
6,4,"Seriously, that number?
"
,,
6,4,"Well, I'm going to expose you
"
,,
6,4,"for what you are.
"
,,
6,4,"No matter what it takes,
"
,,
6,4,"you are going to pay for this.
"
,,
6,4,"You know, it's funny, from this
"
,,
6,4,"position, I can hear Meg upstairs.
"
,,
6,4,"I'm going to pretend
"
,,
6,4,"you're the New York Knicks.
"
,,
6,4,"Hey, put your wallets away, guys.
"
,,
6,4,"The drinks are on me.
"
,,
6,4,"Well, that's awful nice, Peter.
"
,,
6,4,"What's the occasion?
"
,,
6,4,"Lois' life insurance policy paid off.
"
,,
6,4,"I got more money than Barbara Streisand.
"
,,
6,4,"Honey, I'm going shopping.
"
,,
6,4,"And I was going to valet park.
"
,,
6,4,"I didn't know that you
"
,,
6,4,"had life insurance on Lois.
"
,,
6,4,"Did you get that
"
,,
6,4,"right before the cruise?
"
,,
6,4,"Actually, I got it on the cruise.
"
,,
6,4,"Right after we had
"
,,
6,4,"that big fight when I said,
"
,,
6,4,"""I wish you were dead,""
"
,,
6,4,"right before I never saw her again.
"
,,
6,4,"Well, see you guys later.
"
,,
6,4,"I got to go buy hot dogs.
"
,,
6,4,"We keep running out for some reason.
"
,,
6,4,"Either of you guys think
"
,,
6,4,"it's a little suspicious
"
,,
6,4,"that Peter took out a
"
,,
6,4,"life insurance policy on Lois
"
,,
6,4,"right before she went missing?
"
,,
6,4,"You don't think...
"
,,
6,4,"That fat bastard murdered her,
"
,,
6,4,"didn't he?
"
,,
6,4,"That son of a bitch!
"
,,
6,4,"He's a killer, like Bernie Goetz!
"
,,
6,4,"You know, the subway vigilante
"
,,
6,4,"from the eighties?
"
,,
6,4,"I used to do a bit about him back
"
,,
6,4,"when I was doing standup.
"
,,
6,4,"Ah, what else is in the news?
"
,,
6,4,"Oh, oh, Bernie Goetz.
"
,,
6,4,"Did you hear about this?
"
,,
6,4,"This guy Bernie Goetz
"
,,
6,4,"shot a bunch of muggers on the subway.
"
,,
6,4,"Wouldn't mind having him with me
"
,,
6,4,"next time I go see my mother-in-law.
"
,,
6,4,"No, but really, New York City's
"
,,
6,4,"a great place to live...
"
,,
6,4,"if you're a cockroach.
"
,,
6,4," I know.
"
,,
6,4,"Hey, Stewie, I found this receipt for a
"
,,
6,4,"speedboat rental upstairs in your room.
"
,,
6,4,"It's dated about a year ago.
"
,,
6,4,"Any idea how it got there?
"
,,
6,4,"Um, someone who rented a
"
,,
6,4,"speedboat must have left it there.
"
,,
6,4,"Uh-huh.
"
,,
6,4,"Well, you can play innocent
"
,,
6,4,"all you want.
"
,,
6,4,"I am going to find the evidence
"
,,
6,4,"to put you away.
"
,,
6,4,"Starting by proving that
"
,,
6,4,"you were on that cruise ship
"
,,
6,4,"the night Lois disappeared.
"
,,
6,4,"No, I wasn't.
"
,,
6,4,"I was at the carnival with Rupert.
"
,,
6,4,"Ah, the carnival with Rupert.
"
,,
6,4,"We won! We won!
"
,,
6,4,"Do it again!
"
,,
6,4,"Now I want a pink one!
"
,,
6,4,"Stewie, we've been playing
"
,,
6,4,"for half an hour.
"
,,
6,4,"Oh, okay. You want to go ride
"
,,
6,4,"the tea bags... tea cups?
"
,,
6,4,"I was hoping to keep
"
,,
6,4,"these mementos, Rupert,
"
,,
6,4,"but I can't risk it with the dog
"
,,
6,4,"sniffing around for evidence.
"
,,
6,4,"Damn!
"
,,
6,4,"What the hell are they doing here?!
"
,,
6,4,"What are we looking for, Joe?
"
,,
6,4,"Well, the trail is pretty cold by now,
"
,,
6,4,"but if Peter did kill Lois,
"
,,
6,4,"we might find some clues in his garbage.
"
,,
6,4,"Man, I haven't dug through these cans
"
,,
6,4,"since Lois died.
"
,,
6,4,"Can't believe it's been 12 months
"
,,
6,4,"since I've deliberately choked myself
"
,,
6,4,"by stuffing her discarded makeup sponges
"
,,
6,4,"down my throat.
"
,,
6,4,"What's wrong with you?
"
,,
6,4,"Oh, my God.
"
,,
6,4,"That does look like Peter's handwriting.
"
,,
6,4,"There's no doubt anymore.
"
,,
6,4,"Peter murdered his wife.
"
,,
6,4,"This is fantastic!
"
,,
6,4,"I'm completely off the hook!
"
,,
6,4,"What the hell?
"
,,
6,4,"Hey, little man,
"
,,
6,4,"tell Chris to open his window.
"
,,
6,4,"there's a rainbow in the sky</i>
"
,,
6,4,"Joe, what the hell is going on?
"
,,
6,4,"You're a suspect in Lois' murder,
"
,,
6,4,"that's what's going on!
"
,,
6,4,"Don't make us go good cop,
"
,,
6,4,"developmentally disabled cop on you.
"
,,
6,4,"Um,
"
,,
6,4,"we know that,
"
,,
6,4,"um,
"
,,
6,4,"you, um, killed Lois.
"
,,
6,4,"Um,
"
,,
6,4,"hello?
"
,,
6,4,"Uh...
"
,,
6,4,"no.
"
,,
6,4,"We can, um,
"
,,
6,4,"put you at the, um,
"
,,
6,4,"scene where she, um, was,
"
,,
6,4,"um, killed.
"
,,
6,4,"Hobey's right, Peter.
"
,,
6,4,"It doesn't look good for you.
"
,,
6,4,"Joe, you got this all wrong!
"
,,
6,4,"Like God did when he made
"
,,
6,4,"Rosie O'Donnell.
"
,,
6,4,"You can't put a vagina on this man!
"
,,
6,4,"Why not? I'm God.
"
,,
6,4,"Well, what do you want to do
"
,,
6,4,"about the breasts?
"
,,
6,4,"Ah, take a couple out of the bin
"
,,
6,4,"we can't find matches for.
"
,,
6,4,"I can't believe Dad killed Mom.
"
,,
6,4,"Look, there he is!
"
,,
6,4,"Dad, how could you?!
"
,,
6,4,"Hey, Dad, if they put you in jail,
"
,,
6,4,"can we go in your room?
"
,,
6,4,"Look, don't you kids buy any of this
"
,,
6,4,"for a second. Your father is innocent.
"
,,
6,4,"Oh, he killed her.
"
,,
6,4,"Just like the telephone killed
"
,,
6,4,"the telegraph sex business.
"
,,
6,4,"Hey, baby. I bet you're hot. Stop.
"
,,
6,4,"Describe to me what you're doing
"
,,
6,4,"to yourself right now. Stop.
"
,,
6,4,"Oh, yeah.
"
,,
6,4,"Oh, yeah...
"
,,
6,4,"Oh, nasty!
"
,,
6,4,"This trial is called to order.
"
,,
6,4,"Defense Counsel, we will hear
"
,,
6,4,"your opening statement.
"
,,
6,4,"Hey, everybody,
"
,,
6,4,"today's the big day.
"
,,
6,4,"That's all, Your Honor.
"
,,
6,4,"Good. Good.
"
,,
6,4,"Prosecutor, call your first witness.
"
,,
6,4,"Peter called me right after
"
,,
6,4,"he killed my daughter
"
,,
6,4," to tell me he killed my daughter.
"
,,
6,4," Really?
"
,,
6,4,"Well, that is interesting.
"
,,
6,4,"Yes, and as a favor to the court,
"
,,
6,4,"I've produced this simulation
"
,,
6,4,"of how the killing transpired.
"
,,
6,4,"I play Peter, and I hired an
"
,,
6,4,"Asian hooker to play my daughter.
"
,,
6,4,"Lois, I'm fat and I'm stupid,
"
,,
6,4,"and I fart at times that ruin
"
,,
6,4,"my father-in-law's social occasions,
"
,,
6,4,"and that's why
"
,,
6,4,"I'm never invited to them.
"
,,
6,4,"You pay me now?
"
,,
6,4,"Chris,
"
,,
6,4,"have you ever seen your father
"
,,
6,4,"do anything bad?
"
,,
6,4,"Well, now that you mention it...
"
,,
6,4,"Hey, Meg.
"
,,
6,4,"Proud of you!
"
,,
6,4,"Mr. Griffin, do you deny
"
,,
6,4,"killing your wife?
"
,,
6,4,"Of course I deny it.
"
,,
6,4,"I loved my wife.
"
,,
6,4,"And I certainly think
"
,,
6,4,"I'd remember killing her.
"
,,
6,4,"Mr. Griffin,
"
,,
6,4,"do you drink?
"
,,
6,4,"I plead the fifth of Jack.
"
,,
6,4,"No, no, I'm joking.
"
,,
6,4,"Yes, I drink.
"
,,
6,4,"And have you ever struck your wife?
"
,,
6,4,"Only in front of the kids to assert my
"
,,
6,4,"status as dominant male of the pride
"
,,
6,4,"Are you a violent man?
"
,,
6,4,"What are you, a wise guy?
"
,,
6,4,"'Cause I know how to deal
"
,,
6,4,"with wise guys.
"
,,
6,4," No further questions.
"
,,
6,4," You son of a bitch.
"
,,
6,4,"If I had a gun on a boat, I'd shoot you.
"
,,
6,4,"Mr. Foreman, how say you?
"
,,
6,4,"We find Peter Griffin guilty of murder
"
,,
6,4,"in the first degree.
"
,,
6,4," Oh, no!
"
,,
6,4," Oh, no!
"
,,
6,4," Oh, no!
"
,,
6,4," Oh, no!
"
,,
6,4," Oh, no!
"
,,
6,4," Oh, yeah!
"
,,
6,4,"Okay, can I ask everyone to please
"
,,
6,4,"stop saying, ""Oh, no"" in this courtroom?
"
,,
6,4,"'Cause the ******* Kool-Aid Guy's
"
,,
6,4,"gonna keep showing up.
"
,,
6,4,"Thank you.
"
,,
6,4,"Mr. Griffin,
"
,,
6,4,"I hereby sentence you to life
"
,,
6,4,"imprisonment with no possibility of...
"
,,
6,4,"Lois!
"
,,
6,4,"You're alive!
"
,,
6,4," Mom, you're alive!
"
,,
6,4," Oh, my gosh, Mom!
"
,,
6,4,"Lois, my God, what happened?
"
,,
6,4,"We thought you were dead!
"
,,
6,4,"Mom, we thought Dad killed you!
"
,,
6,4,"No, he didn't, Chris.
"
,,
6,4,"But someone tried to.
"
,,
6,4,"Do you remember who it was?
"
,,
6,4,"Yes, I do.
"
,,
6,4,"It was Stewie!

6,5,"recaping the events of the last episode

6,5,"of Family Guy.
"
,,
6,5,"What happened last time, Ollie?
"
,,
6,5,"Stewie killed Lois!
"
,,
6,5," Then what?
"
,,
6,5," Peter got blamed!
"
,,
6,5," Then what ?
"
,,
6,5," Peter went to court!
"
,,
6,5," Then what?
"
,,
6,5," Lois came back!
"
,,
6,5," How?
"
,,
6,5," She wasn't really dead!
"
,,
6,5,"Thanks, Ollie.

"
,,
6,5,"Oh, Lois, sweetheart,
"
,,
6,5,"I'm so glad you're alive!
"
,,
6,5,"You got to tell me
"
,,
6,5,"everything that happened.
"
,,
6,5,"I mean, not tonight 'cause I've got plans
"
,,
6,5,"with the guys,
"
,,
6,5,"but tomorrow night,
"
,,
6,5,"I want to hear all about it.
"
,,
6,5,"Peter, didn't you hear
"
,,
6,5,"what I said?
"
,,
6,5,"Stewie tried to kill me.
"
,,
6,5,"Mom, Stewie's just a baby.
"
,,
6,5,"No, he's not, Meg.
"
,,
6,5,"He's evil!
"
,,
6,5,"He shot me point-blank
"
,,
6,5,"right on the deck of the cruise ship.
"
,,
6,5,"been for a passing merman...</i>
"
,,
6,5,"and carried me to safety.</i>
"
,,
6,5,"It sounds romantic, I know,
"
,,
6,5," but unfortunately,
"
,,
6,5,"he was kind of a reverse of what
"
,,
6,5,"you'd expect a merman to be.
"
,,
6,5,"I wish to make love to you.
"
,,
6,5,"Oh, uh...
"
,,
6,5,"No, thank you.
"
,,
6,5,"What are you talking about?
"
,,
6,5,"I thought this was a woman's fantasy.
"
,,
6,5,"Yeah, but this is sort of the opposite.
"
,,
6,5,"Like if you had a man's body
"
,,
6,5,"and fish legs, then it'd be different.
"
,,
6,5,"Yeah, but then I wouldn't
"
,,
6,5,"have a penis.
"
,,
6,5," Well, but I...
"
,,
6,5," See? There you go. 
"
,,
6,5,"I just poked a huge hole in your logic.
"
,,
6,5,"I'm sorry. I'm just
"
,,
6,5,"gonna have to say no.
"
,,
6,5,"Maybe I feel like you
"
,,
6,5,"owe me a little.
"
,,
6,5,"Ah! Damn it!
"
,,
6,5,"total amnesia and had no idea who I was.</i>
"
,,
6,5,"I discovered I was in North Carolina</i>
"
,,
6,5,"at a summer camp for fat kids.</i>
"
,,
6,5,"from eating each other.</i>
"
,,
6,5,"Hey, hey!
"
,,
6,5,"No, no...!
"
,,
6,5,"Spit him out.
"
,,
6,5,"Jeffrey, spit him out now!
"
,,
6,5,"And Mike, you spit out Timmy.
"
,,
6,5,"I developed a relationship</i>
"
,,
6,5,"young townie named Derek.</i>
"
,,
6,5,"enough with me  to introduce me to his friends.</i>
"
,,
6,5,"he was a white supremacist.</i>
"
,,
6,5,"Okay, first order of business,
"
,,
6,5,"uh, I'd like to thank Paul and Tracy,
"
,,
6,5,"who have agreed to bring cookies
"
,,
6,5,"for next week's punch social.
"
,,
6,5,"Just remember, you two,
"
,,
6,5,"Fred is allergic to peanuts.
"
,,
6,5,"Peanuts and Jews!
"
,,
6,5,"No, but Jews are bad.
"
,,
6,5,"You know, it's remarks like that
"
,,
6,5,"that started the Holocaust.
"
,,
6,5,"And I know none of us
"
,,
6,5,"want that to happen again.
"
,,
6,5,"it all started coming back to me.</i>
"
,,
6,5,"So I rushed back to Quahog,
"
,,
6,5,"and here I am.
"
,,
6,5,"So what you're saying is we've got
"
,,
6,5,"a homicidal baby on our hands.
"
,,
6,5,"Mom, Dad!
"
,,
6,5,"Stewie's gone!
"
,,
6,5,"Don't worry, Lois.We'll catch him.
"
,,
6,5,"Sorry to bother you,
"
,,
6,5,"but we have a fugitive baby on our hands.
"
,,
6,5,"Have you seen this child?
"
,,
6,5,"No, I haven't,officer,
"
,,
6,5,"but I sure will keep my eyes open.
"
,,
6,5,"That killer baby
"
,,
6,5,"from the trial's gone missing.
"
,,
6,5," Oh, no!
"
,,
6,5," I know.
"
,,
6,5,"Mr. Superman no here.
"
,,
6,5," Well, we're lookingfor a missing...
"
,,
6,5," I, I, no.
"
,,
6,5,"Mr. Superman--he no is here.
"
,,
6,5,"Okay, well, uh, can you just give him this flyer?
"
,,
6,5,"I... No, no.
"
,,
6,5,"I have no money.
"
,,
6,5,"Just take this flyer and if you see this baby...
"
,,
6,5,"No, no.
"
,,
6,5,"Boy, I sure hopethey find him.
"
,,
6,5,"Otherwise, we're all gonna be...
"
,,
6,5,"So it's all out in the opennow, isn't it?
"
,,
6,5,"Stewie, uh, how long you been all messed up
"
,,
6,5,"and evil like this?
"
,,
6,5,"Oh, so now you're
"
,,
6,5,"interested in Stewie.
"
,,
6,5,"Last week when I made that macaroni picture of an owl,
"
,,
6,5,"you didn't give a damn!
"
,,
6,5,"That was an owl?
"
,,
6,5,"Yes, and now we're going to look at it again.
"
,,
6,5," Look, look,do you like it?!
"
,,
6,5," Yes.
"
,,
6,5,"What do you like about it specifically?!
"
,,
6,5,"I don't know.
"
,,
6,5,"Pick something or I'll blow your brains out!
"
,,
6,5,"I like... how it lookslike an owl.
"
,,
6,5,"Thank you for the compliment!
"
,,
6,5,"I heard shouting.</i>
"
,,
6,5,"Dog, answer it.
"
,,
6,5,"Tell him, ""Yes,everything's fine.""
"
,,
6,5,"Yes, Joe, everything's fine.
"
,,
6,5,"Oh, okay, good.
"
,,
6,5,"Make fun ofhis wheel chair.
"
,,
6,5,"What?
"
,,
6,5," What?
"
,,
6,5," Do it!
"
,,
6,5,"Say, ""Ha-ha-ha-ha,you're in a wheelchair.""
"
,,
6,5,"Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha,you're in a wheelchair.
"
,,
6,5,"What's that supposed to mean?
"
,,
6,5,"Say, ""I bet you can't get a boner.""
"
,,
6,5,"I bet you can't get a boner.
"
,,
6,5,"That's not very nice, Brian.
"
,,
6,5,"""Neither is your mother's ass.""
"
,,
6,5,"Neither is your mother's ass.
"
,,
6,5,"Well, I'll give you that one.
"
,,
6,5,"Now tell him you've always thought he was handsome.
"
,,
6,5,"I've always thought you were handsome.
"
,,
6,5,"Well, I got to tell you, Brian,
"
,,
6,5,"I'm relieved to hear you say that.
"
,,
6,5,"Please call me if you see any sign of Stewie.
"
,,
6,5,"Tell him, ""Ha-ha-ha-ha,
"
,,
6,5,"just kidding about the handsome thing.""
"
,,
6,5," Oh, come on.
"
,,
6,5," Do it!
"
,,
6,5,"Come on, that means a lot to him.
"
,,
6,5,"Ha-ha-ha-ha,just kidding
"
,,
6,5,"about the handsome thing.
"
,,
6,5,"Ah, well, that's,uh, disappointing.
"
,,
6,5,"I needed that boost today.
"
,,
6,5,"All right, I'll see you later.
"
,,
6,5,"All right, Lois,I'm hungry.
"
,,
6,5,"Take those breasts out.
"
,,
6,5,"Wait a minute.You could have drugged this.
"
,,
6,5,"Well, I'm no fool. Brian, taste this.
"
,,
6,5," What?
"
,,
6,5," Go on. Taste it!
"
,,
6,5,"You're the guinea pig!
"
,,
6,5,"Lois, he's got a gun.
"
,,
6,5,"Look, I'll do it myself.How about that?
"
,,
6,5,"Uh, I don't know.He kind of asked me.
"
,,
6,5,"I think we should do what he says.
"
,,
6,5," Well, yeah, but Brian...
"
,,
6,5," I'm-I'm totally willing to
"
,,
6,5,"do this for the family.
"
,,
6,5,"I'm not sure...
"
,,
6,5,"I'll do it.
"
,,
6,5,"Hey, Griffins, just checking in.
"
,,
6,5," Holy crap!
"
,,
6,5," Oh, my God!
"
,,
6,5,"Stewie, you killed him!
"
,,
6,5,"He's dead!
"
,,
6,5,"Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
"
,,
6,5,"What are we gonna do?!
"
,,
6,5," Oh, poor Cleveland!
"
,,
6,5," It's all right, Lois.
"
,,
6,5,"He's in heaven now.
"
,,
6,5,"I don't understand
"
,,
6,5,"why I need to give you a credit card imprint.
"
,,
6,5,"It's kind of a new policy.
"
,,
6,5,"I didn't see you ask the guy in front of me.
"
,,
6,5,"It's kind of brand-new.
"
,,
6,5,"Do you have a credit card?
"
,,
6,5,"I got a Sears card.
"
,,
6,5,"Ah, they're doing pretty well, huh?
"
,,
6,5,"One by my house
"
,,
6,5,"got a Mack-Donald's right in the store.
"
,,
6,5,"Won't be long before the police notice
"
,,
6,5,"Cleveland's disappearance.
"
,,
6,5,"Black man gone missing?
"
,,
6,5,"My God, the media will be all over that.
"
,,
6,5,"All right, if I see any cops following me,
"
,,
6,5,"the dog gets it.
"
,,
6,5,"Get in.
"
,,
6,5,"Come on!
"
,,
6,5,"Drive!
"
,,
6,5,"Drive! Drive!
"
,,
6,5,"Ooh, there's Joe.
"
,,
6,5,"Say, ""Joe, I think you're cool.""
"
,,
6,5,"Joe, I think you're cool.
"
,,
6,5,"Well, thank you, Brian. That's gonna get me
"
,,
6,5,"through the rest of this yard work.
"
,,
6,5,"""No, just kidding.You suck.""
"
,,
6,5,"No, just kidding. You suck.
"
,,
6,5,"""Queer"".
"
,,
6,5,"Queer
"
,,
6,5,"Ah, well, there goes my smile.
"
,,
6,5,"You know, you're not gonna get away with this.
"
,,
6,5,"Kidnapping me is one thing,
"
,,
6,5,"but you killed Cleveland.
"
,,
6,5,"You forget I'm the one holding the gun, Brian,
"
,,
6,5,"and you're gonna do exactly as I say.
"
,,
6,5,"You mind if I ask where we're going?
"
,,
6,5,"You'll know soon enough,Brian.
"
,,
6,5,"The world will know soon enough.
"
,,
6,5,"I'll be as big as I should have been
"
,,
6,5,"when I was on American Idol.
"
,,
6,5,"Stewie, what the hell was that?
"
,,
6,5,"That was ""Lost in Your Eyes""
"
,,
6,5,"by Debbie Gibson.
"
,,
6,5,"One of the worst I've ever heard.
"
,,
6,5,"Okay.
"
,,
6,5,"Stewie, you shouldn't actually even be alive,
"
,,
6,5,"you sniveling little creep.
"
,,
6,5,"I hate you so much
"
,,
6,5,"I want to shoot you in your face.
"
,,
6,5,"All right.
"
,,
6,5,"Honey, I like you, but you're just
"
,,
6,5,"not right for this competition.
"
,,
6,5,"Yo, dawg, I got to tell you for me, man,
"
,,
6,5,"that was not even half good, dude.
"
,,
6,5,"You can't sing. 
"
,,
6,5,"What're you doing, Stewie?
"
,,
6,5,"I don't even care!
"
,,
6,5,"They don't know what they's talkin' 'bout!
"
,,
6,5,"Next time they hear 'bout me,
"
,,
6,5,"they, they's gonna be, like,
"
,,
6,5,"""We was wrong about Stewie,""
"
,,
6,5,"cause I's gonna be huge.
"
,,
6,5,"I's gonna be bigger than
"
,,
6,5,"every one of all y'alls.
"
,,
6,5,"Hey, hey, you know what we should do, guys,
"
,,
6,5,"while we're here tied up like this?
"
,,
6,5,"What?
"
,,
6,5,"We should come up with a totally bogus rumor
"
,,
6,5,"about a celebrity.
"
,,
6,5,"And then when we get outta here,
"
,,
6,5,"we'll spread it around as much as we can.
"
,,
6,5,"That sounds like fun.
"
,,
6,5,"Actually, that does sound like fun.
"
,,
6,5,"What'd you have in mind?
"
,,
6,5,"Okay, okay, how about this?
"
,,
6,5,"Hey, did you guys hear about
"
,,
6,5,"Rob Schneider?
"
,,
6,5,"Somebody told me he goes down
"
,,
6,5,"to Home Depot
"
,,
6,5,"and pays the migrant workers
"
,,
6,5,"to go to his house
"
,,
6,5,"and choke him in the shower.
"
,,
6,5,"I could buy that.
"
,,
6,5,"That sounds like something he'd do.
"
,,
6,5,"Well, I think that's awful
"
,,
6,5,"that Rob Schneider does that.
"
,,
6,5,"Yeah, isn't that a disgusting absolute fact?
"
,,
6,5,"Yay! We're starting a rumor!
"
,,
6,5,"Wait a minute.
"
,,
6,5,"Chris, are you clapping?
"
,,
6,5,"Yeah.
"
,,
6,5,"So your hands are free?
"
,,
6,5,"Yeah.
"
,,
6,5,"Stewie didn't tie up your hands?
"
,,
6,5,"No, he must have forgot.
"
,,
6,5,"You realize we've
"
,,
6,5,"been sitting here for 14 hours?
"
,,
6,5,"Well, get pissy if you want, Mom.
"
,,
6,5,"I've enjoyed the time we've had as a family.
"
,,
6,5,"What is it?
"
,,
6,5,"What did you do?!
"
,,
6,5,"You almost shot me,
"
,,
6,5,"you son of a bitch!
"
,,
6,5,"That's because you yelled.
"
,,
6,5,"No, you shot the gun first.
"
,,
6,5,"That's why I yelled.
"
,,
6,5,"""That's why I yelled...""
"
,,
6,5,"I'm watching you, buddy.
"
,,
6,5,"There's got to besome clue in here
"
,,
6,5,"that'll tell us where Stewie might have gone.
"
,,
6,5,"Wow! Look at all this cool stuff!
"
,,
6,5,"Man, what do you think these things do?
"
,,
6,5,"Huh! Guess it doesn't do anything.
"
,,
6,5,"Well, that seems odd.
"
,,
6,5,"Oh, my God!Peter, you're me!
"
,,
6,5,"Holy crap!
"
,,
6,5,"Ah! Sweet!
"
,,
6,5,"Squeeze, squeeze.
"
,,
6,5,"All right, pull in here.
"
,,
6,5,"The CIA?
"
,,
6,5,"What the hell are we doing here?
"
,,
6,5,"You'll need CIA credentials, Brian.
"
,,
6,5,"What do you want your alias to be?
"
,,
6,5," What are you talking about? I'm not gonna go...
"
,,
6,5," Pick a name for yourself!
"
,,
6,5," Willem Dafoe.
"
,,
6,5," Ooh! Not that one.
"
,,
6,5,"I used to have a Willem Dafoe living under my bed.
"
,,
6,5,"Hey. You're asleep yet?
"
,,
6,5,"No.
"
,,
6,5,"Just checking.
"
,,
6,5,"What, exactly,
"
,,
6,5,"are you looking for?
"
,,
6,5,"According tom y schematics,
"
,,
6,5,"it should be right in here.
"
,,
6,5,"This is it, Brian! My plan for world domination
"
,,
6,5,"is about to come to fruition.
"
,,
6,5,"Stewie, for God's sake,th
"
,,
6,5,"What are you trying to do?!
"
,,
6,5,"Once I locate the proper code sequence,
"
,,
6,5,"this terminal will allow me
"
,,
6,5,"to take command of the satellites
"
,,
6,5,"which control the world's power grid.
"
,,
6,5,"Once they're under my control,
"
,,
6,5,"the entire world will be subject to my whims.
"
,,
6,5,"Go away, you paper clip!
"
,,
6,5,"No one likes you!
"
,,
6,5,"we're breaking down the door!</i>
"
,,
6,5," I love you, Katie.
"
,,
6,5," I love you, too, Tom.
"
,,
6,5,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
6,5,"I'm free!
"
,,
6,5,"The force field is down!
"
,,
6,5,"Go now!
"
,,
6,5,"I'd drop the gun if I were you, Joe.
"
,,
6,5," What? It's Stan.
"
,,
6,5," Oh. Sorry, You look sort alike someone from...
"
,,
6,5,"Anyway, I'd drop the gun if I were you.
"
,,
6,5,"I now control the entire planet's power grid,
"
,,
6,5,"and unless you want me
"
,,
6,5,"to send you all back to the Dark Ages,
"
,,
6,5,"you'll do exactly as I say.
"
,,
6,5,"What are your demands?
"
,,
6,5,"We interrupt this program
"
,,
6,5,"to bring you a special message
"
,,
6,5,"from the new president of the world.
"
,,
6,5,"Greetings, loyal minions.
"
,,
6,5,"Stewie?!
"
,,
6,5," Oh, my God!
"
,,
6,5," What the hell?!
"
,,
6,5,"Good gravy!
"
,,
6,5,"Seor Rob Schneider!
"
,,
6,5,"You must come see the news!
"
,,
6,5,"I'm not paying you guys to watch TV.
"
,,
6,5,"Now, get in the damn shower!
"
,,
6,5,"Oh, Brian, come here.
"
,,
6,5,"I want you to hear my presidential
"
,,
6,5,"address for Saint Rupert's Day.
"
,,
6,5,"I'm unveiling all the new laws I've passed.
"
,,
6,5,"Screw off.I don't want anything
"
,,
6,5,"to do with you or your damn laws.
"
,,
6,5,"Oh, just take a look, will you?
"
,,
6,5,"You're banning straight-to-video Disney films?
"
,,
6,5,"Absolutely.I mean, look at this.
"
,,
6,5,"Aladdin 4: Jafar May Need Glasses.
"
,,
6,5,"Number one.Number two.
"
,,
6,5,"Number one.Number two.
"
,,
6,5,"Um... about the same.
"
,,
6,5,"Number one mightbe a tiny bit better.
"
,,
6,5,"Number three.Number four.
"
,,
6,5,"Number three.
"
,,
6,5,"Five... and six.
"
,,
6,5,"Five... and six.
"
,,
6,5,"About the same?
"
,,
6,5,"Yeah. They're pretty much...
"
,,
6,5,"Can I see five one more time?
"
,,
6,5,"Five... and six.
"
,,
6,5,"Yeah, they're about the same.
"
,,
6,5,"Greetings, unwashed masses.
"
,,
6,5,"The following laws will
"
,,
6,5,"go into effect immediately.
"
,,
6,5,"From this day forward,all the nation's milk
"
,,
6,5,"must come from Hilary Swank's breasts.
"
,,
6,5,"Hey, I don't give a damn what you want!
"
,,
6,5,"Just get the hell off of my property!
"
,,
6,5,"Look, Hilary, all I know is it's breakfast time,
"
,,
6,5,"I've got this bowl of Corn Flakes,
"
,,
6,5,"and I gotta beat work at at 9:00
"
,,
6,5,"So what are we going to do here?
"
,,
6,5,"Not so fast.Did you know
"
,,
6,5,"you'd have to eat 17 bowls of those Corn Flakes
"
,,
6,5,"to get the same nutritional value
"
,,
6,5,"in one bowl of Total?
"
,,
6,5,"Say, that's a lot easier than eating 17 bowls.
"
,,
6,5,"And it's easier on my breasts!
"
,,
6,5,"Everybody wins!
"
,,
6,5,"Get your milk from her.</i>
"
,,
6,5,"Yeah!
"
,,
6,5,"Also, as I've had quite enough
"
,,
6,5,"of the fat man,
"
,,
6,5,"anyone who sees Peter Griffin must
"
,,
6,5,"throw apples at him.
"
,,
6,5,"Yeah, I'd like to make a deposit.
"
,,
6,5," What the hell?!
"
,,
6,5," It's the law, sir.
"
,,
6,5,"And, finally, anyone who uses the terms ""irregardless,""
"
,,
6,5,"""a whole 'nother""
"
,,
6,5,"or ""all of the sudden""
"
,,
6,5,"shall be sent to a work camp.
"
,,
6,5,"That is enough!
"
,,
6,5,"Peter, I am not going to stand by
"
,,
6,5,"while other people suffer at the hands
"
,,
6,5,"of my own baby.
"
,,
6,5,"I brought Stewie into this world.
"
,,
6,5,"It's time for me to take him out!
"
,,
6,5,"How the hell are you gonna do that?
"
,,
6,5," Sorry, Dad!
"
,,
6,5," That's okay, Chris.
"
,,
6,5,"You're a good boy,following the law.
"
,,
6,5,"But you, Meg,you're going to jail.
"
,,
6,5,"All right, Peter.I'm going to kill Stewie.
"
,,
6,5,"Dinner's in the oven.
"
,,
6,5,"All you have to do is
"
,,
6,5,"turn it to 350 at about 5:15.
"
,,
6,5,"Yeah, okay, Lois.
"
,,
6,5," Are you listening?
"
,,
6,5," Yeah.
"
,,
6,5,"What did I just say?
"
,,
6,5,"Turn the oven to 350at 5:15. I heard it!
"
,,
6,5," All right, sir. Your presidential portrait is finished.
"
,,
6,5," Let me see.
"
,,
6,5,"Ah! Excellent.
"
,,
6,5,"Much better than the one Gary Larson did.
"
,,
6,5,"Why would I even be talking to a chicken?
"
,,
6,5,"Lois!
"
,,
6,5,"Stewie's terror has come to an end!
"
,,
6,5,"I will not stand by while you make
"
,,
6,5,"innocent people suffer!
"
,,
6,5,"Bring it on, bitch!
"
,,
6,5,"Time for me to finish what I started anyway.
"
,,
6,5,"Go ahead, Lois. Do it.
"
,,
6,5,"Shoot me.
"
,,
6,5,"Shoot your little baby Stewie.
"
,,
6,5,"I can't do it. You're a terrible,evil child,
"
,,
6,5,"but you're still my baby,and
"
,,
6,5,"I could never hurt you.
"
,,
6,5,"Well, that works out perfectly
"
,,
6,5,"because I can hurt you!
"
,,
6,5,"Say hi to Cleveland for me.
"
,,
6,5,"Oh, and Mr. Weed.
"
,,
6,5,"It's just been revoked!
"
,,
6,5,"Uh... Peter, he didn't really set you up
"
,,
6,5,"for that Lethal Weapon line.
"
,,
6,5,"It... it doesn'treally work here.
"
,,
6,5,"Oh.
"
,,
6,5,"I'll have what she's having!
"
,,
6,5,"That's... better?
"
,,
6,5,"SIMULACION
"
,,
6,5,"FINALIZADA
"
,,
6,5,"Hey, Stewie,we got a postcard from
"
,,
6,5,"Peter and Lois on the cruise. 
"
,,
6,5,"What are you doing?
"
,,
6,5,"Oh, hello, Brian. Well, you recall
"
,,
6,5,"my complaining
"
,,
6,5,"about Lois and the fat man
"
,,
6,5,"not taking me with them?
"
,,
6,5,"Yeah.Yes.
"
,,
6,5,"Well, you said
"
,,
6,5,"I didn't have it in me to kill Lois,
"
,,
6,5,"so I was just running a simulation
"
,,
6,5,"to find out exactly
"
,,
6,5,"how killing her and taking over
"
,,
6,5,"the world would play out for me.
"
,,
6,5,"Yeah? How did that go?
"
,,
6,5,"Not well, Brian. Not well.
"
,,
6,5,"I suppose I'm not ready to kill Lois
"
,,
6,5,"or take over the world...
"
,,
6,5,"yet.
"
,,
6,5,"So, what you're saying is
"
,,
6,5,"that what you experienced in the simulation
"
,,
6,5,"didn't really happen or even matter.
"
,,
6,5,"Yes. That's correct.
"
,,
6,5,"So it was sort of like a dream.
"
,,
6,5,"No. It was a simulation.
"
,,
6,5,"Yes, but theoretically,
"
,,
6,5,"if someone watched the events
"
,,
6,5,"of that simulation from start to finish,
"
,,
6,5,"only to find out
"
,,
6,5,"that none of it really happened,
"
,,
6,5,"I mean, you don't think that would be just
"
,,
6,5,"like a giant middle finger to them?
"
,,
6,5,"Well hopefully,
"
,,
6,5,"they would have enjoyed the ride.
"
,,
6,5,"I don't know, man.
"
,,
6,5,"I think you piss a lot of people off that way.
"
,,
6,5,"Well, at least it didn't end like

6,6," Our wives stayed with us!

6,6," We did!
"

6,6,"Mom, how come, when we see
"

6,6,"these guys on the street corner,
"
,,
6,6,"you tell me not to stare a
"

6,6,"and today that's all we're doing?

6,6,"Ooh, on second thought, I got

6,6," I think we should see other people.

6,6,"Good morning, my American family.
"
,,
6,6,"Peter, where did you getthat suit?
"

6,6,"My God, you look like

6,6,"the Statue of Liberty's pimp.
"

6,6,"This is how a patriot dresses, Lois.
"
,,
6,6,"Boy, I never knew it would feel

6,6,"this good to love my country.

6,6,"You never really feel

6,6,"them love you back, but
"
,,
6,6,"that's okay because
"

6,6,"dans la parano post 9/11.
"
,,
6,6,"Brian, are you suggesting
"
,,
6,6,"that 9/11 didn't change everything?
"
,,
6,6," What? No, I was just...
"
,,
6,6," Because 9/11 changed everything, Brian.
"
,,
6,6,"Peter, you didn't even know
"
,,
6,6,"what 9/11 was until 2004.
"
,,
6,6,"Peter, what the hell are you doing?
"
,,
6,6,"Lois, I am doing my duty
"
,,
6,6,"as a patriotic American.
"
,,
6,6,"I'm sacrificing a goat
"
,,
6,6,"to Toby Keith.
"
,,
6,6,"Peter, Toby Keith
"
,,
6,6,"doesn't want to be fed.
"
,,
6,6,"Toby Keith wants to hunt.
"
,,
6,6,"Hey, listen, don't tell me
"
,,
6,6,"what Toby Keith wants.
"
,,
6,6,"I think I'm perfectly capable...
"
,,
6,6,"You're all doing
"
,,
6,6,"such a great job,
"
,,
6,6,"I wanted to play youa song I wrote
"
,,
6,6,"about what America means to me.
"
,,
6,6,"and give you AIDS</i>
"
,,
6,6,"Wow, Peter, you're really
"
,,
6,6,"becoming quite the patriot.
"
,,
6,6,"You bet I am.
"
,,
6,6,"I just had my penis tattooed
"
,,
6,6,"to look like the space shuttle
"
,,
6,6,"and my nads tattooed
"
,,
6,6,"to look like launch exhaust.
"
,,
6,6,"That was my idea; he stole it.</i>
"
,,
6,6,"to my penis.</i>
"
,,
6,6,"I can do something else</i>
"
,,
6,6,"like the Space Needle</i>
"
,,
6,6,"to some music.</i>
"
,,
6,6,"Man, that reallymakes me mad--
"
,,
6,6,"illegal immigrants
"
,,
6,6,"coming into this country,
"
,,
6,6,"taking all the good jobs
"
,,
6,6,"away from Americans.
"
,,
6,6,"Well, I am goingto make sure
"
,,
6,6,"people like that
"
,,
6,6,"stay out of Quahog from now on.
"
,,
6,6,"We are going
"
,,
6,6,"to patrol the borders
"
,,
6,6,"and keep this townas clean
"
,,
6,6,"as a Jewish porno.
"
,,
6,6,"I own four apartment buildings.
"
,,
6,6,"I have central air.
"
,,
6,6,"And a well-funded 401(k).
"
,,
6,6,"Oh... we are going to have
"
,,
6,6,"sex at some point.
"
,,
6,6,"All right, guys, it's going to be
"
,,
6,6,"a long night of border patrol,
"
,,
6,6,"so I brought along
"
,,
6,6,"Michael McDonald to help us out.
"
,,
6,6,"How's he going to help us?
"
,,
6,6,"He's going to do backup
"
,,
6,6,"vocals for everything we say.
"
,,
6,6,"How's he gonna know what we're saying?
"
,,
6,6," Is he gonna do it for all of us?
"
,,
6,6,"Yeah, I hired him for the night.
"
,,
6,6,"He costs like $250 an hour,
"
,,
6,6," so don't skimp on the conversation.
"
,,
6,6,"That sounds nice.
"
,,
6,6,"Peter, why did you have
"
,,
6,6,"my acupuncturist arrested?
"
,,
6,6,"Because he was
"
,,
6,6,"an illegal immigrant
"
,,
6,6,"and a threat to
"
,,
6,6,"our national security.
"
,,
6,6,"He was an 85-year-old
"
,,
6,6,"Korean Buddhist.
"
,,
6,6,"Or was he supreme
"
,,
6,6,"leader of al-Qaeda?
"
,,
6,6,"I guess we'll find out
"
,,
6,6,"if he ever gets a trial.
"
,,
6,6,"Peter, America was founded
"
,,
6,6,"by immigrants.
"
,,
6,6,"Everyone here is the descendant
"
,,
6,6,"of an immigrant.
"
,,
6,6,"They're a vital part of our society.
"
,,
6,6,"They are part of
"
,,
6,6,"theRebel Alliance and a traitor.
"
,,
6,6,"Take them away.
"
,,
6,6,"Peter, have you seen Stewie's
"
,,
6,6,"Speedy Gonzales video?
"
,,
6,6,"He won't go tosleep without it.
"
,,
6,6," I threw it away.
"
,,
6,6," What?!
"
,,
6,6,"What the hell, man?!
"
,,
6,6,"I don't throw away your stuff.
"
,,
6,6," And where's my goat?
"
,,
6,6," Peter, why would you do that?
"
,,
6,6,"Because Speedy Gonzales
"
,,
6,6,"is an immigrant
"
,,
6,6,"and a bad influence
"
,,
6,6,"on our children,
"
,,
6,6,"so I created
"
,,
6,6,"his Americanequivalent
"
,,
6,6,"Rapid Dave.
"
,,
6,6," Yeah?</i>
"
,,
6,6,"Quickly, quickly,quickly, run fast!</i>
"
,,
6,6,"Hey, Fuad, can I buy you
"
,,
6,6,"a cup of coffee?
"
,,
6,6,"Oh-ho-ho, yes!
"
,,
6,6,"Is funny because is free.
"
,,
6,6," Anyone can have.
"
,,
6,6," That's right.
"
,,
6,6," That's the joke.
"
,,
6,6," Oh... yes.
"
,,
6,6,"Why, you son of a bitch.
"
,,
6,6," Angela, I have a complaint.
"
,,
6,6," What is it, Griffin?
"
,,
6,6,"I think Fuad is
"
,,
6,6,"an illegal immigrant,
"
,,
6,6,"and I cannot stand by
"
,,
6,6,"while he steals wages
"
,,
6,6,"and opportunities from citizens.
"
,,
6,6,"I mean, this is
"
,,
6,6,"an American company.
"
,,
6,6,"You don't see Nike or Microsoft
"
,,
6,6,"or General Motors
"
,,
6,6,"or Ford or Boeing
"
,,
6,6,"or Coca-Cola or Kellogg's
"
,,
6,6,"profiting from
"
,,
6,6,"non-American labor.
"
,,
6,6,"Is funny because they all do.
"
,,
6,6,"You have a point, Griffin.
"
,,
6,6,"Maybe we should run
"
,,
6,6,"a company-wide check
"
,,
6,6,"to make sure all our personnel
"
,,
6,6,"are legal citizens.
"
,,
6,6,"Now you're talking, Angela.
"
,,
6,6,"This country needs more immigrants
"
,,
6,6,"like my cousin, Peter the pig,
"
,,
6,6,"needs a new house.
"
,,
6,6,"Uh, I wouldn't do that
"
,,
6,6,"if I were you.
"
,,
6,6," What?
"
,,
6,6," I said, I wouldn't do that.
"
,,
6,6," I said knock it off!
"
,,
6,6," Why?
"
,,
6,6,"Because I just made stool in there,
"
,,
6,6,"and if you blow it down,
"
,,
6,6,"the whole woods is gonna stink.
"
,,
6,6,"Do you understand?
"
,,
6,6,"Do you understand me, sir?
"
,,
6,6,"Peter, what brings you here?
"
,,
6,6,"Hi, Mom.
"
,,
6,6,"Hey, uh, there'sa new policy at work
"
,,
6,6,"where everyone has to prove
"
,,
6,6,"they're an American,
"
,,
6,6,"and I need my birth certificate.
"
,,
6,6,"Oh. Oh, dear.
"
,,
6,6,"Peter, sit down.
"
,,
6,6,"I don't know how
"
,,
6,6,"to tell you this,
"
,,
6,6,"but you weren't born in America.
"
,,
6,6,"You were born in Mexico.
"
,,
6,6," What?!
"
,,
6,6," When I found out
"
,,
6,6,"that your real father
"
,,
6,6,"was a drunken Irishman,
"
,,
6,6,"I went to Mexico
"
,,
6,6,"to terminate my pregnancy.
"
,,
6,6,"But God had other plans,
"
,,
6,6,"and you were born right there.
"
,,
6,6,"You were so beautiful,
"
,,
6,6,"and I loved you.
"
,,
6,6,"But when I got back home,
"
,,
6,6,"I was so afraid of being judged
"
,,
6,6,"by the community
"
,,
6,6,"that I never filled out the paperwork
"
,,
6,6,"to make you a citizen
"
,,
6,6,"Mom... what are you saying?
"
,,
6,6,"Peter, as far as
"
,,
6,6,"the US government is concerned,
"
,,
6,6,"you're an illegal
"
,,
6,6,"Mexican immigrant.
"
,,
6,6,"Holy crap!
"
,,
6,6,"Looks like I've got
"
,,
6,6,"myself in a bind.
"
,,
6,6,"How will I get out of this one?
"
,,
6,6,"Stick around,
"
,,
6,6,"And Quagmire,and Joe, and Mort</i>
"
,,
6,6,"Peter, how come
"
,,
6,6,"you're not at work?
"
,,
6,6,"I got fired for being
"
,,
6,6,"an illegal immigrant.
"
,,
6,6,"Oh, dear.
"
,,
6,6,"You know, Peter, you can always
"
,,
6,6,"take a citizenship test.
"
,,
6,6,"I mean, if Wilmer Valderrama passed,
"
,,
6,6,"it can't be that difficult.
"
,,
6,6,"Well, by that logic, Lois,
"
,,
6,6,"it can't be that difficult
"
,,
6,6,"to nail Lindsay Lohan
"
,,
6,6,"I don't think it is.
"
,,
6,6,"Well, good news there.
"
,,
6,6,"All right, you want
"
,,
6,6,"to head down to the INS?
"
,,
6,6,"So, give me the good news--
"
,,
6,6,"did I pass?
"
,,
6,6,"I'm afraid it doesn't look
"
,,
6,6,"good for you, Seor Griffin.
"
,,
6,6,"So far, you've failed everything,
"
,,
6,6,"including the ""Behaving
"
,,
6,6,"like an American at the airport"" test.
"
,,
6,6,"No, it wasn't bad.
"
,,
6,6,"Yeah, I'm on the way
"
,,
6,6,"to the next plane now.
"
,,
6,6,"Yeah, I got a middle seat,
"
,,
6,6,"so I'm gonna see if I can switch.
"
,,
6,6,"Ooh, a Subarro.
"
,,
6,6,"I'm gonna get a big,
"
,,
6,6,"fat piece of pizza
"
,,
6,6,"so I got something
"
,,
6,6,"to stuff in my face
"
,,
6,6,"while I'm reading USA Today.
"
,,
6,6,"The only thing remaining
"
,,
6,6,"is the oral test,
"
,,
6,6,"which I will administer here.
"
,,
6,6,"Now, question number one,
"
,,
6,6,"""Who discovered America?""
"
,,
6,6," Dick York?
"
,,
6,6," No.
"
,,
6,6,"Dick Sargent.
"
,,
6,6,"It was Dick Sargent.
"
,,
6,6,"Question number two,
"
,,
6,6,"complete this sentence:
"
,,
6,6,"""The land of the free
"
,,
6,6,"and the home of the blank.""
"
,,
6,6," Home of the Whopper?
"
,,
6,6," You've got to be kidding me.
"
,,
6,6,"Mr. Griffin, if you were truly an American,
"
,,
6,6,"you would know our national anthem.
"
,,
6,6,"Now, wait a minute,
"
,,
6,6,"he is too an American.
"
,,
6,6,"We've been married
"
,,
6,6,"for almost 20 years.
"
,,
6,6,"Well, we hear that one
"
,,
6,6,"a lot around here.
"
,,
6,6,"Of course there's a very easy
"
,,
6,6,"way of detecting fraud.
"
,,
6,6,"Mr. Griffin, what is
"
,,
6,6,"your wife's birthday?
"
,,
6,6,"Uh... eh... Gim-gim-gimme another one,
"
,,
6,6,"gimme another one.
"
,,
6,6,"Where is your wife's hometown?
"
,,
6,6,"Uh... uh, uh,one more, one more.
"
,,
6,6,"What is your wife's favorite
"
,,
6,6,"outdoor activity ?
"
,,
6,6,"Uh, things an overcoat would say.
"
,,
6,6,"Um, I'm covered with water.
"
,,
6,6," Things an umbrellawould say.
"
,,
6,6," I'm-I'm...you wear me.
"
,,
6,6,"Uh, uh, uh, things
"
,,
6,6,"a festive bow tie would say.
"
,,
6,6,"You wear me to keep you dry.
"
,,
6,6,"Uh, uh, things Speed Stick would say.
"
,,
6,6," I keep your head dry.
"
,,
6,6," I said umbrella.
"
,,
6,6,"It's not umbrella.
"
,,
6,6,"Peter, what if I said
"
,,
6,6,"I keep your head dry,
"
,,
6,6,"you wear me in the bathroom?
"
,,
6,6,"Shower cap.
"
,,
6,6," There you go.
"
,,
6,6," Oh, man.
"
,,
6,6," Did you have fun?
"
,,
6,6," I had fun, yeah.
"
,,
6,6,"All right, we'll be back
"
,,
6,6,"after this.
"
,,
6,6,"Peter, what are you gonna do
"
,,
6,6,"without a job?
"
,,
6,6,"We can't just keep
"
,,
6,6,"eating into savings.
"
,,
6,6,"I'll just have to find a job
"
,,
6,6,"for an illegal immigrant.
"
,,
6,6,"I can't believe this is happening
"
,,
6,6,"to our family.
"
,,
6,6,"It's taken us all by surprise, Meg.
"
,,
6,6,"Like that realistic original ending
"
,,
6,6,"to Dirty Dancing.
"
,,
6,6,"Nobody puts Baby in a corner.
"
,,
6,6,"I do, because I'm her father
"
,,
6,6,"and she's 16.
"
,,
6,6," What are you, like 38?
"
,,
6,6," Forty-one.
"
,,
6,6,"""Hotel maid wanted.""
"
,,
6,6,"Ah, sweet, I could do that.
"
,,
6,6,"Housekeeping.
"
,,
6,6," Housekeeping.
"
,,
6,6," Housekeeping?
"
,,
6,6," Housekeeping!
"
,,
6,6," I come in anyway?
"
,,
6,6,"I come in anyway.
"
,,
6,6," Oh, my God!
"
,,
6,6," I said no!
"
,,
6,6," Okay, I clean?
"
,,
6,6," No! Get out of here!
"
,,
6,6," I clean now?
"
,,
6,6," No!
"
,,
6,6," I stay and watch?
"
,,
6,6," No!
"
,,
6,6," I get involved?
"
,,
6,6," What?
"
,,
6,6,"I get involved with lady?
"
,,
6,6," What doyou think?
"
,,
6,6," Turn around.
"
,,
6,6," I don't think so.
"
,,
6,6," Okay.
"
,,
6,6," You lend me money?
"
,,
6,6," No.
"
,,
6,6,"You drive my grandmother
"
,,
6,6,"to doctor's appointment?
"
,,
6,6," No! No, I'm not doing that.
"
,,
6,6," I stick finger in your mouth?
"
,,
6,6,"Housekeeping?
"
,,
6,6," Okay.
"
,,
6,6," Okay.
"
,,
6,6,"""Nanny wanted.""
"
,,
6,6,"Well, that sounds like a good job
"
,,
6,6,"for an immigrant.
"
,,
6,6,"Michael, did you hear
"
,,
6,6,"the good news?
"
,,
6,6,"We're getting a new nanny.
"
,,
6,6,"Oh, Jane, I'm ever so excited.
"
,,
6,6,"Do you suppose she'll be
"
,,
6,6,"everything we've dreamed?
"
,,
6,6,"Oh, I do hope so.
"
,,
6,6,"I've always imagined
"
,,
6,6,"the most beautiful...
"
,,
6,6,"Damn it!
"
,,
6,6,"Oh, Peter, you look exhausted.
"
,,
6,6,"I am, Lois.
"
,,
6,6,"Life as Mexican immigrant
"
,,
6,6,"is brutal.
"
,,
6,6,"Even after seven jobs
"
,,
6,6,"and joining Menudo,
"
,,
6,6,"I only made 25 bucks.
"
,,
6,6,"Now look, don't get upset,
"
,,
6,6,"but I've been so worried about you
"
,,
6,6,"that I asked someone for help.
"
,,
6,6," Who?
"
,,
6,6," Hello, fat ass.
"
,,
6,6,"Lois, immigrants
"
,,
6,6,"don't take handouts.
"
,,
6,6,"They just takeone DVD a month
"
,,
6,6,"from the house they're cleaning
"
,,
6,6,"until they have
"
,,
6,6,"a respectable collection.
"
,,
6,6,"It's not a handout, it's a job.
"
,,
6,6,"Daddy employs lots of immigrants,
"
,,
6,6,"and he said
"
,,
6,6,"you could work at the mansion.
"
,,
6,6,"Really?
"
,,
6,6,"Well, thanks lot,
"
,,
6,6,"Mr. Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
6,6,"I promise I won't let you down.
"
,,
6,6,"Well, they all do eventually.
"
,,
6,6,"Except for Noriega.
"
,,
6,6,"God bless him and his drug money.
"
,,
6,6,"I wish he were here today.
"
,,
6,6,"Hi, Mr. Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
6,6,"Oh, look who it is!
"
,,
6,6,"Come hereso I can give you a hug.
"
,,
6,6,"Come here so can give you a hug.
"
,,
6,6," Ah, there they are.
"
,,
6,6," Hi, Mom.
"
,,
6,6,"Hi grandma.
"
,,
6,6," Grandma.
"
,,
6,6," I've missed you.
"
,,
6,6,"Peter, I'm using you
"
,,
6,6,"as a house immigrant,
"
,,
6,6,"so take my family's luggage
"
,,
6,6,"to their rooms
"
,,
6,6,"and then go get settled down
"
,,
6,6,"at the servants quarters.
"
,,
6,6,"Right away,
"
,,
6,6,"Mr. Pewterschmidt, sir.
"
,,
6,6,"Daddy, we don't want
"
,,
6,6,"any special treatment.
"
,,
6,6,"We're here as a family,
"
,,
6,6,"and we're gonna live as a family.
"
,,
6,6,"Are you serious?
"
,,
6,6,"We come to a mansion,
"
,,
6,6,"and you want to live with the help?
"
,,
6,6,"Ugh, that's like going to a strip club
"
,,
6,6,"on a Tuesday afternoon.
"
,,
6,6,"Is there anyone here
"
,,
6,6,"who hasn't had a C-section?
"
,,
6,6,"Oh, no, that boy's ball fell
"
,,
6,6,"out of the cup.
"
,,
6,6,"Oh, but it's okay
"
,,
6,6,"because the ball is on a string
"
,,
6,6,"and attached to the cup.
"
,,
6,6,"Hola!
"
,,
6,6,"You must be the Griffins.
"
,,
6,6,"I am Gerardo,
"
,,
6,6,"the head groundskeeper.
"
,,
6,6,"You must be exhausted.
"
,,
6,6,"Come, come, let's get you
"
,,
6,6,"to your new home.
"
,,
6,6,"Hey, Senorita!
"
,,
6,6,"You got nice bread dough legs!
"
,,
6,6,"I got a blank prescription pad!
"
,,
6,6,"See, this isn't so bad.
"
,,
6,6,"Not so bad?
"
,,
6,6,"We're sharing a toolshed
"
,,
6,6,"with seven other families.
"
,,
6,6,"They're making the best of it.
"
,,
6,6,"Good morning,
"
,,
6,6,"Mr. Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
6,6,"It's 8:00 and I'm ready for work.
"
,,
6,6,"Good. Have a seat.
"
,,
6,6,"Drink that.
"
,,
6,6," What is it?
"
,,
6,6," My blood.
"
,,
6,6,"I'm a diabetic,
"
,,
6,6,"and I need you to test it.
"
,,
6,6," Isn't that dangerous?
"
,,
6,6," I don't know. Probably.
"
,,
6,6," I don't want to.
"
,,
6,6," You work for me.
"
,,
6,6," Now, drink it.
"
,,
6,6," No.
"
,,
6,6,"Drink my diabetic blood,
"
,,
6,6,"Peter, or you're fired.
"
,,
6,6,"Aw! I can't believe
"
,,
6,6,"you really did that.
"
,,
6,6,"Aw, that's nasty.
"
,,
6,6,"You're nasty.
"
,,
6,6,"Peter!
"
,,
6,6,"How was your first day?
"
,,
6,6,"Horrible.
"
,,
6,6,"I never worked so hard in my life.
"
,,
6,6,"How the hell do you guys
"
,,
6,6,"do this every day?
"
,,
6,6,"Immigrant life sucks.
"
,,
6,6,"But, Peter,
"
,,
6,6,"life in America is wonderful.
"
,,
6,6,"That is why we risk
"
,,
6,6,"everything to come here.
"
,,
6,6,"I don't know, Cheech. It seems
"
,,
6,6,"like a lot of work for no respect.
"
,,
6,6,"Peter, America is
"
,,
6,6,"theland of opportunity.
"
,,
6,6,"There are tall buildings,
"
,,
6,6,"cheeseburgers
"
,,
6,6,"and Fox's many
"
,,
6,6,"hit comedy series,
"
,,
6,6,"including That '70s Show,
"
,,
6,6,"and, uh...
"
,,
6,6,"But let me ask you something:
"
,,
6,6,"Don't you missyour home?
"
,,
6,6,"Of course.
"
,,
6,6,"We come to America for
"
,,
6,6,"financial opportunities, Peter,
"
,,
6,6,"but someday
"
,,
6,6,"we will return to Mexico
"
,,
6,6,"because our heritage
"
,,
6,6,"is rich and glorious.
"
,,
6,6,"Wait-wait, hang on a second.
"
,,
6,6,"Are you saying there's more
"
,,
6,6,"to being Mexican
"
,,
6,6,"than working hard
"
,,
6,6,"and lusting after big asses?
"
,,
6,6,"There is, Peter.
"
,,
6,6,"In fact, we are preparing
"
,,
6,6,"our Cinco de Mayo celebration.
"
,,
6,6,"As a Mexican,
"
,,
6,6,"you must experience it with us.
"
,,
6,6,"Well, kids, enjoy yourselves.
"
,,
6,6,"Cinco de Mayo is
"
,,
6,6,"as Mexican as it gets.
"
,,
6,6,"Wow, this is awesome!
"
,,
6,6,"And later, I'm gonna go lift
"
,,
6,6,"free weights in a parking lot!
"
,,
6,6,"Oh, Peter, I'm so proud
"
,,
6,6,"that you've embraced
"
,,
6,6,"these people as your own.
"
,,
6,6,"You've come a long way
"
,,
6,6,"from hating foreigners.
"
,,
6,6,"Well, Lois, life can surprise you
"
,,
6,6,"if you open your mind a little.
"
,,
6,6,"For example,
"
,,
6,6,"I used to hate the Japanese,
"
,,
6,6,"but then I saw Lou Diamond Phillips
"
,,
6,6,"in Young Guns
"
,,
6,6,"and now I don't hate
"
,,
6,6,"them anymore.
"
,,
6,6,"Peter, I don't think that
"
,,
6,6,"Lou Diamond Phillips is Japanese.
"
,,
6,6,"Eh, Chinese, Japanese,
"
,,
6,6,"dirty knees, look at these.
"
,,
6,6,"Hey, what do you say
"
,,
6,6,"we get some of them burritos?
"
,,
6,6,"I would love to feel
"
,,
6,6,"your mustache on my mustache.
"
,,
6,6,"Really?
"
,,
6,6,"Well, there's a lot more body hair
"
,,
6,6,"where that came from.
"
,,
6,6,"Oh, well, then no, thank you.
"
,,
6,6,"What the hell is going on here?
"
,,
6,6,"Why aren't you people working?
"
,,
6,6,"It's Cinco de Mayo,
"
,,
6,6,"Mr. Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
6,6,"Look, I don't care
"
,,
6,6,"what day it is Mexico,
"
,,
6,6,"in America we work on weekdays.
"
,,
6,6,"Now, do your jobs
"
,,
6,6,"or I'll deport your lazy asses
"
,,
6,6,"back to the Third World.
"
,,
6,6,"Wait a minute,
"
,,
6,6,"hang on, everybody.
"
,,
6,6,"What he just said does not represent
"
,,
6,6,"the America that I know and love.
"
,,
6,6,"This country used to welcome
"
,,
6,6,"our kind with open arms.
"
,,
6,6,"But men like Carter Pewterschmidt
"
,,
6,6,"use us for cheap labor,
"
,,
6,6,"and then-and then
"
,,
6,6,"try to punish us
"
,,
6,6,"when we demand to be treated
"
,,
6,6,"like human beings.
"
,,
6,6,"Well, no more!
"
,,
6,6,"Immigrants built this country,
"
,,
6,6,"and I say it's time for us
"
,,
6,6,"to take it back!
"
,,
6,6,"Who's with me?!
"
,,
6,6,"Could you say whole speech
"
,,
6,6,"again in Spanish?
"
,,
6,6,"What the hell is that?
"
,,
6,6,"Get out, the way,
"
,,
6,6,"Mr. Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
6,6,"We are here to take what's ours.
"
,,
6,6,"Well, I mean,
"
,,
6,6,"technically it's yours, but
"
,,
6,6,"we don't feel like you deserve it,
"
,,
6,6,"so, we're calling it ours
"
,,
6,6,"and taking it anyway.
"
,,
6,6,"But, Peter, why would you want to harm
"
,,
6,6,"a fellow American citizen?
"
,,
6,6," What?!
"
,,
6,6," All I have to do is
"
,,
6,6,"make one call
"
,,
6,6,"to friend of mine in Washington,
"
,,
6,6,"and he can push
"
,,
6,6,"your paperwork through.
"
,,
6,6,"You'll officially be
"
,,
6,6,"an American citizen.
"
,,
6,6,"Not good enough,
"
,,
6,6,"Mr. Pewterschmidt.
"
,,
6,6,"I want citizenship
"
,,
6,6,"for everyone here.
"
,,
6,6,"Peter, you do not have to do this.
"
,,
6,6,"Yes, I do, Gerardo.
"
,,
6,6,"This great land should be
"
,,
6,6,"everything to you that it is to me.
"
,,
6,6,"A land where a man is paid
"
,,
6,6,"a wage he can live on.
"
,,
6,6,"A land where
"
,,
6,6,"we flush every time.
"
,,
6,6,"A land where 17 miles
"
,,
6,6,"is not walking distance.
"
,,
6,6,"A land where meals
"
,,
6,6,"are not purchased from a truck
"
,,
6,6,"and then eaten
"
,,
6,6,"in a different truck.
"
,,
6,6,"All right, all right,
"
,,
6,6,"you make your point.
"
,,
6,6,"It's getting a little offensive.
"
,,
6,6,"That's my only offer.
"
,,
6,6,"Take it or leave it.
"
,,
6,6,"Peter, you must go.
"
,,
6,6,"We will find our own way.
"
,,
6,6,"I'll never forget you, Gerardo.
"
,,
6,6,"Boy, I sure am gonna
"
,,
6,6,"miss Reynaldo.
"
,,
6,6,"But I'm glad I'm finally
"
,,
6,6,"an American again.
"
,,
6,6,"Being an immigrant
"
,,
6,6,"is areal pain in the ass.
"
,,
6,6,"I'm glad too, Peter.
"
,,
6,6,"But I did enjoy learning
"
,,
6,6,"about another culture.
"
,,
6,6,"Yeah, you know, so did I.
"
,,
6,6,"Well, I guess
"
,,
6,6,"everything's back to normal.
"
,,
6,6,"Oh, man, not this guy again.
"
,,
6,6,"Fa-art!
"
,,
6,7,"Good evening. I'm Tom Tucker
"
,,
6,7,"with a Channel Five News
"
,,
6,7,"Special Report.
"
,,
6,7,"And I'm Diane Simmons.
"
,,
6,7,"A flash flood warning
"
,,
6,7,"is in effect
"
,,
6,7,"as rain continues
"
,,
6,7,"to pound Rhode Island.
"
,,
6,7,"Let's go to Asian reporter
"
,,
6,7,"Tricia Takanawa,
"
,,
6,7,"Who's gonna tell us
"
,,
6,7,"all about the rain.
"
,,
6,7,"Tom, residents all over Quahog
"
,,
6,7,"have been affected
"
,,
6,7,"by the heavy rains,
"
,,
6,7,"although some are doing
"
,,
6,7,"their best to ride it out.
"
,,
6,7,"For example, I'm here with
"
,,
6,7,"Rides-a-Ten-Speed-
"
,,
6,7,"Everywhere Guy.
"
,,
6,7,"Sir, why are you riding
"
,,
6,7,"your ten-speed in the rain?
"
,,
6,7,"I don't mind-- a little
"
,,
6,7,"drizzle never hurt anybody.
"
,,
6,7,"I like riding the ten-speed
"
,,
6,7,"because it's fun,
"
,,
6,7,"it gives me energy, and
"
,,
6,7,"it's a great way to stay in shape.
"
,,
6,7,"What do you do
"
,,
6,7,"for a living?
"
,,
6,7,"I work in accounts receivable
"
,,
6,7,"at Quahog Insurance.
"
,,
6,7,"Uh, it's not too demanding,
"
,,
6,7,"the pay is good,
"
,,
6,7,"and it's a great way
"
,,
6,7,"to stay in shape.
"
,,
6,7,"Well, we should wrap this up--
"
,,
6,7,"you're getting wet.
"
,,
6,7,"I'm living life before
"
,,
6,7,"the cancer I have
"
,,
6,7,"kills me
"
,,
6,7,"so I don't mind the rain.
"
,,
6,7,"Water feels good on my skin.
"
,,
6,7,"It's cool, refreshing,
"
,,
6,7,"and it's a great way
"
,,
6,7,"to stay in shape.
"
,,
6,7," What kind of cancer?
"
,,
6,7," It's rectal cancer.
"
,,
6,7,"It's slowly eating away
"
,,
6,7,"at my lower insides.
"
,,
6,7,"It's a quick process, both
"
,,
6,7,"painful and untreatable,
"
,,
6,7,"and it's a great way
"
,,
6,7,"to stay in shape.
"
,,
6,7,"Thank you, Tricia.
"
,,
6,7,"Some local residents
"
,,
6,7,"have even been evacuated
"
,,
6,7,"to Quahog Stadium
"
,,
6,7,"for their own protection.
"
,,
6,7," Why do I have to stay here?
"
,,
6,7," We just think you'll be safer.
"
,,
6,7," But my house is dry.
"
,,
6,7," Here's a blanket.
"
,,
6,7,"If you're looking for a bathroom,
"
,,
6,7,"it's all around you.
"
,,
6,7,"Oh, crap, Peter,
"
,,
6,7,"it's a flash flood!
"
,,
6,7,"Oh, man, I better save
"
,,
6,7,"my autographed picture of Dean Cain!
"
,,
6,7,"You know, from before he got
"
,,
6,7,"all desperate for attention.
"
,,
6,7,"Hey, is that Dean Cain
"
,,
6,7,"on that park bench?
"
,,
6,7,"Oh, God!
"
,,
6,7,"Lois! Uh, you may want
"
,,
6,7,"to come down here!
"
,,
6,7," Oh, my God!
"
,,
6,7," I know--about the water, right?
"
,,
6,7,"Wow! Cool!
"
,,
6,7," Hey, Chris, come here.
"
,,
6,7," What? Why?
"
,,
6,7,"Just come here.
"
,,
6,7,"What is it, Dad?
"
,,
6,7,"Does it feel like the water
"
,,
6,7,"suddenly just got warmer?
"
,,
6,7,"That's right, it's pee
"
,,
6,7,"that makes it warmer.
"
,,
6,7,"Peter, the water's rising fast!
"
,,
6,7,"We got to get out of here!
"
,,
6,7,"Hang on, Lois. There's a case
"
,,
6,7,"of beer in the fridge.
"
,,
6,7,"I can't leave that behind!
"
,,
6,7,"Meg, you're a goodswimmer--
"
,,
6,7,"go get it.
"
,,
6,7,"What?! But, Dad...
"
,,
6,7,"And for God's sake,do not be afraid
"
,,
6,7,"to make me a sandwich
"
,,
6,7,"while you're in there.
"
,,
6,7,"Peter, Meg's been in
"
,,
6,7,"there a long time.
"
,,
6,7,"Boy, you cannot wait to criticize her
"
,,
6,7,"at every turn, can you?
"
,,
6,7,"Go get her!
"
,,
6,7,"Well, Lois, I am sorry
"
,,
6,7,"for snapping at you earlier;
"
,,
6,7,"You were right to critizise Meg.
"
,,
6,7,"She could not even handle
"
,,
6,7,"this simple task.
"
,,
6,7,"She's in there right now
"
,,
6,7,"taking a nap underwater.
"
,,
6,7,"For God's sake, save her!
"
,,
6,7,"My God, we better get her to a hospital.
"
,,
6,7,"She doesn't look too good.
"
,,
6,7,"Yes, she looks worse than Andy Garcia
"
,,
6,7,"when he had his conjoined twin.
"
,,
6,7,"I had a great time with you tonight.
"
,,
6,7,"You're really amazing.
"
,,
6,7,"Thanks, Andy.
"
,,
6,7,"I had a great time, too.
"
,,
6,7,"How about some love for
"
,,
6,7,"shoulder guy over here?
"
,,
6,7,"Shoulder guy wants
"
,,
6,7,"to get in on this.
"
,,
6,7," Just ignore him.
"
,,
6,7," Okay...
"
,,
6,7,"So, do you maybe want
"
,,
6,7,"to go in the other room?
"
,,
6,7,"Sure. Sounds good.
"
,,
6,7,"And shoulder guy's going with ya.
"
,,
6,7," Rick, shut up.
"
,,
6,7," Hey, bitch, want to suck on my tooth?
"
,,
6,7,"Mr. and Mrs. Griffin,
"
,,
6,7,"I'm afraid your coma's in a daughter.
"
,,
6,7,"I mean... I mean,
"
,,
6,7,"your daughter's in a coma!
"
,,
6,7,"What... Oh, my God,did you...
"
,,
6,7,"did you hear what I said?
"
,,
6,7,"Brain freeze!
"
,,
6,7,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
6,7,"That one's going
"
,,
6,7,"in the Christmas letter.
"
,,
6,7,"Oh, my God, Peter,
"
,,
6,7," what if she doesn't come out of it?
"
,,
6,7," I know, Lois.
"
,,
6,7,"I never realized until now
"
,,
6,7,"how much I've taken her for granted.
"
,,
6,7,"I mean, she's my only daughter,
"
,,
6,7,"and I
"
,,
6,7,"feel like I've never treated her
"
,,
6,7,"as well as I should've.
"
,,
6,7,"Hey, Meg, you got
"
,,
6,7,"something on you shirt.
"
,,
6,7,"Hi, Dad.
"
,,
6,7,"Aw, don't be too hard
"
,,
6,7,"on yourself, Peter.
"
,,
6,7,"We all do things that
"
,,
6,7,"we're not proud of.
"
,,
6,7,"Well, I am gonna change.
"
,,
6,7,"You hear me, Meg?
"
,,
6,7,"If you come out of this,
"
,,
6,7,"I am gonna treat you like a princess
"
,,
6,7,"for the rest of your life.
"
,,
6,7,"'Cause I been a worse father
"
,,
6,7,"than Abraham.
"
,,
6,7,"You want to tell me
"
,,
6,7,"what the ... that was?
"
,,
6,7,"Excuse me, I'm Dr. Milano.
"
,,
6,7,"I'm the intern for this floor.
"
,,
6,7,"You know, you guys
"
,,
6,7,"can probably go on home.
"
,,
6,7,"We let you know if there's any change
"
,,
6,7,"in your daughter'scondition.
"
,,
6,7,"Wow, you'rea real doctor?
"
,,
6,7,"Hey, does Scrubs work here?
"
,,
6,7,"I love that guy.
"
,,
6,7,"I want to meet Scrubs,
"
,,
6,7,"and I want to meet black Scrubs, too.
"
,,
6,7,"Well, hello, sleepyhead.
"
,,
6,7,"I'm Michael.
"
,,
6,7,"Hi, Michael.I'm Meg.
"
,,
6,7," Meg!
"
,,
6,7," Oh, my God! Meg, you're OK !
"
,,
6,7,"Oh, Meg, my beautiful daughter!
"
,,
6,7,"Oh, thing sare gonna be different.
"
,,
6,7,"No more will I treat you
"
,,
6,7,"like some kind of alien.
"
,,
6,7,"to minimum safe distance.</i>
"
,,
6,7,"Stop. Not so fast, y'all.
"
,,
6,7,"You think you can just up
"
,,
6,7,"and run away, you crazy.
"
,,
6,7,"I like to eat people
"
,,
6,7,"from other planets,
"
,,
6,7,"especially y'all.
"
,,
6,7,"I likes to eat you
"
,,
6,7,"with my little mouth, too.
"
,,
6,7,"Oh, now, y'all get back up
"
,,
6,7,"inside me, little mouth.
"
,,
6,7,"I wants to play, too.
"
,,
6,7,"Get back inside--
"
,,
6,7,"I'll get you when we's eatin' em.
"
,,
6,7," So, what is ityou wanted to show me?
"
,,
6,7," That, Brian.
"
,,
6,7,"What? It's a rundown old house.
"
,,
6,7,"Well, yes, I-I suppose
"
,,
6,7,"to the untrained eye
"
,,
6,7,"that's what it would look like.
"
,,
6,7,"Walk inside with me, Brian.
"
,,
6,7,"This is disgusting--it smells, it's falling apart,
"
,,
6,7,"and you can hear the mice
"
,,
6,7,"humping in the wall.
"
,,
6,7,"That was so awesome!
"
,,
6,7,"That's why we can get it
"
,,
6,7,"for a steal, Brian.
"
,,
6,7,"We fix it up and sell it
"
,,
6,7,"for a huge profit!
"
,,
6,7,"You're crazy. No, I'm not gonna buy
"
,,
6,7,"this house with you.
"
,,
6,7,"Fine, I'll just give the profits
"
,,
6,7,"to another investor.
"
,,
6,7," Plenty of others interested.
"
,,
6,7," Oh yeah, like who?
"
,,
6,7,"Mort Goldman, for one.
"
,,
6,7,"Says it's a smart investment.
"
,,
6,7,"But what does he know?
"
,,
6,7,"He's only Jewish.
"
,,
6,7,"All right, I'm in.
"
,,
6,7,"Oh, there's my little angel!
"
,,
6,7,"Here, let me get
"
,,
6,7,"that for you, sweetie.
"
,,
6,7,"Thanks, Dad!
"
,,
6,7,"Wow, Peter, I got to say,
"
,,
6,7,"you've really been true
"
,,
6,7,"to your word about treating Meg better.
"
,,
6,7,"She's my only daughter, Lois.
"
,,
6,7,"She needs to be protected,
"
,,
6,7,"like a rare gemstone,
"
,,
6,7,"or the herniated scrotum
"
,,
6,7,"of an older gentleman.
"
,,
6,7,"Well, I think you've been wonderful.
"
,,
6,7,"Like when you took her to
"
,,
6,7,"that new movie,
"
,,
6,7,"I'm Rich and You're Poor,
"
,,
6,7,"but Let's Dance Together.
"
,,
6,7,"I'm rich and you're poor,
"
,,
6,7,"but let's dance together.
"
,,
6,7," Society won't like it.
"
,,
6,7," I don't care.
"
,,
6,7,"Good for you, good for you.
"
,,
6,7,"Yeah, and I can't believe
"
,,
6,7,"how you stood up
"
,,
6,7,"to Connie D'Amico for me.
"
,,
6,7," Hey, Meg.
"
,,
6,7," Uh, hi, Connie.
"
,,
6,7,"I can't fit all my booksin my locker.
"
,,
6,7,"Can I put the rest of them
"
,,
6,7,"on your giant enormous ass?
"
,,
6,7,"Hey, Connie, hi.
"
,,
6,7,"Peter Griffin,Meg's father.
"
,,
6,7,"Say, uh, can you do me a favor?
"
,,
6,7,"You see that
"
,,
6,7,"fire extinguisher there?
"
,,
6,7,"Dad, that'senough!
"
,,
6,7,"Dad, that's enough!
"
,,
6,7,"That'senough, Dad!
"
,,
6,7,"I just want youto know, Meg,
"
,,
6,7,"if there's anythingyou ever want,
"
,,
6,7," all you got to do is ask.
"
,,
6,7," Really?
"
,,
6,7,"Well, there kind ofis one thing.
"
,,
6,7,"There he is now!
"
,,
6,7,"Hey, Meg.You ready to go?
"
,,
6,7,"Dad, you remember MichaelMilano,
"
,,
6,7,"from the hospital.
"
,,
6,7,"He's my date.
"
,,
6,7,"Say, Michael, can you do me a favor?
"
,,
6,7,"You see that
"
,,
6,7,"fire extinguisher there?
"
,,
6,7,"Stay away from my daughter,
"
,,
6,7,"you possible rapist.
"
,,
6,7,"Dad, stop it.
"
,,
6,7,"Michael's my date.
"
,,
6,7,"Meg, I almost lost you once,
"
,,
6,7,"I'm not gonnalose you again.
"
,,
6,7,"This guy may look harmless
"
,,
6,7,"on the outside,
"
,,
6,7,"but on the inside he could
"
,,
6,7,"be a complete bastard,
"
,,
6,7,"like Fred Flintstone.
"
,,
6,7,"So, why exactly do
"
,,
6,7,"you want this separation?
"
,,
6,7,"Well, Mr. Stoneberg, in a nutshell,
"
,,
6,7,"the cat put me outside,
"
,,
6,7,"I was bangin' on the door for like
"
,,
6,7,"I didn't hear you.
"
,,
6,7,"Oh, there's no way
"
,,
6,7,"you didn't hear me.
"
,,
6,7,"I was in the shower.
"
,,
6,7,"Oh, she was in the shower.
"
,,
6,7,"The elephant's trunkwas on full blast.
"
,,
6,7,"I couldn't hear you.
"
,,
6,7," And besides, you're always
"
,,
6,7," All you do is spend my money
"
,,
6,7," on expensive clothesand hairdos.
"
,,
6,7," when to pay attention?
"
,,
6,7,"But when I want to get my rocksoff,
"
,,
6,7,"you're nowhere to be found
"
,,
6,7,"you passive-aggressive bitch.
"
,,
6,7,"Meg, can I talk to you
"
,,
6,7,"in the kitchen, please?
"
,,
6,7,"Dad, what the hell?
"
,,
6,7,"Lois, did you know
"
,,
6,7,"that Meg had a date?
"
,,
6,7,"Yes. With that nice boy
"
,,
6,7,"from the hospital.
"
,,
6,7," What's the matter?
"
,,
6,7," We don't know him.
"
,,
6,7,"Maybe he's not even a boy.
"
,,
6,7,"Maybe he's two dwarves in an overcoat
"
,,
6,7,"wanting to see what sex
"
,,
6,7,"is like with a big person.
"
,,
6,7,"Is that what you want?
"
,,
6,7,"Two crafty dwarves in your house,
"
,,
6,7,"after your daughter--
"
,,
6,7,"wait, do dwarves grant wishes?
"
,,
6,7,"No, Peter, they're people,
"
,,
6,7,"like you and me.
"
,,
6,7,"Well, good-bye phonein the bathroom,
"
,,
6,7,"but I still don't like Meg
"
,,
6,7,"dating that boy.
"
,,
6,7,"Guy-guy-guy's that age,
"
,,
6,7,"all they care about is
"
,,
6,7,"putting their thing in everything.
"
,,
6,7,"I'm not gonna let Meg turn out like
"
,,
6,7,"my Nerf football in the hall closet.
"
,,
6,7,"Dad, didn't you say you'd give me
"
,,
6,7,"whatever I wanted?
"
,,
6,7,"Well, I want to go out with Michael.
"
,,
6,7,"Peter, you're being overprotective.
"
,,
6,7,"Look, why don't youjust talk to him?
"
,,
6,7,"You might find outhe's not so bad.
"
,,
6,7,"All right, Lois, but
"
,,
6,7,"I know what my gut tells me.
"
,,
6,7,"And right now
"
,,
6,7,"it's telling me I have...
"
,,
6,7,"Indigestion.
"
,,
6,7,"But I'll suck it up and talk Michael.
"
,,
6,7,"en though I've also go...
"
,,
6,7,"Diarrhea.
"
,,
6,7,"So, you are here
"
,,
6,7,"to take out my daughter.
"
,,
6,7,"What are your intentions?
"
,,
6,7,"I just think Meg is really cool,
"
,,
6,7,"and I want to get to know her better.
"
,,
6,7,"You know, Michael,my daughter's womb
"
,,
6,7,"is not a wild firefor you to douse
"
,,
6,7,"with your adolescent seed.
"
,,
6,7," I understand.
"
,,
6,7," Do you, Michael? Do you?
"
,,
6,7,"We'll see.
"
,,
6,7,"Let me ask you a question.
"
,,
6,7,"You ever sit on your arm
"
,,
6,7,"till it falls asleep,
"
,,
6,7,"and then play with yourself and
"
,,
6,7,"pretend like somebody else is doing it?
"
,,
6,7,"Honestly... yes.
"
,,
6,7,"Not anymore you don't.
"
,,
6,7,"'Cause you're going out
"
,,
6,7,"with my daughter.
"
,,
6,7,"Morning, Brian.
"
,,
6,7,"Here, put this on.
"
,,
6,7," How long have you been here?
"
,,
6,7," 7:00 a.m.
"
,,
6,7,"All right, here's your hammer, here's your walkie,
"
,,
6,7,"and here's your stud finder.
"
,,
6,7,"Oh. Oh, well, it's working.
"
,,
6,7,"All right, joke time is over.
"
,,
6,7,"Work time has begun.
"
,,
6,7,"You get started with this dry wall
"
,,
6,7,"and I'm gonna start pulling out
"
,,
6,7,"those old floorboards in the kitchen.
"
,,
6,7,"Hey, Brian, knock, knock.
"
,,
6,7,"Who's there?
"
,,
6,7,"Two friends building
"
,,
6,7,"a house together.
"
,,
6,7,"Hey, Meg, I, uh, got you something
"
,,
6,7,"for our three-week anniversary.
"
,,
6,7,"Wow, a Maroon 5 CD.
"
,,
6,7,"Yeah, I remember how you told me
"
,,
6,7,"you liked terrible music,
"
,,
6,7," so I thought you might appreciate it.
"
,,
6,7," You're so thoughtful.
"
,,
6,7," Wh-what the hell?
"
,,
6,7," What's wrong?
"
,,
6,7,"Uh, Meg, I'm not sure,
"
,,
6,7,"but I think
"
,,
6,7,"dad is sitting at
"
,,
6,7,"that table over there.
"
,,
6,7,"What? Where?
"
,,
6,7,"Well, I-I can't tell if it's him.
"
,,
6,7,"I think he's wearing
"
,,
6,7,"some kind of disguise.
"
,,
6,7,"Oh, my God, Dad.
"
,,
6,7," What do you think you're doing?
"
,,
6,7," Peter? Who Peter?
"
,,
6,7,"I didn't say ""Peter."" I said ""Dad.""
"
,,
6,7,"Have you been spying on us
"
,,
6,7,"the entire time we've been dating?
"
,,
6,7,"Meg, it's only because I want
"
,,
6,7,"to make sure this guy
"
,,
6,7,"treats you right and
"
,,
6,7,"doesn't try anything funny.
"
,,
6,7,"Meg, this is more than
"
,,
6,7,"I can deal with.
"
,,
6,7,"If your father is this opposed
"
,,
6,7,"to our relationship,
"
,,
6,7,"I don't see
"
,,
6,7,"how it can work out.
"
,,
6,7," But, Michael...
"
,,
6,7," I'm sorry, Meg.
"
,,
6,7,"I promise I won't forget you.
"
,,
6,7,"See, look, Meg, he just walked out
"
,,
6,7,"on you. He's a bad man.
"
,,
6,7,"Like Jodie Foster.
"
,,
6,7,"Oh, no, Jodie! It's my husband!
"
,,
6,7,"He's home from work early!
"
,,
6,7,"Don't worry, baby.
"
,,
6,7,"He had to findout sometime.
"
,,
6,7,"All right, Brian, I'm going to go up
"
,,
6,7,"to the upper level
"
,,
6,7,"and run this wire
"
,,
6,7,"down through the wall.
"
,,
6,7,"Grab your walky
"
,,
6,7,"I'll call you when I get up there.
"
,,
6,7," What?</i>
"
,,
6,7,"when you've finished talking. Over.</i>
"
,,
6,7,"What? Over.
"
,,
6,7," No.</i>
"
,,
6,7,"No. Over.
"
,,
6,7,"feeding it through. Over.</i>
"
,,
6,7,"Wait, if you haven't started feeding it,
"
,,
6,7,"why'd you ask me if I could see it?
"
,,
6,7,"I said why'd you ask
"
,,
6,7,"me if I could see it,
"
,,
6,7,"if you haven't started
"
,,
6,7,"feeding it? Over.
"
,,
6,7,"I can hear you now. Over.</i>
"
,,
6,7,"You know,you're a jackass.
"
,,
6,7,"For the record, I don't want to
"
,,
6,7,"hang out with you anymore
"
,,
6,7,"when this is over.
"
,,
6,7,"Over.</i>
"
,,
6,7,"I said I don't want to hang out
"
,,
6,7,"with you anymore
"
,,
6,7," When this is what?</i>
"
,,
6,7,"your sentence. Over.</i>
"
,,
6,7,"That's it. My sentence is over.
"
,,
6,7,"Over.</i>
"
,,
6,7,"My sentence is...
"
,,
6,7,"Wait a minute. I have to say ""over""
"
,,
6,7,"even if the sentence ends
"
,,
6,7,"with the word ""over""?
"
,,
6,7,"Over.</i>
"
,,
6,7," You see the wire what? Over.</i>
"
,,
6,7,"Over!
"
,,
6,7,"is brought to you by Sanka.</i>
"
,,
6,7,"Don't yawant a, want a Sanka?
"
,,
6,7,"It doesn't keep me up at night,
"
,,
6,7,"but it helps me poo!
"
,,
6,7,"Meg, sweetie, it's been,like, two
"
,,
6,7,"Don't you think it's time
"
,,
6,7,"to forget about that boy?
"
,,
6,7,"Yeah, Meg, he was a bum anyway.
"
,,
6,7,"You'll find another fellow.
"
,,
6,7,"I could set you up
"
,,
6,7,"with one of my friends.
"
,,
6,7,"Oh wait... I don't have any friends.
"
,,
6,7,"I could set you up with Dad.
"
,,
6,7,"Dad, would you be
"
,,
6,7,"interested in dating Meg?
"
,,
6,7,"I certainly would.
"
,,
6,7,"There, Meg,everything's fine.
"
,,
6,7," It's not Michael I'm upset about!
"
,,
6,7," Well, what is it then?
"
,,
6,7,"I'm pregnant!
"
,,
6,7,"Dad, I swear to God
"
,,
6,7,"I didn't know that
"
,,
6,7,"when I set you up with her.
"
,,
6,7,"Oh, I can't believe this!
"
,,
6,7,"My baby's pregnant!
"
,,
6,7," How could this happen?
"
,,
6,7," I don't know.
"
,,
6,7,"But regardless of how it happened,
"
,,
6,7,"it happened.
"
,,
6,7,"You're pregnant, Meg,
"
,,
6,7,"and there's only one thing to do.
"
,,
6,7,"Meg, can you turn over?
"
,,
6,7,"I gotta get that thing out of there.
"
,,
6,7,"You're sitting on my shirt;
"
,,
6,7,"I gotta put it on this hanger.
"
,,
6,7,"Now I'm going to Michael's house
"
,,
6,7,"to force himto marry you.
"
,,
6,7,"Dad, please don't do this!
"
,,
6,7," You can't make him marry me!
"
,,
6,7," I just want to talk to him.
"
,,
6,7,"Why do you have a shotgun?
"
,,
6,7,"I just wantto talk to him.
"
,,
6,7," Dad, this is ridiculous!
"
,,
6,7," I just want to talk to him.
"
,,
6,7," I just want totalk to him.
"
,,
6,7," It is not his fault!
"
,,
6,7," I just want to shoot him.
"
,,
6,7," You can't shoot him!
"
,,
6,7,"Wait, what... what are you doing?
"
,,
6,7,"You got my Meg pregnant!
"
,,
6,7,"What?!
"
,,
6,7,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
6,7,"Meg! Why didn't you tell me?
"
,,
6,7,"I didn't think you wanted
"
,,
6,7,"to see me.
"
,,
6,7,"But this changes everything.
"
,,
6,7,"I want to be there for you, Meg.
"
,,
6,7,"I love you.
"
,,
6,7,"Will you marry me?
"
,,
6,7,"Yes!
"
,,
6,7,"Of course!
"
,,
6,7,"Ah, now see?
"
,,
6,7,"That's an even more beautiful sight
"
,,
6,7,"than 72 virgins waiting in heaven
"
,,
6,7,"for a suicide bomber.
"
,,
6,7,"Here I am!
"
,,
6,7,"We're playing Magic: The Gathering.
"
,,
6,7,"Want to join?
"
,,
6,7,"Osama!
"
,,
6,7," You know something, Brian?
"
,,
6,7," Yeah?
"
,,
6,7,"I'm starting to think maybe
"
,,
6,7,"we bit off a little more
"
,,
6,7,"than we could chew.
"
,,
6,7,"Yeah.
"
,,
6,7,"Well, we're in it and
"
,,
6,7,"we're going to finish the job.
"
,,
6,7,"Should we get started
"
,,
6,7,"on the upper level?
"
,,
6,7,"No.
"
,,
6,7,"What the hell are we gonna do?
"
,,
6,7,"We've sunk all of our money
"
,,
6,7,"into this place.
"
,,
6,7,"I've, um... I've got an idea.
"
,,
6,7,"I'll be right back.
"
,,
6,7,"So, listen, we're going to want
"
,,
6,7,"to be leaving now.
"
,,
6,7,"Why ?
"
,,
6,7,"Because I just emptied a full tank
"
,,
6,7,"of gasoline and lit a match.
"
,,
6,7,"We've got about five seconds.
"
,,
6,7,"Didn't we have an electrician
"
,,
6,7,"in there today?
"
,,
6,7,"He left. Pretty sure he left.
"
,,
6,7,"Isn't that his truck?
"
,,
6,7,"Well, by God, Brian,
"
,,
6,7,"we're murderers.
"
,,
6,7,"I guess this means you'll
"
,,
6,7,"be going to doggie hell.
"
,,
6,7,"Hey, what do you guys
"
,,
6,7,"think of this one?
"
,,
6,7,"Meg, are you sure you want
"
,,
6,7,"to go through with this?
"
,,
6,7,"You know, there are other options.
"
,,
6,7,"Mom, I'm not getting an abortion!
"
,,
6,7,"I'm not saying an abortion,
"
,,
6,7,"per se,
"
,,
6,7,"maybe you just drink
"
,,
6,7,"and smoke a lot.
"
,,
6,7,"What ?!
"
,,
6,7,"Just don't stop doing it
"
,,
6,7,"and then chicken out
"
,,
6,7,"halfway through the pregnancy,
"
,,
6,7,"because then
"
,,
6,7,"you'll wind up with Chris.
"
,,
6,7,"Well, Lois, I got the cake.
"
,,
6,7,"Oh, and they were all out
"
,,
6,7,"of the bride and groom figurines,
"
,,
6,7,"so I got the Iron Giant
"
,,
6,7,"and a courtroom doll
"
,,
6,7,"that kids use to show where
"
,,
6,7,"the molester touched them.
"
,,
6,7,"All right, Meg, enjoy your
"
,,
6,7,"bachelorette party.
"
,,
6,7,"I'm out of here
"
,,
6,7,"'cause I don't need to see
"
,,
6,7,"what you crazy girls
"
,,
6,7,"are going to do while I'm gone.
"
,,
6,7,"But just remember, this is a residence
"
,,
6,7,"and should be treated as such.
"
,,
6,7,"And if you girls drink anything,
"
,,
6,7,"there's recycling under
"
,,
6,7,"the sink in the kitchen.
"
,,
6,7,"Okay, have fun.
"
,,
6,7,"So... what are we supposed to do?
"
,,
6,7,"Yeah, this doesn't seem like
"
,,
6,7,"much of a party.
"
,,
6,7,"Hey, what's with all the noise?
"
,,
6,7,"Got some complaints
"
,,
6,7,"from next door.
"
,,
6,7,"I might have to take you girls...
"
,,
6,7,"downtown.
"
,,
6,7,"Which one of you is the lucky bride?
"
,,
6,7," What's your name, sweetie?
"
,,
6,7," Dad, you know my name.
"
,,
6,7,"It's Officer Nasty.
"
,,
6,7,"Careful, I might be carrying
"
,,
6,7,"a concealed weapon.
"
,,
6,7," Hello.
"
,,
6,7," Hi. Name, please?
"
,,
6,7," Neil Goldman.
"
,,
6,7," Goldman, Goldman...
"
,,
6,7," Sorry, no Neil Goldman.
"
,,
6,7," Oh, I beg your pardon.
"
,,
6,7,"I meant to say Chris Griffin.
"
,,
6,7,"Griffin, Griffin... Oh! here it is.
"
,,
6,7,"Says you're supposed to be an usher.
"
,,
6,7,"Well, you need this.
"
,,
6,7," Name, please?
"
,,
6,7," Chris Griffin.
"
,,
6,7,"Griffin, Griffin, hmm.
"
,,
6,7,"I'm sorry, sir, Chris Griffin
"
,,
6,7,"has already checked in.
"
,,
6,7,"Well, that's impossible!
"
,,
6,7,"Meg, are you ready?
"
,,
6,7,"Sweetie, what's wrong?
"
,,
6,7,"Mom, I can't do it.
"
,,
6,7,"I can't get married.
"
,,
6,7,"What?! Well, why not?
"
,,
6,7,"Because...
"
,,
6,7,"I'm not pregnant.
"
,,
6,7,"What do you mean?
"
,,
6,7,"How do you know?
"
,,
6,7,"I got my period.
"
,,
6,7,"I must've read the test wrong.
"
,,
6,7,"What am I going to do?
"
,,
6,7,"Michael's out there waiting for me.
"
,,
6,7,"Well, Meg, the best thing
"
,,
6,7,"you can do is be honest.
"
,,
6,7,"Just tell Michael the truth.
"
,,
6,7,"If he cares about you,
"
,,
6,7,"he'll understand.
"
,,
6,7,"I'll try.
"
,,
6,7,"Thanks, Mom.
"
,,
6,7," I love you.
"
,,
6,7," I... you too, honey.
"
,,
6,7,"God, look at Meg's fat shoulders
"
,,
6,7,"in those spaghetti straps!
"
,,
6,7,"It's like bread baking
"
,,
6,7,"around twine.
"
,,
6,7," Meg... you look beautiful.
"
,,
6,7," Thank you , Michael.
"
,,
6,7,"I have never been more in love
"
,,
6,7,"with someone than I am
"
,,
6,7,"with you right now.
"
,,
6,7,"Oh, Michael, I love you, too.
"
,,
6,7,"And I have some wonderful news:
"
,,
6,7," I'm not pregnant.
"
,,
6,7," What?!
"
,,
6,7,"Dad, I'm sorry about
"
,,
6,7,"this whole mess.
"
,,
6,7,"You know what, Meg?
"
,,
6,7,"It's all my fault.
"
,,
6,7,"I never should've dragged
"
,,
6,7,"you into this, anyway.
"
,,
6,7,"I guess sometimes a father
"
,,
6,7,"just gets a little over
"
,,
6,7,"protective of his daughter, but
"
,,
6,7,"you got to know I was only thinking
"
,,
6,7,"about your happiness.
"
,,
6,7,"I know, Dad.
"
,,
6,7,"And I appreciate it.
"
,,
6,7,"The problem now is that

"
,,
6,8,"He's collecting Cleveland's
"
,,
6,8,"mail while he's out of town.
"
,,
6,8,"Black guy mail.
"
,,
6,8,"Peter, you're just supposed
"
,,
6,8,"to pick up Cleveland's mail,
"
,,
6,8,"not go through it.
"
,,
6,8,"Lois, black people are
"
,,
6,8,"different than you and I.
"
,,
6,8,"And me, I find
"
,,
6,8,"that hilarious.
"
,,
6,8,"Boy, Cleveland gets
"
,,
6,8,"a lot of magazines.
"
,,
6,8,"Grape Soda Today.
"
,,
6,8,"Orange Soda Quarterly.

"
,,
6,8,"Hey, what you got
"
,,
6,8,"there, Stewie?
"
,,
6,8,"Ooh, Mustache Aficionado.
"
,,
6,8,"Wow, look at these men.
"
,,
6,8,"What class, what grace.
"
,,
6,8,"And all because
"
,,
6,8,"of a little upper lip hair.
"
,,
6,8,"Lois,
"
,,
6,8,"I am going grow a mustache.
"
,,
6,8,"Then I'll have it made
"
,,
6,8,"like the Monopoly guy.
"
,,
6,8,"Except when he goes
"
,,
6,8,"directly to jail.
"
,,
6,8,"I wish I could tell you
"
,,
6,8,"that the Monopoly guy
"
,,
6,8,"fought the good fight
"
,,
6,8,"and the Sisters let him be.
"
,,
6,8,"I wish I could tell you that.
"
,,
6,8,"But prison is no
"
,,
6,8,"fairy-tale world.
"
,,
6,8,"Hey, Rupert,
"
,,
6,8,"what if the refrigerator
"
,,
6,8,"was a monster that
"
,,
6,8,"talked like this?
"
,,
6,8,"I am a monster.
"
,,
6,8,"I am going to bite
"
,,
6,8,"your fingers.
"
,,
6,8,"Here I come.
"
,,
6,8,"I'm going to get you.
"
,,
6,8,"Ah! I don't want to play anymore
"
,,
6,8,"Normal voice, normal voice!
"
,,
6,8,"The refrigerator can't hurt me.
"
,,
6,8,"Okay?
"
,,
6,8,"Oh, my God, Dad,
"
,,
6,8,"what's on your face?
"
,,
6,8,"It's a mustache, Meg.
"
,,
6,8,"Oh, I think it's sexy.
"
,,
6,8,"I think it's gay.
"
,,
6,8,"It's not gay, Brian.
"
,,
6,8,"If I'm gay, then
"
,,
6,8,"Freddie Mercury was gay.
"
,,
6,8,"Freddie Mercury
"
,,
6,8,"the lead singer of Queen?
"
,,
6,8,"He was incredibly gay.
"
,,
6,8,"He was not!
"
,,
6,8,"He had a mustache
"
,,
6,8,"which is praal like wedding ring
"
,,
6,8,"I imagine you're going to be
"
,,
6,8,"much more of a stern father,
"
,,
6,8,"now that you have a mustache.
"
,,
6,8,"Well, Chris, there may bemore lap sitting
"
,,
6,8,"than there'sn.
"
,,
6,8,"And I might answer most of
"
,,
6,8,"your questions with a story.
"
,,
6,8,"But, mostly,my mustache tells people
"
,,
6,8,"that there is a 90% chance
"
,,
6,8,"that I am poorly educated,
"
,,
6,8,"that I keep upscale pornziou the open
"
,,
6,8,"and that I listen tothe Little River Band
"
,,
6,8,"with giant headphones.
"
,,
6,8,"Ugh! That's the ugliest thing the Fatman's grown
"
,,
6,8,"since that horse leg.
"
,,
6,8,"Hey, Peter, have you seen my...
"
,,
6,8,"Aw, Brian, I'm sorry, but what do I keep saying?
"
,,
6,8,"Do not stand behin me.
"
,,
6,8,"Because I will get scared.
"
,,
6,8,"And now back to One Tree Hill.
"

"
,,
6,8,"Really?What's it like?
"
,,
6,8,"'Cause I haveno idea.
"
,,
6,8,"Well, uh, I supposeif you imagine it
"
,,
6,8,"like a parking spacethat you think,
"
,,
6,8,"""Gosh, there's no way
"
,,
6,8,"I'm gonna be ableto fit in there.""
"
,,
6,8,"But then you fold inthe sideview mirrors and
"
,,
6,8,"sure enough,well, look at that.
"
,,
6,8,"Well, in that scenario,
"
,,
6,8,"it sounds like I'd rather be
"
,,
6,8,"the parking spacethan the car.
"
,,
6,8,"Yeah, that's whatI've always guessed.
"
,,
6,8,"I hate being all strokey.
"
,,
6,8,"This is all your fault,McBurgertown.
"
,,
6,8,"You and your delicioushamburgers!
"
,,
6,8,"I swearI'll get back at you someday
"
,,
6,8,"for what you did to meand what you did to Wimpy.
"
,,
6,8,"I would gladlypay you Tuesday
"
,,
6,8,"for a hamburger today.
"
,,
6,8,"If only there were some way
"
,,
6,8,"I could belike everybody else again.
"
,,
6,8,"How long was I in there?
"
,,
6,8,"About five minutes.
"
,,
6,8,"Why are we notfunding this?
"
,,
6,8,"Sweetheart, that's incredible.
"
,,
6,8,"And it only took five minutes?
"
,,
6,8,"Five minutes.I went in there
"
,,
6,8,"they injected me
"
,,
6,8,"with a little bitof that fetal crap,and bam
"
,,
6,8,"good ol'gambling man Peter.
"
,,
6,8,"And now I can
"
,,
6,8,"take my revengeon McBurger Town.
"
,,
6,8,"Wait. What?
"
,,
6,8,"It's their fault
"
,,
6,8,"I had a stroke, Brian.
"
,,
6,8,"And I'm gonna sue 'em for it.
"
,,
6,8,"Peter, you ate 30 hamburgers.
"
,,
6,8,"It was your own fault.
"
,,
6,8,"Yeah, besides, Peter,
"
,,
6,8,"those companies have
"
,,
6,8,"huge legal divisions.
"
,,
6,8,"You can't fight that.
"
,,
6,8,"I'll find a way with the help
"
,,
6,8,"of my snarky cat lawyer
"
,,
6,8,"Meowsy McDermott.
"
,,
6,8,"You've got to be kitten me!
"
,,
6,8,"Ha!
"
,,
6,8,"This court finds in
"
,,
6,8,"favor of the defendant,
"
,,
6,8,"McBurgertown Industries.
"
,,
6,8,"What?! Hey, come on!
"
,,
6,8,"That's not fair!
"
,,
6,8,"Mr. Griffin, what did you expect?
"
,,
6,8,"They have a hundred lawyers,
"
,,
6,8,"and you tried to bribe me
"
,,
6,8,"with a subscription to Grape Soda Today
"
,,
6,8,"which I already have.
"
,,
6,8,"Case dismissed.
"
,,
6,8,"What did I tell you, Peter?
"
,,
6,8,"One man can't take on a
"
,,
6,8,"multinational fast food conglomerate.
"
,,
6,8,"Oh, yes, I can.
"
,,
6,8,"This ain't over, Brian.
"
,,
6,8,"Those people are bad and
"
,,
6,8,"I'm gonna prove it to the world.
"
,,
6,8,"How do you expect to do that?
"
,,
6,8,"Are you kidding?
"
,,
6,8,"I've tackled tougher jobs before.
"
,,
6,8,"Remember that time I was Robin
"
,,
6,8,"Williams' jumping-off point?
"
,,
6,8," Okay... religion.

6,8," Oh, religion.
"
,,
6,8,"You kill me, I kill you,
"
,,
6,8,"we both go to heaven.
"
,,
6,8,"You might have to help me out
"
,,
6,8,"with the last ten or so
"
,,
6,8,"because Mr. Happy
"
,,
6,8,"gets tired- religion.
"
,,
6,8,"Politics.
"
,,
6,8,"Well, we're gonna come down there
"
,,
6,8,"and take all your oil.
"
,,
6,8,"But this is our oil.
"
,,
6,8,"Yee-haw!
"
,,
6,8,"Well, here's my missile.
"
,,
6,8,"Okay, take it, take it.
"
,,
6,8,"Politics.
"
,,
6,8,"Uh, you know what?
"
,,
6,8,"I'm gonna take a
"
,,
6,8,"five-minute break.
"
,,
6,8,"Huh, five-minute break.
"
,,
6,8,"What are you,
"
,,
6,8,"a construction worker?
"
,,
6,8,"Hey, baby, I'm not gay.
"
,,
6,8,"Does this yellow hat make
"
,,
6,8,"my ass look fat?
"
,,
6,8,"Five-minute break.
"
,,
6,8,"You enjoyed the movie, baby?
"
,,
6,8,"Yeah, but I think I'm gonna
"
,,
6,8,"enjoy this even more.
"
,,
6,8,"Ugh! No, thanks.
"
,,
6,8,"I am stuffed.
"
,,
6,8,"So, we just gonna sit here and talk
"
,,
6,8,"or are we gonna do it?
"
,,
6,8,"All right, baby,
"
,,
6,8,"those are the magic words.
"
,,
6,8,"Now check this out!
"
,,
6,8,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
6,8,"Yeah, I am ready for sex.
"
,,
6,8,"I drank eight gallons
"
,,
6,8,"of water today.
"
,,
6,8,"This baby's ready to explode.
"
,,
6,8,"Is..
"
,,
6,8,"is there more underneath
"
,,
6,8,"of is that it?
"
,,
6,8,"I'm sorry?
"
,,
6,8,"Zac, just get the hel
"
,,
6,8,"lout of my car.
"
,,
6,8,"That's it?
"
,,
6,8,"That was sex?
"
,,
6,8,"What a rip-off.
"
,,
6,8,"I should sue her.
"
,,
6,8,"Be careful you're not held
"
,,
6,8,"in contempt of cat.
"
,,
6,8,"Pardon me.
"
,,
6,8,"We're two Asian businessmen
"
,,
6,8,"looking to invest
"
,,
6,8,"in McBurgertown Industries
"
,,
6,8,"and we'd like a tour of your facility.
"
,,
6,8,"You don't look Asian.
"
,,
6,8,"Well, I guess we'll just take
"
,,
6,8,"our millions of Dongs elsewhere.
"
,,
6,8,"Wait, wait!
"
,,
6,8,"Let me get our
"
,,
6,8,"general manager.
"
,,
6,8,"Peter, what the hell do you
"
,,
6,8,"expect to accomplish here?
"
,,
6,8,"Evidence, Brian.
"
,,
6,8,"I'm gonna find just
"
,,
6,8,"the right piece
"
,,
6,8,"of incriminating evidence to
"
,,
6,8,"bring down this company.
"
,,
6,8,"Over here is a menu from our first
"
,,
6,8,"McBurgertown restaurant in 1952.
"
,,
6,8,"At that time, our value meal
"
,,
6,8,"consisted of a hamburger,
"
,,
6,8,"a cup of coffee and a Lucky Strike.
"
,,
6,8,"Wow. How much did all that cost?
"
,,
6,8,"Back in the '50s,
"
,,
6,8,"one straw penny.
"
,,
6,8," A whole strawpenny?
"
,,
6,8," Indeed. Follow me.
"
,,
6,8,"Hey, what's in there?
"
,,
6,8,"Oh, I'm sorry.
"
,,
6,8,"That's off limit.
"
,,
6,8,"Now if you'll excuse me for a second,
"
,,
6,8,"I have to go to the bathroom
"
,,
6,8,"for about 30 minutes
"
,,
6,8,"as I eat a lot of meat.
"
,,
6,8,"Please give me your word that
"
,,
6,8,"you won't go in that door.
"
,,
6,8,"Okay.
"
,,
6,8,"Good.
"
,,
6,8,"See you in a half hour.
"
,,
6,8,"Peter, this is your chance!
"
,,
6,8,"Brian, I gave him my word.
"
,,
6,8,"The hell with that.
"
,,
6,8,"Let's see what's behind this door.
"
,,
6,8,"My God, what is this?!
"
,,
6,8,"This must be the
"
,,
6,8,"McBurgertown slaughterhouse.
"
,,
6,8,"Sir, you are correct.
"
,,
6,8,"But in here, we call it ""DaCow.""
"
,,
6,8," DaCow?
"
,,
6,8," DaCow.
"
,,
6,8,"Except we spell the
"
,,
6,8,"""chau"" part C-O-W,
"
,,
6,8,"Like ""cow,"" so it's
"
,,
6,8,"kind of a... eh, sort of a dark joke.
"
,,
6,8,"Yeah, yeah, it's a Holocaust joke.
"
,,
6,8,"That's, that's really funny.
"
,,
6,8,"Unfortunately, life in a
"
,,
6,8,"slaughterhouse is no laughing matter.
"
,,
6,8,"They have killed a great many of us,
"
,,
6,8,"including my beloved wife.
"
,,
6,8,"Peter, this is it.
"
,,
6,8,"This is the evidence
"
,,
6,8,"you've been looking for.
"
,,
6,8,"If we can get you out of here,
"
,,
6,8,"would you be willing to testify
"
,,
6,8,"publicly about these atrocities?
"
,,
6,8,"Oh, absolutely.
"
,,
6,8,"But how do you intend to escape?
"
,,
6,8,"You leave that to us.
"
,,
6,8,"Come on.
"
,,
6,8,"Hey!
"
,,
6,8,"There they are!
"
,,
6,8,"After them!
"
,,
6,8,"Hey, hey, what's up, Lucas?
"
,,
6,8,"What the hell's your problem?
"
,,
6,8,"Hey, Logan, what's going on?
"
,,
6,8,"What the hell is going on here?
"
,,
6,8,"Nothing, baby penis.
"
,,
6,8,"Well, yes, I have a baby-
"
,,
6,8,"Well, for your information,
"
,,
6,8,"I don't want a big penis.
"
,,
6,8,"I think they're messy.
"
,,
6,8,"Well, you've effectively ended
"
,,
6,8,"my reign of coolness,
"
,,
6,8,"haven't you?
"
,,
6,8,"You're a disgrace,
"
,,
6,8,"you know that?
"
,,
6,8,"Hey, you're the one
"
,,
6,8,"with the tiny penis.
"
,,
6,8,"You know, Connie, look,
"
,,
6,8,"you're right.
"
,,
6,8,"I behaved like a fool.
"
,,
6,8,"And I apologize.
"
,,
6,8,"But, before I go,
"
,,
6,8,"could I maybe have one last kiss?
"
,,
6,8,"Well, I guess so.
"
,,
6,8,"Look, this girl
"
,,
6,8,"is making out with a baby!
"
,,
6,8,"A nude baby!
"
,,
6,8,"Hey!
"
,,
6,8,"That's right.
"
,,
6,8,"To hell with you all!
"
,,
6,8,"I am who I am.

,,

"
,,
6,8,"Quiet, everybody, this is it.
"
,,
6,8,"The McBurgertown
"
,,
6,8,"franchise suffered
"
,,
6,8,"a publicity setback today
"
,,
6,8,"from which it may not recover,
"
,,
6,8,"thanks to testimony regarding
"
,,
6,8,"its practices by a very brave cow.
"
,,
6,8,"I have revealed to you,
"
,,
6,8,"today, these horrors
"
,,
6,8,"in the hope that you will
"
,,
6,8,"see the need for change.
"
,,
6,8,"But always remember what
"
,,
6,8,"I have done here today
"
,,
6,8,"is not a courageous act.
"
,,
6,8,"The courage lies with a
"
,,
6,8,"man who has the guts
"
,,
6,8,"to say no to a fast food restaurant
"
,,
6,8,"and eat a salad instead.
"
,,
6,8,"To say, ""I will eat
"
,,
6,8,"this salad with pride.
"
,,
6,8,"I don't care if I look
"
,,
6,8,"like a gay person.""
"
,,
6,8,"So to all of you
"
,,
6,8,"salad-eating homosexuals,
"
,,
6,8,"I say thank you.
"
,,
6,8,"And thank you, Peter,
"
,,
6,8,"for all you've done
"
,,
6,8,"to help expose
"
,,
6,8,"this grave injustice.
"
,,
6,8,"Where will you go now,
"
,,
6,8,"Mr. Cow?
"
,,
6,8,"I cannot stay here?
"
,,
6,8,"Peter said I could stay here.
"
,,
6,8,"Oh... gosh...yeah, I don't,
"
,,
6,8,"I don't really see how
"
,,
6,8,"that's gonna work out.
"
,,
6,8,"Oh. Well, as I said,
"
,,
6,8,"Peter just promised...
"
,,
6,8,"Yeah, I should stop you there.
"
,,
6,8,"I didn't really promise anything.
"
,,
6,8,"I just said ""Maybe, if it was okay with Lois.""
"
,,
6,8,"Boy, it just it seems like
"
,,
6,8,"a real burden to me.
"
,,
6,8,"Well, this is pretty awkward.
"
,,
6,8,"Ciaoooooo...
"
,,
6,8,"Synch: Athana e koalinux
"
,,
6,9,"Lois, look at this.
"
,,
6,9,"My essay won first prize
"
,,
6,9,"in the New England
"
,,
6,9,"'Rising Writers' contest.
"
,,
6,9,"I'm going to be honoured
"
,,
6,9,"with a big ceremony
"
,,
6,9,"in Martha's Vineyard.
"
,,
6,9,"they are going to put me up in luxury
"
,,
6,9,"hotel, all expenses paid.
"
,,
6,9,"Wow!
"
,,
6,9,"Congratulations, Brian.
"
,,
6,9,"Meg, please,
"
,,
6,9,"I'm talking.
"
,,
6,9,"Over a thousand people entered
"
,,
6,9,"the contest and they chose mine.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, that's
"
,,
6,9,"wonderful, Brian.
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah, that's
"
,,
6,9,"a great achievement.
"
,,
6,9,"Just like the first
"
,,
6,9,"chemotherapy patient
"
,,
6,9,"to figure out
"
,,
6,9,"the handkerchief look.
"
,,
6,9,"Honey, get in here!
"
,,
6,9,"What is it?
"
,,
6,9,"Just... just get in here!
"
,,
6,9,"What...?
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, my God.
"
,,
6,9,"Right.
"
,,
6,9,"It's like you...
"
,,
6,9,"Don't even have cancer!
"
,,
6,9," I know.
"
,,
6,9," Oh, my God.
"
,,
6,9,"No, but I still have
"
,,
6,9,"pretty aggressive cancer.
"
,,
6,9,"Come on, Peter.
"
,,
6,9,"We're gonna be late for lunch
"
,,
6,9,"with Mom and Dad.
"
,,
6,9,"Oh. Right.
"
,,
6,9,"You didn't forget,
"
,,
6,9,"did you?
"
,,
6,9,"No, no, I didn't forget.
"
,,
6,9,"Let me just go change
"
,,
6,9,"out of this fishing gear.
"
,,
6,9,"Hey, Peter, what's up?
"
,,
6,9,"Come on, come on,
"
,,
6,9,"we got to go now.
"
,,
6,9,"We got to go now.
"
,,
6,9,"Come on, Joe! Joe! Quagmire!
"
,,
6,9,"Come on.
"
,,
6,9,"Go, go, go, go, go!
"
,,
6,9,"Pull the car around.
"
,,
6,9,"Come on, let's go.
"
,,
6,9,"Hello?
"
,,
6,9,"Lois, this is Peter.
"
,,
6,9,"I'm afraid that on my way
"
,,
6,9,"to the bedroom to change,
"
,,
6,9,"I took ill.
"
,,
6,9,"You'd best go to lunch
"
,,
6,9,"without me.
"
,,
6,9,"Why do I hear an engine?
"
,,
6,9,"Uh... because my stomach
"
,,
6,9,"is rumbling in a way
"
,,
6,9,"that sounds like the engine
"
,,
6,9,"of Joe's fishing truck.
"
,,
6,9,"Peter, are you lying?
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, now she's a doctor, guys.
"
,,
6,9,"Hey, Lois!
"
,,
6,9,"Quagmire says hi.
"
,,
6,9,"Damn it, Peter, you're going
"
,,
6,9,"fishing, aren't you?
"
,,
6,9,"You promised you'd come to lunch
"
,,
6,9,"with my parents today.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, Lois, until we get
"
,,
6,9,"an appointment secretary,
"
,,
6,9,"things like this are gonna continue
"
,,
6,9,"to fall through the cracks.
"
,,
6,9,"My parents are not gonna
"
,,
6,9,"like this, Peter.
"
,,
6,9,"You know they're still angry at
"
,,
6,9,"how you behaved at our wedding.
"
,,
6,9,"You may now kiss the bride,
"
,,
6,9,"Kiss her?
"
,,
6,9,"I am gonna
"
,,
6,9,"destroy her.
"
,,
6,9,"Mom, are you still mad
"
,,
6,9,"at Dad about yesterday?
"
,,
6,9,"Well, sort of.
"
,,
6,9,"I mean, we planned that
"
,,
6,9,"lunch two weeks ago.
"
,,
6,9,"But he promised
"
,,
6,9,"he'd go with me
"
,,
6,9,"to put flowers on my
"
,,
6,9,"grandmother's grave
"
,,
6,9,"this afternoon, so i guess it's all right.
"
,,
6,9,"Peter, are you ready...?
"
,,
6,9,"Oh. Right.
"
,,
6,9,"So, uh, a lot of tension
"
,,
6,9,"with Peter lately, huh?
"
,,
6,9,"Ugh, that's an
"
,,
6,9,"understatement, Brian.
"
,,
6,9,"He's been incredibly
"
,,
6,9,"thoughtless lately.
"
,,
6,9,"Even more so than usual.
"
,,
6,9,"But tonight
"
,,
6,9,"is our sex night,
"
,,
6,9,"and a little physical release
"
,,
6,9,"will do us both some good.
"
,,
6,9,"Peter, are you...?
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, come on!
"
,,
6,9,"Lois, I know it's late, but me and
"
,,
6,9,"the guys were going beekeeping.
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, my God, what the
"
,,
6,9,"hell is wrong with you?!
"
,,
6,9,"Whoa, someone just
"
,,
6,9,"yelled themselves
"
,,
6,9,"out of honey with breakfast.
"
,,
6,9,"I don't need honey, Peter,
"
,,
6,9,"I need a husband who wants
"
,,
6,9,"to spend time with me.
"
,,
6,9,"Can I make a suggestion?
"
,,
6,9,"All you two have done
"
,,
6,9,"is argue about stuff
"
,,
6,9,"for the past two weeks.
"
,,
6,9,"It's my guess you could
"
,,
6,9,"use a vacation.
"
,,
6,9,"Why don't you come out
"
,,
6,9,"to Martha's Vineyard
"
,,
6,9,"and watch me accept my award.
"
,,
6,9,"Wow, does that
"
,,
6,9,"sound wonderful.
"
,,
6,9,"Whoa, whoa, whoa,
"
,,
6,9,"that sounds expensive.
"
,,
6,9,"Can't we just do something
"
,,
6,9,"fun here at the house?
"
,,
6,9,"It's just as relaxing.
"
,,
6,9,"Hey, guys, I've decided
"
,,
6,9,"I'm gonna take up the drums.
"
,,
6,9,"I'll start packing.
"
,,
6,9,"Look, Quagmire, we're only gonna
"
,,
6,9,"be on Martha's Vineyard for a couple days.
"
,,
6,9,"Can't you just watch the kids?
"
,,
6,9,"Aw, man, you're more of a
"
,,
6,9,"letdown than Fruit Stripe gum.
"
,,
6,9,"What are we gonna do, Lois?
"
,,
6,9,"re out of town.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, what about Cleveland?
"
,,
6,9,"He's on the road touring
"
,,
6,9,"with Black Box.
"
,,
6,9,"Everybody, everybody
"
,,
6,9,"Everybody, everybody
"
,,
6,9,"Well, wait a minute,
"
,,
6,9,"what about that
"
,,
6,9,"nice old man who
"
,,
6,9,"lives up the street?
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, yeah, maybe Herbert
"
,,
6,9,"could watch the kids.
"
,,
6,9,"He seems like a responsible guy.
"
,,
6,9,"So it would only be till Monday
"
,,
6,9,"and we could pay you for it.
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah, and it's real easy,
"
,,
6,9,"I promise.
"
,,
6,9,"I mean, you've spent time
"
,,
6,9,"watching children, right?
"
,,
6,9,"Uh, yes, sir.
"
,,
6,9,"Yes, I have.
"
,,
6,9,"Wonderful.
"
,,
6,9,"Brian, this is wonderful.
"
,,
6,9,"I feel like one
"
,,
6,9,"of the Kennedys.
"
,,
6,9,"You know, the overprivileged
"
,,
6,9,"drunk ones,
"
,,
6,9,"not the socially responsible dead ones.
"
,,
6,9,"You know, this resort offers
"
,,
6,9,"some wonderful amenities.
"
,,
6,9,"They have bird watching, wine
"
,,
6,9,"tasting, horseback riding.
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah, they also have
"
,,
6,9,"stork startling.
"
,,
6,9,"Squawkety, squawkety, squawkety,
"
,,
6,9,"squawkety, squawkety, squawkety!
"
,,
6,9,"Your bird intelligence is no match
"
,,
6,9,"for my people intelligence.
"
,,
6,9,"All right, children,
"
,,
6,9,"your mammy and pappy
"
,,
6,9,"asked me to look after you
"
,,
6,9,"for the next couple days.
"
,,
6,9,"So I want to lay down
"
,,
6,9,"a few ground rules.
"
,,
6,9,"No cussing,
"
,,
6,9,"clean your plates,
"
,,
6,9,"and only a half hour of radio
"
,,
6,9,"and then it's off to bed.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, that sucks.
"
,,
6,9,"And don't you mouth off to me
"
,,
6,9,"or I'm gonna slap you
"
,,
6,9,"right in your penis.
"
,,
6,9,"No offense, Mr. Herbert,
"
,,
6,9,"but I'm a 17-year-old girl
"
,,
6,9,"and I don't need you here.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, no offense
"
,,
6,9,"to you, Meg,
"
,,
6,9,"but you're a 17-year-old girl
"
,,
6,9,"and I don't need you here.
"
,,
6,9,"What do you think's
"
,,
6,9,"keeping Peter?
"
,,
6,9,"I hope he gets here before
"
,,
6,9,"they give you your award.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, you're here, Lois.
"
,,
6,9,"That's enough for me.
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, you always know
"
,,
6,9,"just what to say.
"
,,
6,9,"And now, reading a passage
"
,,
6,9,"from his grand prize-winning
"
,,
6,9,"short essay, ""Amazing Grace,""
"
,,

6,9,"warmth and serenity of her home.
"
,,
6,9,"""Nothing from the first day
"
,,
6,9,"I saw her
"
,,
6,9,"""and no one that has
"
,,
6,9,"happened to me since
"
,,
6,9,"""has ever been as frightening
"
,,
6,9,"and as confusing.
"
,,
6,9,"""For no person I've ever known
"
,,
6,9,"has ever done more
"
,,
6,9,"""to make me feel more sure,
"
,,
6,9,"more insecure,
"
,,
6,9,"more important
"
,,
6,9,"and less significant. ""
"
,,
6,9,"That was beautiful,
"
,,
6,9,"Brian.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, you know
"
,,
6,9,"what they say-
"
,,
6,9,"write what's
"
,,
6,9,"in your heart.
"
,,
6,9,"Hey, oh!
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, did-did I miss
"
,,
6,9,"Byron's reward?
"
,,
6,9,"Brian's award.
"
,,
6,9,"And, yes, you did, Peter.
"
,,
6,9,"You've been
"
,,
6,9,"a good son, Brian.
"
,,
6,9,"And I'm sorry
"
,,
6,9,"you're so sick.
"
,,
6,9,"What?
"
,,
6,9,"Peter, where the hell
"
,,
6,9,"have you been?
"
,,
6,9,"Every time that
"
,,
6,9,"we go to a hotel,
"
,,
6,9,"you hide the key to
"
,,
6,9,"the minibar from me.
"
,,
6,9,"But I found it.
"
,,
6,9,"Found it.
"
,,
6,9,"You're a piece of
"
,,
6,9,"work, you know that?
"
,,
6,9,"An hour late
"
,,
6,9,"and you're drunk.
"
,,
6,9,"You had an opportunity to share
"
,,
6,9,"a beautiful moment with Brian
"
,,
6,9,"and you wasted it, wasted it like
"
,,
6,9,"the Osmond family wastes water.
"
,,
6,9,"Who's in the shower?
"
,,
6,9,"Is it Donny?
"
,,
6,9,"No, I showered earlier.
"
,,
6,9,"It could be Meryl.
"
,,
6,9,"Meryl's right here.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, where's Jimmy?
"
,,
6,9,"Jimmy's running through
"
,,
6,9,"the sprinklers in the yard.
"
,,
6,9,"Is it Marie?
"
,,
6,9,"No, no one's in there.
"
,,
6,9,"So the shower's just running
"
,,
6,9,"with no one in there?
"
,,
6,9,"That's right.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, I'll be
"
,,
6,9,"a son of a gun.
"
,,
6,9,"Hey.
"
,,
6,9,"Good morning.
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, good morning, Brian.
"
,,
6,9,"Ooh, that's a lovely
"
,,
6,9,"fragrance you're wearing.
"
,,
6,9,"What is it?
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, this?
"
,,
6,9,"This is Hartz-Mountain
"
,,
6,9,"flea dip.
"
,,
6,9,"Kills ticks, fleas,
"
,,
6,9,"and mosquitoes.
"
,,
6,9,"It's very potent.
"
,,
6,9,"Almost as potent as
"
,,
6,9,"the inspiration you give me
"
,,
6,9,"to plumb the deepest
"
,,
6,9,"fathoms of my soul
"
,,
6,9,"for a literary bounty
"
,,
6,9,"of truth and loveliness.
"
,,
6,9,"Aah! That's
"
,,
6,9,"so much better.
"
,,
6,9,"Ah, morning, Lois.
"
,,
6,9,"I'm sorry about
"
,,
6,9,"last night.
"
,,
6,9,"I promise I'll
"
,,
6,9,"make it up to you.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, if you really
"
,,
6,9,"mean that,
"
,,
6,9,"I was hoping we could go
"
,,
6,9,"paddle boating today.
"
,,
6,9,"Great, but can we
"
,,
6,9,"do it after 5:00?
"
,,
6,9,"There's a ballgame on.
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, well, then, maybe
"
,,
6,9,"Brian and I can hang out.
"
,,
6,9,"Do you mind, Brian?
"
,,
6,9,"No, not at all.
"
,,
6,9,"Good, now can you move, please?
"
,,
6,9,"You're blocking the screen.
"
,,
6,9,"We now return to
"
,,
6,9,"Damn, Nature, You Scary
"
,,
6,9,"on BET.
"
,,
6,9,"Damn, look at that
"
,,
6,9,"son-bitch go.
"
,,
6,9,"He hauling ass.
"
,,
6,9,"That thing come by my house,
"
,,
6,9,"I kill it.
"
,,
6,9,"That little rat looking thing
"
,,
6,9,"just got ate.
"
,,
6,9,"Damn, Nature, you scary!
"
,,
6,9,"Y'all know
"
,,
6,9,"what day it is?
"
,,
6,9,"No.
"
,,
6,9,"It's bath day.
"
,,
6,9,"I don't want to take a bath.
"
,,
6,9,"Not for you, silly.
"
,,
6,9,"It's bath day forme.
"
,,
6,9,"But I can't wash myself.
"
,,
6,9,"Know anybody with a pair
"
,,
6,9,"of strong, young hands
"
,,
6,9,"to help me in and
"
,,
6,9,"out of the tub?
"
,,
6,9,"Aw, rats!
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, I had so much
"
,,
6,9,"fun today, Brian.
"
,,
6,9,"So did I.
"
,,
6,9,"Hey, you feel like
"
,,
6,9,"grabbing something to eat?
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, I'd love to,
"
,,
6,9,"but Peter and I
"
,,
6,9,"were gonna get dinner at
"
,,
6,9,"that little place by the...
"
,,
6,9,"Lois...
"
,,
6,9,"Went to...
"
,,
6,9,"Well... looks
"
,,
6,9,"like lamfree.
"
,,
6,9,"Hey, you know
"
,,
6,9,"what might be fun?
"
,,
6,9,"How about we just
"
,,
6,9,"order room service
"
,,
6,9,"and watch a couple
"
,,
6,9,"of bad movies?
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah, that does
"
,,
6,9,"sound like fun.
"
,,
6,9,"I'll go rentVanilla Sky.
"
,,
6,9,"I said a bad movie,
"
,,
6,9,"not an abortion.
"
,,
6,9,"Ah, this is gonna be great-
"
,,
6,9,"a whole evening with Lois!
"
,,
6,9,"We are gonna have
"
,,
6,9,"such a fun time.
"
,,
6,9,"Lois, my darling!
"
,,
6,9,"Couple of steaks, some wine,
"
,,
6,9,"maybe a couple of sundaes...
"
,,
6,9,"Lois, my darling!
"
,,
6,9,"...little music,
"
,,
6,9,"some candlelight.
"
,,
6,9,"Lois, my darling!
"
,,
6,9,"What am I doing?
"
,,
6,9,"This is Lois, Peter's wife.
"
,,
6,9,"H- How can I even think
"
,,
6,9,"about trying anything?
"
,,
6,9,"Hello?
"
,,
6,9,"Hey, Brian, it's me.
"
,,
6,9,"I got a question for you.
"
,,
6,9,"Herbert and I
"
,,
6,9,"are playing Scattergories.
"
,,
6,9,"Would you count Nyquil
"
,,
6,9,"as a beverage?
"
,,
6,9," No, right?
"
,,
6,9," No.
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah, not gonna fly, old man.
"
,,
6,9,"Thanks, Brian.
"
,,
6,9,"Damn it! I'm missing
"
,,
6,9,"Boy Meets Worldfor this?
"
,,
6,9,"This is so much fun, Brian.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, it's a
"
,,
6,9,"Saturday night-
"
,,
6,9,"sorry the video store
"
,,
6,9,"pickings were a little sparse.
"
,,
6,9,"Hope you like
"
,,
6,9,"Roman Holiday.
"
,,
6,9,"Tee-hee! I lied.
"
,,
6,9,"I was a princess
"
,,
6,9,"the whole time.
"
,,
6,9,"You bitch!
"
,,
6,9,"I'm gonna punch you
"
,,
6,9,"in the face!
"
,,
6,9,"Ah, that was
"
,,
6,9,"a lovely dinner.
"
,,
6,9,"I saved all my scraps
"
,,
6,9,"in a bag for you.
"
,,
6,9,"Thanks. You know, Lois,
"
,,
6,9,"I'm sure you've already
"
,,
6,9,"figured this out, but...
"
,,
6,9,"that essay I wrote-
"
,,
6,9,"I wrote it about you.
"
,,
6,9,"Aw... I had a hunch.
"
,,
6,9,"Thank you, Brian.
"
,,
6,9,"I'm glad you
"
,,
6,9,"shared that with me.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, you know, Lois,
"
,,
6,9,"you mean a lot to me.
"
,,
6,9,"I mean, things you say
"
,,
6,9,"and things you do
"
,,
6,9,"resonate with me
"
,,
6,9,"in a big way.
"
,,
6,9,"When you drive away
"
,,
6,9,"to go to the market,
"
,,
6,9,"I just don't know what
"
,,
6,9,"to do with myself.
"
,,
6,9,"And then when
"
,,
6,9,"I hear that car
"
,,
6,9,"coming up the driveway,
"
,,
6,9,"I just go berserk.
"
,,
6,9,"I mean, you know, half the time, when
"
,,
6,9,"you go to the market,
"
,,
6,9,"I just assume you're
"
,,
6,9,"leaving forever, and when you get back,
"
,,
6,9,"I realize I have no idea
"
,,
6,9,"how long you've been gone, and I...
"
,,
6,9,"Well, you know what,
"
,,
6,9,"I'm-I'm rambling. I...
"
,,
6,9,"Would you like
"
,,
6,9,"some more champagne?
"
,,
6,9,"I'd love some.
"
,,
6,9,"Ah! My head is swimming.
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
6,9,"Brian, no!
"
,,
6,9,"Now, stop it!
"
,,
6,9,"What are you doing?!
"
,,
6,9,"I can't help myself, Lois!
"
,,
6,9,"I know you're married to
"
,,
6,9,"Peter, but I love you and
"
,,
6,9,"I can't stand it anymore!
"
,,
6,9,"Brian, no!
"
,,
6,9,"No! Get down! Get down!
"
,,
6,9,"This is a good sweater!
"
,,
6,9,"Brian, I think
"
,,
6,9,"you'd better go.
"
,,
6,9,"Lois, I'd really like
"
,,
6,9,"to talk about this.
"
,,
6,9,"No! Stop scratching
"
,,
6,9,"the door!
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, my God, I attacked Lois!
"
,,
6,9,"What the hell was I thinking?
"
,,
6,9,"I'm a rapist!
"
,,
6,9,"I'm-I'm no better than...
"
,,
6,9,"Kobe Bryant or Mike Tyson
"
,,
6,9,"or Reagan!
"
,,
6,9,"Hey, Brian, another
"
,,
6,9,"Scattergories question.
"
,,
6,9,"The category is ""Type of Pet. ""
"
,,
6,9,"Herbert put ""Cambodian. ""
"
,,
6,9,"That's not right, right?
"
,,
6,9,"Look, Stewie, I can't talk
"
,,
6,9,"about this now, all right?
"
,,
6,9,"Geez, what's
"
,,
6,9,"yourproblem?
"
,,
6,9,"I- I just...
"
,,
6,9,"I did a bad thing,
"
,,
6,9,"and I don't know what to do about it.
"
,,
6,9,"I feel like
"
,,
6,9,"I'm losing my mind.
"
,,
6,9,"Ugh! That's howlfelt at
"
,,
6,9,"that Grateful Dead show.
"
,,
6,9,"Does anybody want
"
,,
6,9,"to buy my shirt?!
"
,,
6,9,"I'll trade you my shirt
"
,,
6,9,"for a grilled cheese!
"
,,
6,9,"So, what happened, sport?
"
,,
6,9,"Come on, talk to
"
,,
6,9,"your pal, Stewie.
"
,,
6,9,"All right, but only because
"
,,
6,9,"I've got to tell somebody.
"
,,
6,9,"I- I pretty much just
"
,,
6,9,"threw myself at Lois.
"
,,
6,9,"So, you finally
"
,,
6,9,"did it, huh?
"
,,
6,9,"Well, look, Brian,
"
,,
6,9,"as your friend,
"
,,
6,9,"I- I should tell you
"
,,
6,9,"that that vagina is ground zero, man.
"
,,
6,9,"I mean, I-I just...
"
,,
6,9,"I wrecked that thing
"
,,
6,9,"on the way out.
"
,,
6,9,"And just to be a jerk,
"
,,
6,9,"I carved ""Brooks was here"" in the wall.
"
,,
6,9,"Did-did you see that?
"
,,
6,9,"Did you see
"
,,
6,9,"""Brooks was here""?
"
,,
6,9,"We didn't have sex.
"
,,
6,9,"'Course, what with
"
,,
6,9,"Chris going before me,
"
,,
6,9,"I pretty much just
"
,,
6,9,"walked out of there.
"
,,
6,9,"Didn't even have
"
,,
6,9,"to stoop over.
"
,,
6,9,"There was even room to
"
,,
6,9,"twirl a cane as I strolled.
"
,,
6,9,"You're exaggerating.
"
,,
6,9,"Only a little bit-
"
,,
6,9,"that's the messed-up thing.
"
,,
6,9,"Morning, Lois.
"
,,
6,9,"Peter, there you are.
"
,,
6,9,"Were you down at that hotel bar
"
,,
6,9,"all night again?
"
,,
6,9,"I was, Lois- and you know
"
,,
6,9,"who's staying at this hotel?
"
,,
6,9,"Nathan Lane!
"
,,
6,9,"We got wasted at the bar,
"
,,
6,9,"and he ended up
"
,,
6,9,"asking me to marry him.
"
,,
6,9,"So I convinced this
"
,,
6,9,"minister to do the job,
"
,,
6,9,"but the joke's on Nathan Lane,
"
,,
6,9,"'cause gay people
"
,,
6,9,"can't get married!
"
,,
6,9,"They can in this
"
,,
6,9,"state, Peter.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, in that case,
"
,,
6,9,"we're registered at Filene's.
"
,,
6,9,"God, you've spent half
"
,,
6,9,"this entire trip intoxicated!
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, I'm intoxicated
"
,,
6,9,"all right, Lois-
"
,,
6,9,"by the beauty and magic
"
,,
6,9,"of Martha's Vineyard.
"
,,
6,9,"Nantucket, Cape Cod,
"
,,
6,9,"and all the great destinations
"
,,
6,9,"that make Massachusetts
"
,,
6,9,"the wondrous place it is.
"
,,
6,9,"of the red, white and blue.</i>
"
,,
6,9,"I am so glad Brian
"
,,
6,9,"brought us out here, Lois.
"
,,
6,9,"He's a real pal,
"
,,
6,9,"you know that?
"
,,
6,9,"Well, it's actually Brian
"
,,
6,9,"I need to talk to you about.
"
,,
6,9,"Boy, he's a hell
"
,,
6,9,"of a guy, isn't he?
"
,,
6,9,"He's the one guy
"
,,
6,9,"I know I can trust.
"
,,
6,9,"Brian tried
"
,,
6,9,"to have sex with me.
"
,,
6,9,"Was he bigger than me?
"
,,
6,9,"""... and they told Peter
"
,,
6,9,"to stay away from the wolf.
"
,,
6,9,"But he didn't
"
,,
6,9,"listen to them... ""
"
,,
6,9,"'cause he's his own man.
"
,,
6,9,"And he knew that sometimes
"
,,
6,9,"the things that seem
"
,,
6,9,"the most dangerous turn out
"
,,
6,9,"to be the most fun!
"
,,
6,9,"Yes, sir, it was a good day
"
,,
6,9,"for young Peter.
"
,,
6,9,"Are you a pedophile?
"
,,
6,9,"Hey, uh...
"
,,
6,9,"Lois told me there was
"
,,
6,9,"some funny business.
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah, what of it?
"
,,
6,9,"Well, it's just...
"
,,
6,9,"I can't help but feel
"
,,
6,9,"a little betrayed, Brian.
"
,,
6,9,"Lois is my wife,
"
,,
6,9,"and... well, I mean,
"
,,
6,9,"all the dry food I've bought
"
,,
6,9,"for you over the years?
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah, well, you don't
"
,,
6,9,"deserve her, you know that?
"
,,
6,9,"Say what, now?
"
,,
6,9,"You don't deserve her.
"
,,
6,9,"She does nothing
"
,,
6,9,"but give and give and give,
"
,,
6,9,"and you repay her
"
,,
6,9,"with selfishness and neglect.
"
,,
6,9,"I mean, you've barely spent
"
,,
6,9,"any time with her at
"
,,
6,9,"all on this vacation.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, who the hell are you to
"
,,
6,9,"tell me how to run my marriage?
"
,,
6,9,"You can't even hang on
"
,,
6,9,"to a girlfriend
"
,,
6,9,"for more than a couple months!
"
,,
6,9,"What the hell is that
"
,,
6,9,"supposed to mean?
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, you're a freakin' train
"
,,
6,9,"wreck with that crap, Brian.
"
,,
6,9,"You couldn't even get
"
,,
6,9,"Gillian to take you back,
"
,,
6,9,"and she was dumber
"
,,
6,9,"than Lou Ferrigno.
"
,,
6,9,"Stop it!
"
,,
6,9,"Stop it!
"
,,
6,9,"Get off my husband!
"
,,
6,9,"Wait a minute, Brian.
"
,,
6,9,"Nathan Lane is right.
"
,,
6,9,"What are we doing?
"
,,
6,9,"Look, I'm sorry, all right?
"
,,
6,9,"It's just... wh-when
"
,,
6,9,"you have feelings for someone
"
,,
6,9,"that are strong enough,
"
,,
6,9,"you just...
"
,,
6,9,"I don't know, lose sight
"
,,
6,9,"of the rest of the world.
"
,,
6,9,"Brian, she's my wife.
"
,,
6,9,"And you're my best pal.
"
,,
6,9,"So what are we
"
,,
6,9,"gonna do about this?
"
,,
6,9,"I promise, Peter,
"
,,
6,9,"nothing like this will ever happen again.
"
,,
6,9,"Thanks, old buddy.
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah, blah, blah, blah!
"
,,
6,9,"That's all well and good, Peter.
"
,,
6,9,"Now, get ready, we're having
"
,,
6,9,"dinner with my parents tonight!
"
,,
6,9,"Oh. Right.
"
,,
6,9,"I just feel terrible
"
,,
6,9,"about this whole thing, Lois.
"
,,
6,9,"Can you ever forgive me?
"
,,
6,9,"Yes, Brian, I can.
"
,,
6,9,"But there's something
"
,,
6,9,"you deserve to know.
"
,,
6,9,"What's that?
"
,,
6,9,"Well...
"
,,
6,9,"it's not like I haven't
"
,,
6,9,"thought about it.
"
,,
6,9,"Really?
"
,,
6,9,"Well,yes. I mean,
"
,,
6,9,"you and I have a lot in common,
"
,,
6,9,"and we've spent so much time
"
,,
6,9,"together over the years, and...
"
,,
6,9,"of course, that essay you wrote,
"
,,
6,9,"oh, it really touched my heart.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, to be honest, Lois,
"
,,
6,9,"I ripped off
"
,,
6,9,"most of that speech
"
,,
6,9,"from Summer of '42.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, it was still nice.
"
,,
6,9,"Let me just ask you this.
"
,,
6,9,"When these thoughts about you
"
,,
6,9,"and I have crossed your mind,
"
,,
6,9,"is it... good?
"
,,
6,9,"What do you mean?
"
,,
6,9,"Well, uh, uh...
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, a lot of times when Peter and
"
,,
6,9,"I are having sex, I feel suffocated.
"
,,
6,9,"But with you, I imagine
"
,,
6,9,"it would be like doing it
"
,,
6,9,"with a stuffed animal.
"
,,
6,9,"Everybody ready to go?
"
,,
6,9,"All set, Peter.
"
,,
6,9,"Good.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, we may be leaving
"
,,
6,9,"Martha's Vineyard,
"
,,
6,9,"but the spirit
"
,,
6,9,"of this wonderful place
"
,,
6,9,"will stay in our hearts
"
,,
6,9,"all the way home.
"
,,
6,9,"'Cause after all...
"
,,
6,9,"white and blue</i>
"
,,
6,9,"And now back to G.I. Jose.
"
,,
6,9,"Hey, guys, let's go swim
"
,,
6,9,"in the old quarry.
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah!
"
,,
6,9,"Wait a minute, kids.
"
,,
6,9,"Don't go swimming
"
,,
6,9,"in that quarry.
"
,,
6,9,"It's dangerous.
"
,,
6,9,"Wow, thanks, G.I. Jose.
"
,,
6,9,"Hey, you guys want to buy
"
,,
6,9,"some gum or cotton candy
"
,,
6,9,"or a stuffed animal?
"
,,
6,9,"How about an inflatable
"
,,
6,9,"mallet, huh?
"
,,
6,9,"This is fun.
"
,,
6,9,"You can hit your friend
"
,,
6,9,"on the head with it.
"
,,
6,9,"But don't hit him on
"
,,
6,9,"the head with it.
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah, thanks.
"
,,
6,9,"I don't really need
"
,,
6,9,"any of that stuff.
"
,,
6,9,"You got any dents
"
,,
6,9,"you need hammered out?
"
,,
6,9,"G.I. Jose
"
,,
6,9,"Good evening,
"
,,
6,9,"I'm Tom Tucker.
"
,,
6,9,"Coming up, important traffic
"
,,
6,9,"news that can't help you
"
,,
6,9,"because you're some place
"
,,
6,9,"where a TV is.
"
,,
6,9,"But first,
"
,,
6,9,"get ready, Quahog,
"
,,
6,9,"because Barry Manilow will
"
,,
6,9,"be performing this weekend
"
,,
6,9,"at the Quahog Performing Arts Center.
"
,,
6,9,"Barry Manilow.
"
,,
6,9,"What a joke.
"
,,
6,9,"So stupid.
"
,,
6,9,"And boring as hell.
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah, no kidding.
"
,,
6,9,"You couldn't pay me
"
,,
6,9,"to go to that thing.
"
,,
6,9,"Hey, you know what
"
,,
6,9,"we should do?
"
,,
6,9,"We should go just as a goof.
"
,,
6,9,"That'd be hilarious.
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah, just look at
"
,,
6,9,"all the idiots.
"
,,
6,9,"All the dumb ass
"
,,
6,9,"Manilow fans.
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah.
"
,,
6,9,"I mean, he's got,
"
,,
6,9,"like, one good song.
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah, I mean, ""Mandy""
"
,,
6,9,"is not terrible.
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah, the
"
,,
6,9,"opening's okay.
"
,,
6,9,"And I guess you can't
"
,,
6,9,"hate ""Copacabana.""
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah, if you're
"
,,
6,9,"in the right mood.
"
,,
6,9,"""Daybreak""
"
,,
6,9,"is a good song.
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, yeah.
"
,,
6,9,"That's a good song.
"
,,
6,9,"And I like
"
,,
6,9,"""Weekend in New England.
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah, that's a good one.
"
,,
6,9,"""Looks Like We Made It.""
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah, it's not bad.
"
,,
6,9,"Right?
"
,,
6,9,"I love Barry Manilow.
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, my God, he's the best!
"
,,
6,9,"I have everything
"
,,
6,9,"he's ever recorded!
"
,,
6,9,"Me, too!
"
,,
6,9,"In my car!
"
,,
6,9,"We have to go
"
,,
6,9,"to that concert.
"
,,
6,9,"We are going
"
,,
6,9,"to that concert.
"
,,
6,9,"And I'm...
"
,,
6,9,"Ready to take a chance again
"
,,
6,9,"Ready to put
"
,,
6,9,"my love on the line
"
,,
6,9,"With you
"
,,
6,9,"Been living with nothing
"
,,
6,9,"to show for it
"
,,
6,9,"You get what you get
"
,,
6,9,"when you go for it
"
,,
6,9,"And I'm ready to take
"
,,
6,9,"A chance again with you
"
,,
6,9,"Thank you.
"
,,
6,9,"Thank you very much.
"
,,
6,9,"You're welcome.
"
,,
6,9,"For this next song,
"
,,
6,9,"I'm gonna need some help
"
,,
6,9,"from a member of the audience.
"
,,
6,9,"So, let's see, um...
"
,,
6,9,"what's your name?
"
,,
6,9,"Claire
"
,,
6,9,".Uh... no, I don't like that.
"
,,
6,9,"Uh, what's yours?
"
,,
6,9,"Harriet.
"
,,
6,9,"Uh, no, it's got to be two syllables.
"
,,
6,9,"Peter! Cleveland!
"
,,
6,9,"Joseph! Joseph!
"
,,
6,9,"Quagmire!
"
,,
6,9,"Wow, that's exotic.
"
,,
6,9,"All right, why don't you come up
"
,,
6,9,"and join me on the stage?
"
,,
6,9,"Go, go, go, go, go! Oh, my God!
"
,,
6,9,"I hate you so much rig now!
"
,,
6,9,"The night goes into morning
"
,,
6,9,"Just another day
"
,,
6,9,"Happy people pass my way
"
,,
6,9,"Looking in their eyes I see a memory
"
,,
6,9,"I never realized how happy you made me
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, Quagmire Oh...!
"
,,
6,9,"Well, you came and you gave without taking
"
,,
6,9,"I would never take from you,Barry.
"
,,
6,9,"But I sent you away
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, Quagmire
"
,,
6,9,"You kissed me and stopped me from shaking
"
,,
6,9,"And I need you today
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, Quagmire.
"
,,
6,9,"God, he's so talented.
"
,,
6,9,"You know he wrote all those
"
,,
6,9,"Kentucky Fried Chicken jingles.
"
,,
6,9,"I don't care for them.
"
,,
6,9,"Not after what happened to Foghorn Leghorn.
"
,,
6,9,"I say, I says on, what do we got brewing in here?
"
,,
6,9,"I was walking by when I picked up the smell
"
,,
6,9,"of 11 herbs and spice... agh!
"
,,
6,9,"Look at that boy,
"
,,
6,9,"running all around like a chicken with its head cut...
"
,,
6,9,"Wait a minute.
"
,,
6,9,"This Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!
"
,,
6,9,"One day only.
"
,,
6,9,"Lasik Eye Centers will heal your eyes.
"
,,
6,9,"How much would you pay for laser eye surgery?
"
,,
6,9,"How about 12.000$?
"
,,
6,9,"Dr. Lee Feldstein
"
,,
6,9,"Fully licensed
"
,,
6,9,"Fully trained

,,
6,9,"Fully jewish

,,
6,9,"So come on down
"
,,
6,9,"to the Hydrox Arena this Sunday, Sunday!
"
,,
6,9,"Get your eyesight fixed.
"
,,
6,9,"Unless you don't have the balls.
"
,,
6,9,"Jewish
"
,,
6,9,"Hey, I could use some Jew eye surgery.
"
,,
6,9,"What the hell? Where's my wallet?
"
,,
6,9,"Aw, crap, I must've dropped it at the Barry Manilow concert.
"
,,
6,9,"Dropped it at the what? And where was I?
"
,,
6,9,"Agh, Peter,you and your excuses
"
,,
6,9,"for losing your wallet.
"
,,
6,9,"""I dropped it at the concert.""
"
,,
6,9,"""The hooker took it.""
"
,,
6,9,"""It's with my other family.""
"
,,
6,9,"That one was true.
"
,,
6,9,"And let me tell you something,
"
,,
6,9,"they appreciate me for who I am.
"
,,
6,9,"All right, Peter,have a good business trip.
"
,,
6,9,"Taxi!
"
,,
6,9,"Who's hungry?
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah! Mommy's home!
"
,,
6,9,"Hello, dear.
"
,,
6,9,"I'm so glad you're home.
"
,,
6,9,"While you were away,I tried to do the laundry.
"
,,
6,9,"Your favorite shirt.
"
,,
6,9,"Adam Kenneth Handleman,when will you learn?
"
,,
6,9,"So, Peter, any luck finding your wallet?
"
,,
6,9,"No, and it's getting to be a pain in the ass.
"
,,
6,9,"I got no money.
"
,,
6,9,"I couldn't even afford to get my hair cut yesterday.
"
,,
6,9,"That'll be five dollars.
"
,,
6,9,"Sorry, lost my wallet.
"
,,
6,9,"But I already cut your hair.
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah, well, guess there'snothing you can do about it now.
"
,,
6,9,"That son of a bitch.
"
,,
6,9,"And I can't rent movies anymore.
"
,,
6,9,"Uh, yes, I'd like to rent this copy of Garden State.
"
,,
6,9,"Okay, I'll just need a picture ID.
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, I don't have one.
"
,,
6,9,"I'll rentit then.
"
,,
6,9,"It could've been me.
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, my God, Peter,
"
,,
6,9,"your visa bill is $16,000!
"
,,
6,9,"Somebody's been using your credit card.
"
,,
6,9,"Didn't you cancel it when you lost your wallet?
"
,,
6,9,"I hear what you're saying, Lois,
"
,,
6,9,"but unlike my credit card,
"
,,
6,9,"I'm carrying a very low rate of interest.
"
,,
6,9,"Let me see that.
"
,,
6,9,"A big screen TV,a massage chair
"
,,
6,9,"from Sharper Image,plane tickets...
"
,,
6,9,"Peter, someone has obviously stolen your credit card.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, here's the good news, Brian.
"
,,
6,9,"Whoever the thief is, he's spending less
"
,,
6,9,"than my wife.
"
,,
6,9,"Wait, look at this.
"
,,
6,9,"He eats at House of Chungevery day.
"
,,
6,9,"House of Chung, huh?
"
,,
6,9,"Come on, let's go, Brian.
"
,,
6,9,"The place is packed.
"
,,
6,9,"How are we gonna figure out who has your credit card?
"
,,
6,9,"I got it, Brian. Smell my ass.
"
,,
6,9,"What? Smell my ass.
"
,,
6,9,"It's where I keep my wallet.
"
,,
6,9,"Get the scent and then find the guy that smells like me.
"
,,
6,9,"Peter, that'sridiculous.
"
,,
6,9,"Come on, boy, get the scent.
"
,,
6,9,"Cut it out! Get a good sniff.
"
,,
6,9,"That's disgusting.
"
,,
6,9,"You're an idiot, you know that?
"
,,
6,9,"Wait a minute.
"
,,
6,9,"Your wallet's
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, my God, it's you!
"
,,
6,9,"James Woods.
"
,,
6,9,"Hello, Peter.
"
,,
6,9,"I've been expecting you.
"
,,
6,9,"You stole my credit card, you son of a bitch.
"
,,
6,9,"What did I ever do to you?
"
,,
6,9,"That's a good question, Peter.
"
,,
6,9,"What did you ever do to me, hmm?
"
,,
6,9,"What did you ever do to James Woods?
"
,,
6,9,"Well, I locked you in a wooden crate
"
,,
6,9,"and forgot to put an air hole in it.
"
,,
6,9,"Forgot to put an air hole in it.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, you kind ofhad it coming.
"
,,
6,9,"Look, Mr. Woods, just give Peter back his wallet.
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, no, Brian.
"
,,
6,9,"I'm just getting started.
"
,,
6,9,"Peter, you humiliated me.
"
,,
6,9,"You put me through hell.
"
,,
6,9,"And now you're gonna pay for it.
"
,,
6,9,"So get ready...
"
,,
6,9,"fatso.
"
,,
6,9,"Lois, we found the guy who stole my wallet.
"
,,
6,9,"You'll never guess who it was.
"
,,
6,9,"James Woods?
"
,,
6,9,"Hello, stranger.
"
,,
6,9,"I don't recall inviting you into my home.
"
,,
6,9,"Peter, he's been here for four hours.
"
,,
6,9,"I told him to leave, but he keeps saying he lives here.
"
,,
6,9,"I say, this is more uncomfortable
"
,,
6,9,"than having James Brady at a cocktail party.
"
,,
6,9,"Right, so I got my hand gun
"
,,
6,9,"and I'm just randomly firing it into a crowd of people
"
,,
6,9,"and then...
"
,,
6,9,"And then what?
"
,,
6,9,"And nothing. Nothing.
"
,,
6,9,"No, no, I'm anxious to hear
"
,,
6,9,"the conclusion of your story.
"
,,
6,9,"Ah, it's stupid.
"
,,
6,9,"Stupid story.
"
,,
6,9,"I'm calling the police.
"
,,
6,9,"That won't be necessary.
"
,,
6,9,"I already did.
"
,,
6,9,"Hello, Officer. Would you be kind enough
"
,,
6,9,"to remove this trespasser from my home?
"
,,
6,9,"What are you talking about? This is my house.
"
,,
6,9,"No, this house belongs to Peter Griffin.
"
,,
6,9,"And that's me.
"
,,
6,9,"Hmm... driver's license,
"
,,
6,9,"Social Security card, passport,title to the house.
"
,,
6,9,"This puts me in a tough spot.
"
,,
6,9,"Joe, you can't possibly believe this.
"
,,
6,9,"You know who Peter is.
"
,,
6,9,"I know, Lois, but this man has all the paperwork.
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, come on,this is identity theft.
"
,,
6,9,"I hate to have to do this,
"
,,
6,9,"but I'm afraid legally I have no choice.
"
,,
6,9,"I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, sir.
"
,,
6,9,"Thanks, Joe.
"
,,
6,9,"Clam later? We'll hoist a few?
"
,,
6,9,"Sure, Peter.Joe!
"
,,
6,9,"Hey, not so fast, pal.
"
,,
6,9,"Those are my clothes.
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, come on. You heard him, fella.
"
,,
6,9,"Take 'em off. Right down to the poop sack.
"
,,
6,9,"What?
"
,,
6,9,"You don't all weara poop sack?
"
,,
6,9,"Damn it, Bonnie!
"
,,
6,9,"You lied to me about the poop sack!
"
,,
6,9,"Hello, family.
"
,,
6,9,"Hello, honey.
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, schnoopy...
"
,,
6,9,"Stop calling me that.
"
,,
6,9,"I don't care what the law says,
"
,,
6,9,"you're not Peter Griffin, you're James Woods.
"
,,
6,9,"I should've warned you,
"
,,
6,9,"she can be a real bitch in the morning.
"
,,
6,9,"Mom, this is really weird.
"
,,
6,9,"I want Dad back. I don't.
"
,,
6,9,"Having a celebrity dad is a real thrill.
"
,,
6,9,"Not like the fake thrill
"
,,
6,9,"of running into your ex-girlfriend on the street.
"
,,
6,9,"Rob?
"
,,
6,9,"Hey!
"
,,
6,9,"Hey! How are you?
"
,,
6,9,"God, it's good to see you.
"
,,
6,9,"Good to see you, too.
"
,,
6,9,"How's my dog?
"
,,
6,9,"I'm sorry, your dog?
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, I had to give him away.
"
,,
6,9,"Gave him away!
"
,,
6,9,"Well, Dave's allergic. Dave!
"
,,
6,9,"All right, so there's a Dave.
"
,,
6,9,"That's great. God, Dave sounds great.
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah, he is.
"
,,
6,9,"And his parents are so sweet.
"
,,
6,9,"Ah, met his parents and they're sweet.
"
,,
6,9,"Just older Daves, huh?
"
,,
6,9,"What a family. God, it's good to see you.
"
,,
6,9,"You won't get away with this, Woods.
"
,,
6,9,"You know, you're not supposed to be in the house, Brian.
"
,,
6,9,"You're more of an outdoor dog.
"
,,
6,9,"What the hell does that mean?
"
,,
6,9,"This is so humiliating.
"
,,
6,9,"For God's sake, I went to Brown
"
,,
6,9,"and he's got me out here tied to a post like some kind...
"
,,
6,9,"What the hell?
"
,,
6,9,"This rope was a lot longer, and now it's somehow gotten shorter.
"
,,
6,9,"What sort of black magic is this?
"
,,
6,9,"Brian, guess what?
"
,,
6,9,"I gave James Woods your novel to read,
"
,,
6,9,"and you're not gonna believe this.
"
,,
6,9,"Really? Did he like it?
"
,,
6,9,"He wants to option it and make a movie!
"
,,
6,9,"Really?
"
,,
6,9,"No, he didn't really
"
,,
6,9,"respond to it. Oh.
"
,,
6,9,"Listen, I need your help.
"
,,
6,9,"Run inside and get me a pair of scissors.
"
,,
6,9,"Okay. I just hope I don't get distracted.
"
,,
6,9,"I am a baby, after all.
"
,,
6,9,"Ooh, look, a brightly colored dish towel!
"
,,
6,9,"What did I come in here for?
"
,,
6,9,"Brian, what are you doing tied to Meg's pole?
"
,,
6,9,"James Woods did it.
"
,,
6,9,"Hey, where'd you get the clothes?
"
,,
6,9,"I always keep a spare at Quagmire's.
"
,,
6,9,"I gotta tell you though,
"
,,
6,9,"there was some weird stuff going on over there today.
"
,,
6,9,"Hey, Quagmire can I...?Hang-Hang on a second.
"
,,
6,9,"And that's why I contend
"
,,
6,9,"that when Frost speaks of birch trees,
"
,,
6,9,"he may very well be talking about himself.
"
,,
6,9,"No, Glenn, that's not...Gloria, please.
"
,,
6,9,"You wanna hear my interpretation,
"
,,
6,9,"or are you simply going to tell me that I'm wrong?
"
,,
6,9,"I'm simply pointing out...
"
,,
6,9,"Yes. We know, you'r every well read.
"
,,
6,9,"But this is poetry we're talking about,
"
,,
6,9,"and I think when it comes to poetry, you can't be wrong.
"
,,
6,9,"What Peter?!
"
,,
6,9,"Nothing, nothing. Sorry to interrupt.
"
,,
6,9,"The cedars represent society.
"
,,
6,9,"Sorry to interrupt.
"
,,
6,9,"Listen, you gotta get out of here.
"
,,
6,9,"If James Woods sees you, he's gonna call the cops.
"
,,
6,9,"I miss my family, Brian,
"
,,
6,9,"and I gotta see 'em.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, well.
"
,,
6,9,"A trespasser on my property.
"
,,
6,9,"That's the worst thing that'shappened to me since...
"
,,
6,9,"You wouldn't!
"
,,
6,9,"It's up to you, Peter.
"
,,
6,9,"Either you leave now...
"
,,
6,9,"or I set up one of your random flashbacks.
"
,,
6,9,"All right, all right,all right, okay.
"
,,
6,9,"Peter, what do you care...?
"
,,
6,9,"No, no, Brian, he's serious.
"
,,
6,9,"I'll come back for you, Lois.
"
,,
6,9,"And I'll set up all the flashbacks, just like I used to.
"
,,
6,9,"Like the time I swallowed that midget
"
,,
6,9,"who played Mini-Me just so I could make you laugh.
"
,,
6,9,"You ready for dinner, Peter?
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, yeah. In fact...
"
,,
6,9,"my stomach has been talking to me all day.
"
,,
6,9,"I said my stomach has been talking to me all day.
"
,,
6,9,"Come on, say the line.
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, oh, there he is.
"
,,
6,9,"You know what, he slipped into my colon.
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah, oh, damn it, he's smothered.
"
,,
6,9,"Uh, but-but, let... just,lemme just ask you this, Lois-
"
,,
6,9,"if my stomach had said,""Hell yeah I'm hungry.
"
,,
6,9,"How 'bout some pork chops?""
"
,,
6,9,"Would you have thought that was funny?
"
,,
6,9,"Eh, not really.
"
,,
6,9,"Ah. Well, then, this has been an absolute misfire.
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, this is just awful.
"
,,
6,9,"James Woods is destroying this family,
"
,,
6,9,"and all just to get back at Peter.
"
,,
6,9,"I know, he's doing all the stuff Dad usually does.
"
,,
6,9,"Right now he's upstairs talking to Meg.
"
,,
6,9,"Now, Meg, you want to be thin
"
,,
6,9,"like all the Hollywood starlets, right?
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah, but I love to eat.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, I've got a way that you can eat all you want
"
,,
6,9,"and look like a Hollywood starlet.
"
,,
6,9,"Meg, let me introduce you to Mr. Pukey.
"
,,
6,9,"Hiya, Meg.Hi.
"
,,
6,9,"Gosh, Mr. Pukey,
"
,,
6,9,"you sure are good at making fat women hot.
"
,,
6,9,"Wow, thanks.
"
,,
6,9,"You think you could help out my friend Meg here?
"
,,
6,9,"Yeah, I think I could give her a... hand.
"
,,
6,9,"Now close your eyes, Meg,
"
,,
6,9,"and let Mr. Pukey help you out.
"
,,
6,9,"When did Reese Witherspoon get here?
"
,,
6,9,"Mr. Woods, how do I get a girl to like me?
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, Chris, I'm your father.
"
,,
6,9,"Call me Dad.
"
,,
6,9,"Um, okay... Dad.
"
,,
6,9,"How do I geta girl to like me?
"
,,
6,9,"Well, there's a number of ways, Chris.
"
,,
6,9,"Uh, for example, uh,Kate Moss and I
"
,,
6,9,"had the same coke supplier,
"
,,
6,9,"and he threw a punch social one day
"
,,
6,9,"and we both happened to be there.
"
,,
6,9,"Next thing you know,
"
,,
6,9,"we're both in the back room, slam-bang.
"
,,
6,9,"I went bareback.
"
,,
6,9,"Wow, she sounds like assla act.
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, not at all, Chris. No, not at all.
"
,,
6,9,"Thanks, Dad. I feel better.
"
,,
6,9,"Off I go on my merry way
"
,,
6,9,"Life is great and I'm happy with my dad.
"
,,
6,9,"What am I gonna do, Brian?
"
,,
6,9,"James Woods has taken my life and my family.
"
,,
6,9,"I know, Peter,but identity theft
"
,,
6,9,"is one of the hardest things to fight.
"
,,
6,9,"How you gonna handle it?
"
,,
6,9,"I don't know, Brian.
"
,,
6,9,"All I know is, I sure do miss Lois.
"
,,
6,9,"I gotta find a way to see her.
"
,,
6,9,"And I think I just got an idea.
"
,,
6,9,"A much better idea than when I did magic for the blind.
"
,,
6,9,"Is this your card?
"
,,
6,9,"I don't know.
"
,,
6,9,"Was it a red card?
"
,,
6,9,"I don't know what red is.
"
,,
6,9,"Ta-da.
"
,,
6,9,"You know what's amazing, Lois?
"
,,
6,9,"A week from tomorrow,
"
,,
6,9,"it'll be 20 years we've been married.
"
,,
6,9,"I married Peter Griffin, you lunatic!
"
,,
6,9,"Uh, hello.I was there, see?
"
,,
6,9,"Hi, everyone. Sorry I'm late.
"
,,
6,9,"I brought friend home for dinner.
"
,,
6,9,"Mom... Dad...
"
,,
6,9,"This is Scooter.
"
,,
6,9,"Uh... hello, Scooter.
"
,,
6,9,"Hey, everybody.
"
,,
6,9,"Sure is swell of you to have me over.
"
,,
6,9,"What's for eats, Mrs. G?
"
,,
6,9,"Uh, meat loaf, Pe...I mean, Scooter.
"
,,
6,9,"I hope you like it.
"
,,
6,9,"Leapin' lizards, meat loaf is my favorite.
"
,,
6,9,"Scooter, how come we've never met you before?
"
,,
6,9,"Shut up, Meg.
"
,,
6,9,"You know, Scooter,
"
,,
6,9,"we don't allow hats at the dinner table.
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, my bad, Mr. G.Dad, no!
"
,,
6,9,"Aha! I should have known!
"
,,
6,9,"Get out of my house right now,
"
,,
6,9,"you son of a bitch.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, that's it, Brian.
"
,,
6,9,"I guess he's won.
"
,,
6,9,"I guess he's Peter Griffin now.
"
,,
6,9,"Wait a minute, Peter.
"
,,
6,9,"If he's Peter Griffin,
"
,,
6,9,"then that means you can be James Woods.
"
,,
6,9,"That's a great idea, Brian.
"
,,
6,9,"If I was a famous movie star,
"
,,
6,9,"I wouldn't even want my family.
"
,,
6,9,"No, no, Peter,I'm saying
"
,,
6,9,"you can do to him what he did to you.
"
,,
6,9,"You can ruin him.
"
,,
6,9,"I'll do it, I'll be James Woods.
"
,,
6,9,"From this day forth,I am James Woods.
"
,,
6,9,"And I'll stick to that story,even if nobody believes it.
"
,,
6,9,"I'll tell you what nobody believes in  ghosts.
"
,,
6,9,"Where did Robinson Crusoe go
"
,,
6,9,"With Friday on Saturday night?
"
,,
6,9,"Damn.Play me off, Johnny.
"
,,
6,9,"You're probably wonderin' why he's in hell.
"
,,
6,9,"Johnny liked little boys.
"
,,
6,9,"The question is, Brian,
"
,,
6,9,"how am I gonna make people think I'm James Woods?
"
,,
6,9,"The same way he did, Peter.
"
,,
6,9,"Identity theft works both ways.
"
,,
6,9,"The first thing we're gonna do is get you a perfect fake I.D.
"
,,
6,9,"I know a guy who does good work.
"
,,
6,9,"You took a big risk coming here, man.
"
,,
6,9,"James Woods could be back any minute.
"
,,
6,9,"I know. How fast can you do it?
"
,,
6,9,"As fast as Spider-Man when he gets laid.
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
"
,,
6,9,"That's never happened to me before.
"
,,
6,9,"It's just... you're so attractive
"
,,
6,9,"and it's been a while.
"
,,
6,9,"I'gonna go.
"
,,
6,9,"You know, some people say that's good for your hair.
"
,,
6,9,"Welcome back to the, uh, program, ladies and gentlemen.
"
,,
6,9,"Please welcome our next guest, Mr. James Woods.
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, James.
"
,,
6,9,"Wait a minute, you're not James Woods.
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, I believe I am.
"
,,
6,9,"Driver's license,
"
,,
6,9,"Social Security card, American Express.
"
,,
6,9,"What the hell is he doing?
"
,,
6,9,"Wow, I guess you are James Woods.
"
,,
6,9,"So, uh, now, let me understand this,
"
,,
6,9,"what are you here to promote, James?
"
,,
6,9,"Well, Dave, I have a hilarious new movie
"
,,
6,9,"coming out on HBO next month.
"
,,
6,9,"It's all about 9-11.
"
,,
6,9,"he movie's called September 11, 2000-Fun.
"
,,
6,9,"No! No, no, no, no, no!
"
,,
6,9,"James, that sounds unbelievably offensive to Americans.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, you haven't heard what the movie's about.
"
,,
6,9,"I play a window washer who has just finished washing
"
,,
6,9,"the last window of the World Trade Center.
"
,,
6,9,"And then I turn around to get off the scaffold,
"
,,
6,9,"and what do you think I see coming?
"
,,
6,9,"A plane.
"
,,
6,9,"And I go ""Come on!""
"
,,
6,9,"You know, it-it's real,real old style comedy.
"
,,
6,9,"You know, it-it's like,it's like two pies in the face,
"
,,
6,9,"and one in a field in Pennsylvania.
"
,,
6,9,"James, I don't want to hear anymore about this.
"
,,
6,9,"And the voice of the plane is David Spade.
"
,,
6,9,"What?!
"
,,
6,9,"I would never work with David Spade!
"
,,
6,9,"That dwarf!
"
,,
6,9,"That skinny chicken!
"
,,
6,9,"Well, Brian, it's been a productive week.
"
,,
6,9,"I think I've successfully
"
,,
6,9,"destroyed James Woods' reputation.
"
,,
6,9,"Here it is.
"
,,
6,9,"Well, our top story continues to be
"
,,
6,9,"the fall of actor James Woods,
"
,,
6,9,"who almost overnight has gone
"
,,
6,9,"from America's most
"
,,
6,9,"beloved celebrity
"
,,
6,9,"to America's most hated pariah.
"
,,
6,9,"You're in a lot of trouble, Griffin! You!
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, no, sir.
"
,,
6,9,"You're Peter Griffin.
"
,,
6,9,"I'm James Woods.
"
,,
6,9,"You ruined my reputation.
"
,,
6,9,"And now you are gonna pay for it.
"
,,
6,9,"We're gonna settle this like men.
"
,,
6,9,"All right, we'll settle it like men.
"
,,
6,9,"But not here.
"
,,
6,9,"Meet me out in the alley in 20 minutes.
"
,,
6,9,"I'll be there.
"
,,
6,9,"You be there too, you little piece of stool.
"
,,
6,9,"All right, Peter, I'm here.
"
,,
6,9,"Where are you?
"
,,
6,9,"Ooh, a piece of candy.
"
,,
6,9,"Ooh, a piece of candy.
"
,,
6,9,"Ooh, a piece of candy.
"
,,
6,9,"Ooh, a piece of candy.
"
,,
6,9,"Ooh, a piece of candy.
"
,,
6,9,"Ooh, a piece of candy. Ooh, a piece of candy.
"
,,
6,9,"Ooh, a piece of candy.
"
,,
6,9,"Ooh, a piece of candy.
"
,,
6,9,"Okay, Brian, next time
"
,,
6,9,"let's remember this right away,
"
,,
6,9,"because he's done this twice.
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, Peter, we're so glad to have you back.
"
,,
6,9,"I missed you.
"
,,
6,9,"I missed you, too, Lois.
"
,,
6,9,"So, what happened to James Woods?
"
,,
6,9,"Oh, he's being examined by top men.
"
,,
6,9,"Who?
"
,,
6,9,"Top... men.
"
,,
6,10,"And now back to G.I. Jose.
"
,,
6,10,"Hey, guys, let's go swim
"
,,
6,10,"in the old quarry.
"
,,
6,10,"Yeah!
"
,,
6,10,"Wait a minute, kids.
"
,,
6,10,"Don't go swimming
"
,,
6,10,"in that quarry.
"
,,
6,10,"It's dangerous.
"
,,
6,10,"Wow, thanks, G.I. Jose.
"
,,
6,10,"Hey, you guys want to buy
"
,,
6,10,"some gum or cotton candy
"
,,
6,10,"or a stuffed animal?
"
,,
6,10,"How about an inflatable
"
,,
6,10,"mallet, huh?
"
,,
6,10,"This is fun.
"
,,
6,10,"You can hit your friend
"
,,
6,10,"on the head with it.
"
,,
6,10,"But don't hit him on
"
,,
6,10,"the head with it.
"
,,
6,10,"Yeah, thanks.
"
,,
6,10,"I don't really need
"
,,
6,10,"any of that stuff.
"
,,
6,10,"You got any dents
"
,,
6,10,"you need hammered out?
"
,,
6,10,"G.I. Jose
"
,,
6,10,"Good evening,
"
,,
6,10,"I'm Tom Tucker.
"
,,
6,10,"Coming up, important traffic
"
,,
6,10,"news that can't help you
"
,,
6,10,"because you're some place
"
,,
6,10,"where a TV is.
"
,,
6,10,"But first,
"
,,
6,10,"get ready, Quahog,
"
,,
6,10,"because Barry Manilow will
"
,,
6,10,"be performing this weekend
"
,,
6,10,"at the Quahog Performing Arts Center.
"
,,
6,10,"Barry Manilow.
"
,,
6,10,"What a joke.
"
,,
6,10,"So stupid.
"
,,
6,10,"And boring as hell.
"
,,
6,10,"Yeah, no kidding.
"
,,
6,10,"You couldn't pay me
"
,,
6,10,"to go to that thing.
"
,,
6,10,"Hey, you know what
"
,,
6,10,"we should do?
"
,,
6,10,"We should go just as a goof.
"
,,
6,10,"That'd be hilarious.
"
,,
6,10,"Yeah, just look at
"
,,
6,10,"all the idiots.
"
,,
6,10,"All the dumb ass
"
,,
6,10,"Manilow fans.

"
,,
6,10,"Yeah, the
"
,,
6,10,"opening's okay.
"
,,
6,10,"And I guess you can't
"
,,
6,10,"hate ""Copacabana.""
"
,,
6,10,"Yeah, if you're
"
,,
6,10,"in the right mood.
"
,,
6,10,"""Daybreak""
"
,,
6,10,"is a good song.
"
,,
6,10,"Oh, yeah.
"
,,
6,10,"That's a good song.

,,
6,10,"And I like

6,10,"You get what you get
"
,,
6,10,"when you go for it
"
,,
6,10,"And I'm ready to take
"
,,
6,10,"A chance again with you
"
,,
6,10,"Thank you.
"
,,
6,10,"Thank you very much.

"
,,
6,10,"Happy people pass my way
"
,,
6,10,"Looking in their eyes I see a memory
"
,,
6,10,"I never realized how happy you made me

,,
6,10,"Oh, Quagmire Oh...!
"
,,
6,10,"Well, you came and you gave without taking

,,
6,10,"And I need you today

,,
6,10,"Oh, Quagmire.

6,10,"God, he's so talented.

6,10,"You know he wrote all those
"
,,
6,10,"Kentucky Fried Chicken jingles.
"
,,
6,10,"I don't care for them.
"
,,
6,10,"Not after what happened to Foghorn Leghorn.
"
,,
6,10,"I say, I says on, what do we got brewing in here?
"
,,
6,10,"I was walking by when I picked up the smell
"
,,
6,10,"of 11 herbs and spice... agh!

6,10,"""It's with my other family.""

6,10,"So, Peter, any luck finding your wallet?
"
,,
6,10,"No, and it's getting to be a pain in the ass.
"
,,
6,10,"I got no money.
"
,,
6,10,"I couldn't even afford to get my hair cut yesterday.
"
,,
6,10,"That'll be five dollars.
"
,,
6,10,"Sorry, lost my wallet.
"
,,
6,10,"But I already cut your hair.
"
,,
6,10,"Yeah, well, guess there'snothing you can do about it now.

,,
6,10,"Uh, yes, I'd like to rent this copy of Garden State.
"
,,
6,10,"Okay, I'll just need a picture ID.
"
,,
6,10,"Oh, I don't have one.
"
,,
6,10,"I'll rentit then.
"
,,
6,10,"It could've been me.
"
,,
6,10,"Oh, my God, Peter,
"
,,
6,10,"your visa bill is $16,000!
"
,,
6,10,"Somebody's been using your credit card.
"
,,
6,10,"Didn't you cancel it when you lost your wallet?
"
,,
6,10,"I hear what you're saying, Lois,
"
,,
6,10,"but unlike my credit card,
"
,,
6,10,"I'm carrying a very low rate of interest.
"
,,
6,10,"Let me see that.
"
,,
6,10,"A big screen TV,a massage chair
"
,,
6,10,"from Sharper Image,plane tickets...
"
,,
6,10,"Peter, someone has obviously stolen your credit card.
"
,,
6,10,"Well, here's the good news, Brian.
"
,,
6,10,"Whoever the thief is, he's spending less
"
,,
6,10,"than my wife.
"
,,
6,10,"Wait, look at this.
"
,,
6,10,"He eats at House of Chungevery day.
"
,,
6,10,"House of Chung, huh?
"
,,
6,10,"Come on, let's go, Brian.
"
,,
6,10,"The place is packed.
"
,,
6,10,"How are we gonna figure out who has your credit card?
"
,,
6,10,"I got it, Brian. Smell my ass.
"
,,
6,10,"What? Smell my ass.
"
,,
6,10,"It's where I keep my wallet.
"
,,
6,10,"Get the scent and then find the guy that smells like me.
"
,,
6,10,"Peter, that'sridiculous.
"
,,
6,10,"Come on, boy, get the scent.
"
,,
6,10,"Cut it out! Get a good sniff.
"
,,
6,10,"That's disgusting.
"
,,
6,10,"You're an idiot, you know that?
"
,,
6,10,"Wait a minute.
"
,,
6,10,"Your wallet's
"
,,
6,10,"Oh, my God, it's you!
"
,,
6,10,"James Woods.
"
,,
6,10,"Hello, Peter.
"
,,
6,10,"I've been expecting you.
"
,,
6,10,"You stole my credit card, you son of a bitch.
"
,,
6,10,"What did I ever do to you?
"
,,
6,10,"That's a good question, Peter.
"
,,
6,10,"What did you ever do to me, hmm?
"
,,
6,10,"What did you ever do to James Woods?
"
,,
6,10,"Well, I locked you in a wooden crate
"
,,
6,10,"and forgot to put an air hole in it.
"
,,
6,10,"Forgot to put an air hole in it.
"
,,
6,10,"Well, you kind ofhad it coming.
"
,,
6,10,"Look, Mr. Woods, just give Peter back his wallet.
"
,,
6,10,"Oh, no, Brian.
"
,,
6,10,"I'm just getting started.
"
,,
6,10,"Peter, you humiliated me.
"
,,
6,10,"You put me through hell.
"
,,
6,10,"And now you're gonna pay for it.
"
,,
6,10,"So get ready...
"
,,
6,10,"fatso.
"
,,
6,10,"Lois, we found the guy who stole my wallet.
"
,,
6,10,"You'll never guess who it was.
"
,,
6,10,"James Woods?
"
,,
6,10,"Hello, stranger.
"
,,
6,10,"I don't recall inviting you into my home.
"
,,
6,10,"Peter, he's been here for four hours.
"
,,
6,10,"I told him to leave, but he keeps saying he lives here.
"
,,
6,10,"I say, this is more uncomfortable
"
,,
6,10,"than having James Brady at a cocktail party.
"
,,
6,10,"Right, so I got my hand gun
"
,,
6,10,"and I'm just randomly firing it into a crowd of people
"
,,
6,10,"and then...
"
,,
6,10,"And then what?
"
,,
6,10,"And nothing. Nothing.
"
,,
6,10,"No, no, I'm anxious to hear
"
,,
6,10,"the conclusion of your story.
"
,,
6,10,"Ah, it's stupid.
"
,,
6,10,"Stupid story.
"
,,
6,10,"I'm calling the police.
"
,,
6,10,"That won't be necessary.
"
,,
6,10,"I already did.
"
,,
6,10,"Hello, Officer. Would you be kind enough
"
,,
6,10,"to remove this trespasser from my home?
"
,,
6,10,"What are you talking about? This is my house.
"
,,
6,10,"No, this house belongs to Peter Griffin.
"
,,
6,10,"And that's me.
"
,,
6,10,"Hmm... driver's license,
"
,,
6,10,"Social Security card, passport,title to the house.
"
,,
6,10,"This puts me in a tough spot.
"
,,
6,10,"Joe, you can't possibly believe this.
"
,,
6,10,"You know who Peter is.
"
,,
6,10,"I know, Lois, but this man has all the paperwork.
"
,,
6,10,"Oh, come on,this is identity theft.
"
,,
6,10,"I hate to have to do this,
"
,,
6,10,"but I'm afraid legally I have no choice.
"
,,
6,10,"I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, sir.
"
,,
6,10,"Thanks, Joe.
"
,,
6,10,"Clam later? We'll hoist a few?
"
,,
6,10,"Sure, Peter.Joe!
"
,,
6,10,"Hey, not so fast, pal.
"
,,
6,10,"Those are my clothes.
"
,,
6,10,"Oh, come on. You heard him, fella.
"
,,
6,10,"Take 'em off. Right down to the poop sack.
"
,,
6,10,"What?
"
,,
6,10,"You don't all weara poop sack?
"
,,
6,10,"Damn it, Bonnie!
"
,,
6,10,"You lied to me about the poop sack!
"
,,
6,10,"Hello, family.
"
,,
6,10,"Hello, honey.
"
,,
6,10,"Oh, schnoopy...
"
,,
6,10,"Stop calling me that.
"
,,
6,10,"I don't care what the law says,
"
,,
6,10,"you're not Peter Griffin, you're James Woods.
"
,,
6,10,"I should've warned you,
"
,,
6,10,"she can be a real bitch in the morning.
"
,,
6,10,"Mom, this is really weird.
"
,,
6,10,"I want Dad back. I don't.
"
,,
6,10,"Having a celebrity dad is a real thrill.
"
,,
6,10,"Not like the fake thrill
"
,,
6,10,"of running into your ex-girlfriend on the street.
"
,,
6,10,"Rob?
"
,,
6,10,"Hey!
"
,,
6,10,"Hey! How are you?
"
,,
6,10,"God, it's good to see you.
"
,,
6,10,"Good to see you, too.
"
,,
6,10,"How's my dog?
"
,,
6,10,"I'm sorry, your dog?
"
,,
6,10,"Oh, I had to give him away.
"
,,
6,10,"Gave him away!
"
,,
6,10,"Well, Dave's allergic. Dave!
"
,,
6,10,"All right, so there's a Dave.
"
,,
6,10,"That's great. God, Dave sounds great.
"
,,
6,10,"Yeah, he is.
"
,,
6,10,"And his parents are so sweet.
"
,,
6,10,"Ah, met his parents and they're sweet.
"
,,
6,10,"Just older Daves, huh?
"
,,
6,10,"What a family. God, it's good to see you.
"
,,
6,10,"You won't get away with this, Woods.
"
,,
6,10,"You know, you're not supposed to be in the house, Brian.
"
,,
6,10,"You're more of an outdoor dog.
"
,,
6,10,"What the hell does that mean?
"
,,
6,10,"This is so humiliating.
"
,,
6,10,"For God's sake, I went to Brown
"
,,
6,10,"and he's got me out here tied to a post like some kind...
"
,,
6,10,"What the hell?
"
,,
6,10,"This rope was a lot longer, and now it's somehow gotten shorter.
"
,,
6,10,"What sort of black magic is this?
"
,,
6,10,"Brian, guess what?
"
,,
6,10,"I gave James Woods your novel to read,
"
,,
6,10,"and you're not gonna believe this.
"
,,
6,10,"Really? Did he like it?
"
,,
6,10,"He wants to option it and make a movie!
"
,,
6,10,"Really?
"
,,
6,10,"No, he didn't really
"
,,
6,10,"respond to it. Oh.
"
,,
6,10,"Listen, I need your help.
"
,,
6,10,"Run inside and get me a pair of scissors.
"
,,
6,10,"Okay. I just hope I don't get distracted.
"
,,
6,10,"I am a baby, after all.
"
,,
6,10,"Ooh, look, a brightly colored dish towel!
"
,,
6,10,"What did I come in here for?
"
,,
6,10,"Brian, what are you doing tied to Meg's pole?
"
,,
6,10,"James Woods did it.
"
,,
6,10,"Hey, where'd you get the clothes?
"
,,
6,10,"I always keep a spare at Quagmire's.
"
,,
6,10,"I gotta tell you though,
"
,,
6,10,"there was some weird stuff going on over there today.
"
,,
6,10,"Hey, Quagmire can I...?Hang-Hang on a second.
"
,,
6,10,"And that's why I contend
"
,,
6,10,"that when Frost speaks of birch trees,
"
,,
6,10,"he may very well be talking about himself.
"
,,
6,10,"No, Glenn, that's not...Gloria, please.
"
,,
6,10,"You wanna hear my interpretation,
"
,,
6,10,"or are you simply going to tell me that I'm wrong?
"
,,
6,10,"I'm simply pointing out...
"
,,
6,10,"Yes. We know, you'r every well read.
"
,,
6,10,"But this is poetry we're talking about,
"
,,
6,10,"and I think when it comes to poetry, you can't be wrong.
"
,,
6,10,"What Peter?!
"
,,
6,10,"Nothing, nothing. Sorry to interrupt.
"
,,
6,10,"The cedars represent society.
"
,,
6,10,"Sorry to interrupt.
"
,,
6,10,"Listen, you gotta get out of here.
"
,,
6,10,"If James Woods sees you, he's gonna call the cops.
"
,,
6,10,"I miss my family, Brian,
"
,,
6,10,"and I gotta see 'em.
"
,,
6,10,"Well, well.
"
,,
6,10,"A trespasser on my property.
"
,,
6,10,"That's the worst thing that'shappened to me since...
"
,,
6,10,"You wouldn't!
"
,,
6,10,"It's up to you, Peter.
"
,,
6,10,"Either you leave now...
"
,,
6,10,"or I set up one of your random flashbacks.
"
,,
6,10,"All right, all right,all right, okay.
"
,,
6,10,"Peter, what do you care...?
"
,,
6,10,"No, no, Brian, he's serious.
"
,,
6,10,"I'll come back for you, Lois.
"
,,
6,10,"And I'll set up all the flashbacks, just like I used to.
"
,,
6,10,"Like the time I swallowed that midget
"
,,
6,10,"who played Mini-Me just so I could make you laugh.
"
,,
6,10,"You ready for dinner, Peter?
"
,,
6,10,"Oh, yeah. In fact...
"
,,
6,10,"my stomach has been talking to me all day.
"
,,
6,10,"I said my stomach has been talking to me all day.
"
,,
6,10,"Come on, say the line.
"
,,
6,10,"Oh, oh, there he is.
"
,,
6,10,"You know what, he slipped into my colon.
"
,,
6,10,"Yeah, oh, damn it, he's smothered.
"
,,
6,10,"Uh, but-but, let... just,lemme just ask you this, Lois-
"
,,
6,10,"if my stomach had said,""Hell yeah I'm hungry.
"
,,
6,10,"How 'bout some pork chops?""
"
,,
6,10,"Would you have thought that was funny?
"
,,
6,10,"Eh, not really.
"
,,
6,10,"Ah. Well, then, this has been an absolute misfire.
"
,,
6,10,"Oh, this is just awful.
"
,,
6,10,"James Woods is destroying this family,
"
,,
6,10,"and all just to get back at Peter.
"
,,
6,10,"I know, he's doing all the stuff Dad usually does.
"
,,
6,10,"Right now he's upstairs talking to Meg.
"
,,
6,10,"Now, Meg, you want to be thin
"
,,
6,10,"like all the Hollywood starlets, right?
"
,,
6,10,"Yeah, but I love to eat.
"
,,
6,10,"Well, I've got a way that you can eat all you want
"
,,
6,10,"and look like a Hollywood starlet.
"
,,
6,10,"Meg, let me introduce you to Mr. Pukey.
"
,,
6,10,"Hiya, Meg.Hi.
"
,,
6,10,"Gosh, Mr. Pukey,
"
,,
6,10,"you sure are good at making fat women hot.
"
,,
6,10,"Wow, thanks.
"
,,
6,10,"You think you could help out my friend Meg here?
"
,,
6,10,"Yeah, I think I could give her a... hand.
"
,,
6,10,"Now close your eyes, Meg,
"
,,
6,10,"and let Mr. Pukey help you out.
"
,,
6,10,"When did Reese Witherspoon get here?
"
,,
6,10,"Mr. Woods, how do I get a girl to like me?
"
,,
6,10,"Oh, Chris, I'm your father.
"
,,
6,10,"Call me Dad.
"
,,
6,10,"Um, okay... Dad.
"
,,
6,10,"How do I geta girl to like me?
"
,,
6,10,"Well, there's a number of ways, Chris.
"
,,
6,10,"Uh, for example, uh,Kate Moss and I
"
,,
6,10,"had the same coke supplier,
"
,,
6,10,"and he threw a punch social one day
"
,,
6,10,"and we both happened to be there.
"
,,
6,10,"Next thing you know,
"
,,
6,10,"we're both in the back room, slam-bang.
"
,,
6,10,"I went bareback.
"
,,
6,10,"Wow, she sounds like assla act.
"
,,
6,10,"Oh, not at all, Chris. No, not at all.
"
,,
6,10,"Thanks, Dad. I feel better.
"
,,
6,10,"Off I go on my merry way
"
,,
6,10,"Life is great and I'm happy with my dad.
"
,,
6,10,"What am I gonna do, Brian?
"
,,
6,10,"James Woods has taken my life and my family.
"
,,
6,10,"I know, Peter,but identity theft
"
,,
6,10,"is one of the hardest things to fight.
"
,,
6,10,"How you gonna handle it?
"
,,
6,10,"I don't know, Brian.
"
,,
6,10,"All I know is, I sure do miss Lois.
"
,,
6,10,"I gotta find a way to see her.
"
,,
6,10,"And I think I just got an idea.
"
,,
6,10,"A much better idea than when I did magic for the blind.
"
,,
6,10,"Is this your card?
"
,,
6,10,"I don't know.
"
,,
6,10,"Was it a red card?
"
,,
6,10,"I don't know what red is.
"
,,
6,10,"Ta-da.
"
,,
6,10,"You know what's amazing, Lois?
"
,,
6,10,"A week from tomorrow,
"
,,
6,10,"it'll be 20 years we've been married.
"
,,
6,10,"I married Peter Griffin, you lunatic!
"
,,
6,10,"Uh, hello.I was there, see?
"
,,
6,10,"Hi, everyone. Sorry I'm late.
"
,,
6,10,"I brought friend home for dinner.
"
,,
6,10,"Mom... Dad...
"
,,
6,10,"This is Scooter.
"
,,
6,10,"Uh... hello, Scooter.
"
,,
6,10,"Hey, everybody.
"
,,
6,10,"Sure is swell of you to have me over.
"
,,
6,10,"What's for eats, Mrs. G?
"
,,
6,10,"Uh, meat loaf, Pe...I mean, Scooter.
"
,,
6,10,"I hope you like it.
"
,,
6,10,"Leapin' lizards, meat loaf is my favorite.
"
,,
6,10,"Scooter, how come we've never met you before?
"
,,
6,10,"Shut up, Meg.
"
,,
6,10,"You know, Scooter,
"
,,
6,10,"we don't allow hats at the dinner table.
"
,,
6,10,"Oh, my bad, Mr. G.Dad, no!
"
,,
6,10,"Aha! I should have known!
"
,,
6,10,"Get out of my house right now,
"
,,
6,10,"you son of a bitch.
"
,,
6,10,"Well, that's it, Brian.
"
,,
6,10,"I guess he's won.
"
,,
6,10,"I guess he's Peter Griffin now.
"
,,
6,10,"Wait a minute, Peter.
"
,,
6,10,"If he's Peter Griffin,
"
,,
6,10,"then that means you can be James Woods.
"
,,
6,10,"That's a great idea, Brian.
"
,,
6,10,"If I was a famous movie star,
"
,,
6,10,"I wouldn't even want my family.
"
,,
6,10,"No, no, Peter,I'm saying
"
,,
6,10,"you can do to him what he did to you.
"
,,
6,10,"You can ruin him.
"
,,
6,10,"I'll do it, I'll be James Woods.
"
,,
6,10,"From this day forth,I am James Woods.
"
,,
6,10,"And I'll stick to that story,even if nobody believes it.
"
,,
6,10,"I'll tell you what nobody believes in  ghosts.
"
,,
6,10,"Where did Robinson Crusoe go
"
,,
6,10,"With Friday on Saturday night?
"
,,
6,10,"Damn.Play me off, Johnny.
"
,,
6,10,"You're probably wonderin' why he's in hell.
"
,,
6,10,"Johnny liked little boys.
"
,,
6,10,"The question is, Brian,
"
,,
6,10,"how am I gonna make people think I'm James Woods?
"
,,
6,10,"The same way he did, Peter.
"
,,
6,10,"Identity theft works both ways.
"
,,
6,10,"The first thing we're gonna do is get you a perfect fake I.D.
"
,,
6,10,"I know a guy who does good work.
"
,,
6,10,"You took a big risk coming here, man.
"
,,
6,10,"James Woods could be back any minute.
"
,,
6,10,"I know. How fast can you do it?
"
,,
6,10,"As fast as Spider-Man when he gets laid.
"
,,
6,10,"Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
"
,,
6,10,"That's never happened to me before.
"
,,
6,10,"It's just... you're so attractive
"
,,
6,10,"and it's been a while.
"
,,
6,10,"I'gonna go.
"
,,
6,10,"You know, some people say that's good for your hair.
"
,,
6,10,"Welcome back to the, uh, program, ladies and gentlemen.
"
,,
6,10,"Please welcome our next guest, Mr. James Woods.
"
,,
6,10,"Oh, James.
"
,,
6,10,"Wait a minute, you're not James Woods.
"
,,
6,10,"Oh, I believe I am.
"
,,
6,10,"Driver's license,
"
,,
6,10,"Social Security card, American Express.
"
,,
6,10,"What the hell is he doing?
"
,,
6,10,"Wow, I guess you are James Woods.
"
,,
6,10,"So, uh, now, let me understand this,
"
,,
6,10,"what are you here to promote, James?
"
,,
6,10,"Well, Dave, I have a hilarious new movie
"
,,
6,10,"coming out on HBO next month.
"
,,
6,10,"It's all about 9-11.
"
,,
6,10,"he movie's called September 11, 2000-Fun.
"
,,
6,10,"No! No, no, no, no, no!
"
,,
6,10,"James, that sounds unbelievably offensive to Americans.
"
,,
6,10,"Well, you haven't heard what the movie's about.
"
,,
6,10,"I play a window washer who has just finished washing
"
,,
6,10,"the last window of the World Trade Center.
"
,,
6,10,"And then I turn around to get off the scaffold,
"
,,
6,10,"and what do you think I see coming?
"
,,
6,10,"A plane.
"
,,
6,10,"And I go ""Come on!""
"
,,
6,10,"You know, it-it's real,real old style comedy.
"
,,
6,10,"You know, it-it's like,it's like two pies in the face,
"
,,
6,10,"and one in a field in Pennsylvania.
"
,,
6,10,"James, I don't want to hear anymore about this.
"
,,
6,10,"And the voice of the plane is David Spade.
"
,,
6,10,"What?!
"
,,
6,10,"I would never work with David Spade!
"
,,
6,10,"That dwarf!
"
,,
6,10,"That skinny chicken!
"
,,
6,10,"Well, Brian, it's been a productive week.
"
,,
6,10,"I think I've successfully
"
,,
6,10,"destroyed James Woods' reputation.

6,11,"All right, Dylan.You know what?
"
,,
6,11,"This isn't working out Alrit? don't carethat I'm your father,
"
,,
6,11,"and you don't care
"
,,
6,11,"that you're my son.
"
,,
6,11,"We don't have anything
"
,,
6,11,"in common.
"
,,
6,11,"I think it's best if you
"
,,
6,11,"just get out of this house.
"
,,
6,11,"Fine. I hated you anyhow.
"
,,
6,11,"Get out of my way.
"
,,
6,11," My pot!
"
,,
6,11," My pot!
"
,,
6,11," Your pot?
"
,,
6,11," Your pot?
"
,,
6,11,"And then in chapter 28 of my novel,
"
,,
6,11,"the other pilots finally
"
,,
6,11,"trust the Japanese
"
,,
6,11,"pilot and let him, let him into...
"
,,
6,11,"their group.
"
,,
6,11,"Dude, that is an amazing story.
"
,,
6,11,"Hey. Hey, what if, um,
"
,,
6,11,"there were a Korean pilot?
"
,,
6,11,"Yeah. Um, I'm not really
"
,,
6,11,"looking for notes,
"
,,
6,11,"but you know, Dylan, I gotta
"
,,
6,11,"tell you something.
"
,,
6,11,"I'm sorry I wasn't around
"
,,
6,11,"when you were growing up.
"
,,
6,11,"Don't. Just, just don't.
"
,,
6,11,"If-if I had known having
"
,,
6,11,"a son could be like this...
"
,,
6,11," How dare you?
"
,,
6,11," I didn't know!
"
,,
6,11,"You had no right, man.
"
,,
6,11,"No right.
"
,,
6,11," It wasn't my fault.
"
,,
6,11," You weren't there for me.
"
,,
6,11,"Damn it, don't you think I wanted to be?
"
,,
6,11,"Shh. Shh.
"
,,
6,11,"It's okay.
"
,,
6,11,"It's okay.
"
,,
6,11,"Look, I know I wasn't there
"
,,
6,11,"for you man,
"
,,
6,11,"for all those years,
"
,,
6,11,"but...that's gonna change.
"
,,
6,11,"It's gonna be different
"
,,
6,11,"from now on.
"
,,
6,11,"And I'm gonna make you
"
,,
6,11,"into a better person,
"
,,
6,11,"starting first thing tomorrow.
"
,,
6,11,"Just passing through.
"
,,
6,11,"See anything you like, speak up.
"
,,
6,11,"Hey, there, everybody.
"
,,
6,11,"Was somebody looking for a son
"
,,
6,11,"with a bright new path to
"
,,
6,11,"adulthood and his very,
"
,,
6,11,"very proud Dad?
"
,,
6,11,"Oh, Dylan, you got a haircut.
"
,,
6,11,"Aren't you handsome?
"
,,
6,11,"From now on, I plan on being
"
,,
6,11,"a real father to Dylan,
"
,,
6,11,"and together,
"
,,
6,11,"we are gonna turn his life around.
"
,,
6,11,"Right champ?
"
,,
6,11,"You said it, Dad.
"
,,
6,11,"All right! You ready for school?
"
,,
6,11,"Yeah. Hey, can I drive today?
"
,,
6,11,"Oh, this kid!
"
,,
6,11,"He's only 13.
"
,,
6,11,"I know.
"
,,
6,11,"I was just kidding.
"
,,
6,11,"Oh. We got a young Adam
"
,,
6,11,"Sandler here, I think.
"
,,
6,11,"Right?
"
,,
6,11," Right?
"
,,
6,11," Yes.
"
,,
6,11," Bye, Mom.
"
,,
6,11," Bye!
"
,,
6,11,"All right, kids.
"
,,
6,11,"Have a good day at school.
"
,,
6,11,"Hey, Dylan.
"
,,
6,11,"Have a great day at school.
"
,,
6,11,"Thanks, Dad.
"
,,
6,11,"Hey. Knock-knock.
"
,,
6,11,"Who's there?
"
,,
6,11,"You're there.
"
,,
6,11,"I'll always be there, Dylan.

6,11,"Most of this stuff is price to move
"

6,11,"and until it does, it's
"
,,
6,11,"an enormous fire hazard,
"
,,
6,11,"so please, come see me,
"
,,
6,11,"on Route 2 in Weekapaug.
"
,,
6,11,"Look for the Sort-of Ben and
"
,,
6,11,"Jerry's Cow out front!
"
,,
6,11,"We interrupt this program to bring
"
,,
6,11,"you grim news out of
"
,,
6,11,"LaGuardia airport, where a 767 has been
"
,,
6,11,"forced to make a crash landing.
"
,,
6,11,"Oh, man, I tell you,
"
,,
6,11,"now that I'm a parent,
"
,,
6,11,"I can't even watch stories like that.
"
,,
6,11,"I just think, you know, I just think,
"
,,
6,11,"""Oh, my God, what if
"
,,
6,11,"Dylan were on that plane?""
"
,,
6,11,"Oh, my God, oh, I just
"
,,
6,11,"don't know what I would do.
"
,,
6,11,"I don't know what I would do.
"
,,
6,11,"Yeah, yeah, I understand.
"
,,
6,11,"That'd be tough.
"
,,
6,11,"Oh, oh, no.
"
,,
6,11,"Oh, no.
"
,,
6,11,"No, no.
"
,,
6,11,"No, no, no.
"
,,
6,11,"Quagmire, no.
"
,,
6,11,"You do not understand.
"
,,
6,11,"Until you have a child...
"
,,
6,11,"Until you have a child,
"
,,
6,11,"you do not understand. Okay?
"
,,
6,11,"Damn it.
"
,,
6,11,"It's been like this all week.
"
,,
6,11,"Watch this: Hey, Brian,
"
,,
6,11,"what would you
"
,,
6,11,"do if Dylan fell out a window?
"
,,
6,11,"Oh, my God. Oh, my God I don't
"
,,
6,11,"even want to think about that.
"
,,
6,11,"I don't even want to think about that.
"
,,
6,11,"Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, no.
"
,,
6,11,"Brian, what would you do
"
,,
6,11,"if Dylan was in a fire?
"
,,
6,11,"Oh, my God. Oh, no. Oh, my God. Oh, that's...
"
,,
6,11,"Oh, God. Oh, no, no,no.
"
,,
6,11,"Knock on wood.
"
,,
6,11,"Knock on wood, Knock on wood.
"
,,
6,11,"Oh, I can't hear any more of this.
"
,,
6,11,"Peter, your dog is giving me diabetes.
"
,,
6,11,"Oh, boy, you're not kidding.
"
,,
6,11,"I tell you, I wish
"
,,
6,11,"that old hag of Brian's
"
,,
6,11,"had never even told him he had a kid.
"
,,
6,11,"Well, wait a minute, Peter.
"
,,
6,11,"Maybe that's the answer.
"
,,
6,11,"You just gotta get his
"
,,
6,11,"mother take him back.
"
,,
6,11,"How the hell am I supposed to do that?
"
,,
6,11,"She's an idiot redneck, Peter.
"
,,
6,11,"Tricking her should be easier than
"
,,
6,11,"escaping from Canadian Alcatraz.
"
,,
6,11,"Can I go through here?
"
,,
6,11,"Just be back by bedtime.
"
,,
6,11,"Okay.
"
,,
6,11,"Lunch is ready, everyone.
"
,,
6,11,"Whoa, whoa, whoa,whoa. Lois, Lois.
"
,,
6,11,"This is, this is white bread.
"
,,
6,11,"Yeah. So?
"
,,
6,11,"Well, don't we have any of
"
,,
6,11,"that whole-grain stuff?
"
,,
6,11,"No. This was cheaper.
"
,,
6,11,"I just, I just, I don't want
"
,,
6,11,"Dylan eating white bread.
"
,,
6,11,"Brian, there's nothing wrong with it.
"
,,
6,11,"Lois, Lois, I do not want
"
,,
6,11,"Dylan eating white bread.
"
,,
6,11,"Brian, I promise you, it's fine.
"
,,
6,11,"Lois. Lois, Lois I will decide what
"
,,
6,11,"is best for my child, all right?
"
,,
6,11,"Look, will you take it easy?
"
,,
6,11,"And, and, I do not want to have
"
,,
6,11,"this conversation in front of my son.
"
,,
6,11,"Okay, you know what?
"
,,
6,11,"That's it, Brian.
"
,,
6,11,"Feed him whatever you want.
"
,,
6,11,"Tell, tell you what.
"
,,
6,11,"Go up to my jewelry box,
"
,,
6,11,"take my gold jewelry.
"
,,
6,11,"Melt it down.
"
,,
6,11,"Make it into bread
"
,,
6,11,"and feed him that.
"
,,
6,11,"That good enough?
"
,,
6,11,"Gold bread good enough
"
,,
6,11,"for your Dylan?!
"
,,
6,11,"Hey, everybody!
"
,,
6,11,"Look at who's back
"
,,
6,11,"to pick up her son.
"
,,
6,11,"This isn't The Price is Right.
"
,,
6,11,"You said we were going
"
,,
6,11,"to The Price is Right.
"
,,
6,11,"Peter. What the hell is this?
"
,,
6,11,"Mom. What are you doing here?
"
,,
6,11,"Tracy wants Dylan back.
"
,,
6,11,"Don't you want Dylan back, Tracy?
"
,,
6,11,"What a joyous family reunion.
"
,,
6,11,"Isn't this great, Brian?
"
,,
6,11,"Now Dylan can go back with his mom,
"
,,
6,11,"and you can stop acting like
"
,,
6,11,"such a jackass.
"
,,
6,11,"So that's what this is all about, huh?
"
,,
6,11,"I must say, you have been a little
"
,,
6,11,"insufferable lately, Brian.
"
,,
6,11,"We just want the old you
"
,,
6,11,"back, that's all.
"
,,
6,11,"Look. All right. Okay, maybe I have
"
,,
6,11,"been acting different lately,
"
,,
6,11,"all right?
"
,,
6,11,"But that's only because I've truly
"
,,
6,11,"connected with the one bit of
"
,,
6,11,"flesh and blood that
"
,,
6,11,"I have on this earth.
"
,,
6,11,"And I have no intention
"
,,
6,11,"of giving that up.
"
,,
6,11,"Who wants a half-and-half?
"
,,
6,11,"Oh, I'll throw my hat into that ring.
"
,,
6,11,"Wait a minute, Dad.
"
,,
6,11,"I think maybe I should
"
,,
6,11,"go with her.
"
,,
6,11,"What? Dylan, why?
"
,,
6,11,"Look at her.
"
,,
6,11,"She needs me-
"
,,
6,11,"a lot more than you do.
"
,,
6,11,"But we were just starting
"
,,
6,11,"to make a real connection.
"
,,
6,11,"Listen.
"
,,
6,11,"I'll always be grateful to you for
"
,,
6,11,"turning my life around, but
"
,,
6,11,"now, thanks to you, I finally
"
,,
6,11,"have a chance to transform
"
,,
6,11,"my mom's life in the same way
"
,,
6,11,"you transformed mine.
"
,,
6,11,"You know, I guess a dad couldn't
"
,,
6,11,"ask for more than that.
"
,,
6,11,"I'm proud of you, Dylan.
"
,,
6,11,"My life will never be the
"
,,
6,11,"same for knowing you.
"
,,
6,11,"Good-bye and...
"
,,
6,11,"good luck.
"
,,
6,11,"Good-bye, Dad.
"
,,
6,11,"Come on, Mom. Let's go.
"
,,
6,11,"Bye. Thanks for coming.
"
,,
6,11,"I'm gonna miss that boy.
"
,,
6,11,"You know, I just finally
"
,,
6,11,"figured it out.
"
,,
6,11,"She looks like a really
"
,,
6,11,"hot Tim Russert.
"
,,
6,11,"Right?
"
,,
6,11," Right?
"
,,
6,11," Yes.

6,12,"Lois, will you make up the guestroom?

6,12,"Peter, that's someones pet.
"
,,
6,12,"You can't just take it.
"

6,12,"Well, maybe they never know it's gone.
"
,,
6,12,"Oh, Brian. I'm so glad you're ok.
"
,,
6,12,"Yes, he's doing fine.
"
,,
6,12,"We were able to clear the stomach obstruction.
"

6,12,"I was wondering if you're free for coffee.
"
,,
6,12,"Oh, no, I can't!
"
,,
6,12,"I've got a lunch meeting and
"
,,
6,12,"then a meeting after lunch.
"
,,
6,12,"After that...
"
,,
6,12,"Over the next 90 minutes...
"
,,
6,12,"I'd like to show you that all your
"
,,
6,12,"problems can be solved by my penis.
"
,,
6,12,"Hey guys.
"
,,
6,12,"What is going on?
"
,,
6,12," No way!
"
,,
6,12," Coool!
"
,,
6,12,"That thing don't bite, do it?
"
,,
6,12,"Guys, say hello to Adrien Beaky.
"
,,
6,12,"Ehehe. Ain't that funny?
"
,,
6,12,"He heard me say that on the way over in the cab.
"
,,
6,12,"W-Wait, we had the radio on and we
"
,,
6,12,"were talking about some goofy stuff.
"
,,
6,12,"So, what, what are you guys drinking?
"
,,
6,12,"Hey Peter, you kind of look like a pirat
"
,,
6,12,"with that thing on your shoulder.
"
,,
6,12,"A Pirat?
"
,,
6,12,"Ah, cool.
"
,,
6,12,"You should get a pirat name.
"
,,
6,12,"And a peg-leg.
"
,,
6,12,"And a hook-hand.
"
,,
6,12,"And you should have sex with that crossing guard,
"
,,
6,12,"even though she looked young
"
,,
6,12,"and then i found out she was 12.
"
,,
6,12,"I mean, you should get an eye patch.
"
,,
6,12,"Eye patch would be cool.
"
,,
6,12,"Mom, can we go back to the vet and
"
,,
6,12,"see the pretty vet assistant again?
"
,,
6,12,"Well, I guess if Brian get sick again.
"
,,
6,12,"Oh, boy!
"
,,
6,12,"Hey Brian, look!
"
,,
6,12,"Brian's sick.
"
,,
6,12,"Mom, get your keys!
"
,,
6,12,"Chris, I'm not going to the vet.
"
,,
6,12,"Haha. There's me wench.
"
,,
6,12,"Peter, what the hell are you doing?
"
,,
6,12,"That's Long John Peter to you, Porthole.
"
,,
6,12,"Fetch me five tankards of ale
"
,,
6,12,"and a leg of mutton for me maties!
"
,,
6,12,"Who the hell are those guys?
"
,,
6,12,"Just a few sea dogs from my fishin' boat days.
"
,,
6,12,"I don't care who they are.
"
,,
6,12,"They stink.
"
,,
6,12,"Get 'em out of here!
"
,,
6,12,"They stink of good cheer, Lois.
"
,,
6,12,"After we've had our fill of bread and wine,
"
,,
6,12,"we shall tell tales of other times we had
"
,,
6,12,"our fill of bread and wine.
"
,,
6,12,"God, this is a more disturbing sight
"
,,
6,12,"then Tom Hanks and E.T. in Philadelphia.
"
,,
6,12,"Ouch...
"
,,
6,12,"Here you go, you're good.
"
,,
6,12,"You didn't touch me.
"
,,
6,12,"I don't wanna to get AIDS.
"
,,
6,12,"Ahhhh, Kristallnacht!
"
,,
6,12,"Ahaaa. 'Tis Long John Peter and
"
,,
6,12,"his merry men come seeking plunder.
"
,,
6,12,"All your Tuck's Medicated Pads be ours.
"
,,
6,12,"Ahh! Oh my God!
"
,,
6,12,"Oh, Dod, why are you doing this!?
"
,,
6,12,"Ahaaa.
"
,,
6,12,"For no reason.
"
,,
6,12,"I'm going to fire this canon all over your store.
"
,,
6,12,"Hahahahaha.
"
,,
6,12,"Ahaaa. Terrible pharmacy toys.
"
,,
6,12,"We'll see to it that no child ever received these
"
,,
6,12,"as a last minute gift hastily
"
,,
6,12,"bought on the way to the party.
"
,,
6,12,"Dear me, it's almost 3 o' clock.
"
,,
6,12,"I've got to get this shipment of sugarcane,
"
,,
6,12,"tobacco and spices to the harbor before day's end.
"
,,
6,12,"That car is coming up awfully fast.
"
,,
6,12,"But at least it's flying the British Flag.
"
,,
6,12,"Oh, no. Privateers.
"
,,
6,12,"No doubt. They're after my
"
,,
6,12,"sugarcane, tobacco and spices.
"
,,
6,12,"Well, Shelley Booth bishop isn't
"
,,
6,12,"about to let you over-egg this pudding.
"
,,
6,12,"Prepare to be boarded.
"
,,
6,12,"You'll never take my cargo.
"
,,
6,12,"Load the cannon.
"
,,
6,12,"All clear, sir.
"
,,
6,12,"Shootitagain.
"
,,
6,12,"What? I didn't understand that.
"
,,
6,12,"I said, shoot it again.
"
,,
6,12,"But I said it pirate like.
"
,,
6,12,"Well done, you barnacle-munchings-callywiggers.
"
,,
6,12,"Sir, we've got a man down.
"
,,
6,12,"Oh my God! Adrien Beaky.
"
,,
6,12,"Say something.
"
,,
6,12,"Oh god, this is my fault.
"
,,
6,12,"I did this!
"
,,
6,12,"I've screwed up worse than Disney did
"
,,
6,12,"when they cast Michael J.
"
,,
6,12,"Fox in that Zorro remake.
"
,,
6,12,"Who was that masked man who saved us?
"
,,
6,12,"I dont' know.
"
,,
6,12,"But he left his insignia.
"
,,
6,12,"Give it to me straight, Dr. Jewish.
"
,,
6,12,"Is he gonna live?
"
,,
6,12,"Mr. Griffin, I'm afraid your parrot is dead.
"
,,
6,12,"Noooooooooo!
"
,,
6,12,"Did he at least die with dignity?
"
,,
6,12,"Well, he convulsed a lot and
"
,,
6,12,"fell of the operating table.
"
,,
6,12,"Then he flopped around a little on the floor.
"
,,
6,12,"Then a passing nurse accidentally stepped on him
"
,,
6,12,"and kicked him into a puddle of urin,
"
,,
6,12,"which must have frightened him, because
"
,,
6,12,"his bowels released all over himself.
"
,,
6,12,"I tried to pick him up,
"
,,
6,12,"but then I got angry because
"
,,
6,12,"some of it got on my thump.
"
,,
6,12,"So I threw him against the
"
,,
6,12,"wall and that's where he died.
"
,,
6,12,"That's the way I want to go.
"
,,
6,12,"I'm really sorry about your dad's parrot.
"
,,
6,12,"Oh, that's okay.
"
,,
6,12,"He'll get over it pretty quickly and
"
,,
6,12,"then move on to another wacky thing.
"
,,
6,12,"Lois, whose pipe organ is this?
"
,,
6,12,"My name's Anna.
"
,,
6,12,"Um.. I'm Chris.
"
,,
6,12,"Sometimes I have to poop for a long time.
"
,,
6,12,"Now you say something.
"
,,
6,12,"You're funny.
"
,,
6,12,"But I bet a lot of girls tell you that, huh?
"
,,
6,12,"Well, the only girl I know is my sister
"
,,
6,12,"and she sucks!
"
,,
6,12,"Aha, sorry to hear that.
"
,,
6,12,"Wow, we're having a conversation.
"
,,
6,12,"Listen, I have to get back to work
"
,,
6,12,"but, um, would you maybe
"
,,
6,12,"wanna go out sometime?
"
,,
6,12,"Yeeesss!!!
"
,,
6,12,"Great, here's my number.
"
,,
6,12,"Awesome!
"
,,
6,12,"Oh no, I broke the pipe organ.
"
,,
6,12,"Hey, look, the deed to a cattle ranch.
"
,,
6,12,"So, um... how do you like working at the vet?
"
,,
6,12,"Oh, it is so rewarding.
"
,,
6,12,"Ever since I was a little girl,
"
,,
6,12,"I have loved working with animals.
"
,,
6,12,"Did you ever make it with one of the dogs?
"
,,
6,12,"What!?
"
,,
6,12,"I mean, I, I, did you enjoy your appetizer?
"
,,
6,12,"It hasn't come yet.
"
,,
6,12,"Oh, uhm, I mean, did you ever
"
,,
6,12,"make it with one of the dogs?
"
,,
6,12,"No! Stupid!
"
,,
6,12,"Chris, just relax.
"
,,
6,12,"Um, okay.
"
,,
6,12,"You know, Anna...
"
,,
6,12,"...when I first saw you, I thought you
"
,,
6,12,"were the most beautiful girl in the world.
"
,,
6,12,"And now all I wanna do is
"
,,
6,12,"show you my innermost self
"
,,
6,12,"but I'm afraid you'll reject me,
"
,,
6,12,"because you won't like what you see.
"
,,
6,12,"Or that you'll see my scrotum,
"
,,
6,12,"and see that it has a seam on it,
"
,,
6,12,"and then you'll think I'm made up of two
"
,,
6,12,"different guys that were sewn together,
"
,,
6,12,"'cause that's what I think happened, and...
"
,,
6,12,"Chris. I like you.
"
,,
6,12,"You don't have to try so hard.
"
,,
6,12,"I'm sorry.
"
,,
6,12,"When I'm around a pretty girl, I'll get all
"
,,
6,12,"worked up, like a kid watching a toy commercial.
"
,,
6,12,"Yeah!
"
,,
6,12,"Awesome!
"
,,
6,12,"Aww!
"
,,
6,12,"Whoa!
"
,,
6,12,"Kids?! Kids?!
"
,,
6,12,"It's so awesome!
"
,,
6,12,"I want it!
"
,,
6,12,"Hey fellas, uhm, I have a question.
"
,,
6,12,"I went on a date with this girl, that I really like,
"
,,
6,12,"and, if you don't mind, I was hoping
"
,,
6,12,"I could ask you a few questions,
"
,,
6,12,"about the birds and the bees?
"
,,
6,12,"Aha, my boy wants to know about sex.
"
,,
6,12,"Came to the right place.
"
,,
6,12,"Chris, would you always wanna remeber,
"
,,
6,12,"is that sex is perfectly natural.
"
,,
6,12,"Whoa, uh, uh,sorry, Mr. Swanson.
"
,,
6,12,"Um, I wasn't really talking to you.
"
,,
6,12,"Chris, I know a lot about sex.
"
,,
6,12,"Yeah, and I'm sure you have fond memories,
"
,,
6,12,"but I was kind of hoping to get some advice
"
,,
6,12,"from someone who isn't broken from the waist down.
"
,,
6,12,"I'm a father!
"
,,
6,12,"You're two wheeled Monster!
"
,,
6,12,"That's going to be my ring tone.
"
,,
6,12,"Quagmire, call me.
"
,,
6,12,"Well, I have to get to work, Chris.
"
,,
6,12,"I have tons and tons of dogs to incinerate,
"
,,
6,12,"but I can't wait to see you tomorrow night.
"
,,
6,12,"Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
"
,,
6,12,"I'll clean that up.
"
,,
6,12,"Oh, uh, that's okay, I'll
"
,,
6,12,"get it, have fun at work.
"
,,
6,12,"K, bye Chris.
"
,,
6,12,"What do you think you are doing?
"
,,
6,12,"What!?
"
,,
6,12,"You, a man, are cleaning up a mess made by Anna,
"
,,
6,12,"a woman, that she, also a
"
,,
6,12,"woman, spilled on you, a man.
"
,,
6,12,"So..!?
"
,,
6,12,"You treating here like a human beeing.
"
,,
6,12,"If you want to get anywhere with a
"
,,
6,12,"chick, you can't treat 'em too nice-like.
"
,,
6,12,"Really!?
"
,,
6,12,"Trust me, Chris.
"
,,
6,12,"The next time you see this
"
,,
6,12,"girl, treat her like crap.
"
,,
6,12,"And you'll be cooler than a mid
"
,,
6,12,"'80s novelty answering machine message.
"
,,
6,12,"It's me again.
"
,,
6,12,"I just had to hear it one more time.
"
,,
6,12,"Chris, is everything okay?
"
,,
6,12,"You seem a little, I don't know, quite tonight.
"
,,
6,12,"Yeah, everything's fine.
"
,,
6,12,"Ah yes, can I have two tickets,
"
,,
6,12,"one man and one bitch that needs to do what I say.
"
,,
6,12,"What!?
"
,,
6,12,"That's not funny, Chris.
"
,,
6,12,"Here is your ticket.
"
,,
6,12,"Pick that up!
"
,,
6,12,"Chris, why are you acting like this?
"
,,
6,12,"Pick that up and cook it into something delicious
"
,,
6,12,"or knit it into something that's useful to me!
"
,,
6,12,"Uhm. Are you ready to make out now?
"
,,
6,12,"Why in the world I wanan do
"
,,
6,12,"that after what you just said?
"
,,
6,12,"You obviously not the person I thought you were.
"
,,
6,12,"I never wanna see you again!
"
,,
6,12,"I can't believe I thought you were special
"
,,
6,12,"Anna, wait!
"
,,
6,12,"Oh no, what did I do!?
"
,,
6,12,"Hey Chris, guess what we just did?
"
,,
6,12,"Bonny, tell him.
"
,,
6,12," We had sex.
"
,,
6,12," We had sex!
"
,,
6,12,"We had what Joe calls sex.
"
,,
6,12,"Chris, honey, what's wrong?
"
,,
6,12,"Anna took a dump on me.
"
,,
6,12,"What!?
"
,,
6,12,"Yeah. She broke up with me.
"
,,
6,12,"Oh-ho, she dumped you, that's what you meant to say.
"
,,
6,12,"What's the difference?
"
,,
6,12,"What you said first was, what...
"
,,
6,12,"well, I mean, what when two
"
,,
6,12,"grown-ups love each other very much.
"
,,
6,12,"Sometimes they show it by, uhah, never mind.
"
,,
6,12,"So, so what happened?
"
,,
6,12,"I don't know.
"
,,
6,12,"I did everything Dad said.
"
,,
6,12,"Uch, I should've known that Peter
"
,,
6,12,"had something to do with this.
"
,,
6,12,"You're not the first person whose life he screwed up.
"
,,
6,12,"Knock, knock.
"
,,
6,12,"Nicole, Ronald, who's ready for Boggle?
"
,,
6,12,"Oh my god! No! Why!? Why!?
"
,,
6,12,"My beautiful Nicole.
"
,,
6,12,"My man Ranold, who did this!?
"
,,
6,12,"Oh man, there were so good together.
"
,,
6,12,"We were just establishing our friendship.
"
,,
6,12,"THey were about to get engaged.
"
,,
6,12,"Oh, he was going to ask me to be un usher.
"
,,
6,12,"I mean, he already had enough
"
,,
6,12,"grooms man, so he made me an usher.
"
,,
6,12,"But just to think I could be
"
,,
6,12,"involved in the ceremony in any way!
"
,,
6,12,"You told Chris to act like a jerk to this girl?!
"
,,
6,12,"Well... define Chris.
"
,,
6,12,"Peter, he's really upset right now.
"
,,
6,12,"I mean, he cared about this girl a lot.
"
,,
6,12,"Can't you see what you've done?
"
,,
6,12,"I don't know, I mean, I-I thought I was helping.
"
,,
6,12,"But you may be right,
"
,,
6,12,"'cause now Chris is all sad and
"
,,
6,12,"crying and fat and bad at sports.
"
,,
6,12,"Well, you created this mess
"
,,
6,12,"and you have to help him fix it.
"
,,
6,12,"Man, parenting is more complicated
"
,,
6,12,"then making a 1940s phone call.
"
,,
6,12,"Hello, operator?
"
,,
6,12,"Crestview 4162, please.
"
,,
6,12," Hello?
"
,,
6,12," Hello!
"
,,
6,12,"Well, what dou you know about that!?
"
,,
6,12,"Hey Chris, it's me.
"
,,
6,12,"I got something for you here.
"
,,
6,12,"What is it?
"
,,
6,12,"I caught you a bullfrog outside.
"
,,
6,12,"Poked some holes in its bag so it can breathe.
"
,,
6,12,"See, look at this-
"
,,
6,12,"Oh, boy.
"
,,
6,12,"All right, hang on, hang on.
"
,,
6,12,"I'm never gonna be happy again.
"
,,
6,12,"I know how you feel, son
"
,,
6,12,"but u can't give up now.
"
,,
6,12,"Now let's get out there and meet some ladies, eh?
"
,,
6,12,"But I don't want to date anyone else.
"
,,
6,12,"I want Anna.
"
,,
6,12,"Chris, you don't want to miss out
"
,,
6,12,"on experiencing your teenage years.
"
,,
6,12,"If you do, you'll feel as bad
"
,,
6,12,"as I do when I miss the toilet.
"
,,
6,12,"All right Chris, have a seat here.
"
,,
6,12,"Your date'll be here any minute.
"
,,
6,12,"I fact, I think she'll be
"
,,
6,12,"coming through that door.
"
,,
6,12,"Uh... Thanks.
"
,,
6,12,"So where are you from?
"
,,
6,12,"so you know I'm a good egg.</i>
"
,,
6,12," What!?</i>
"
,,
6,12,"what you might be getting him?</i>
"
,,
6,12,"How do you know when my dad's birthday is?
"
,,
6,12,"I dont' know - a tie.
"
,,
6,12," I think he might...
"
,,
6,12," Chris, I don't want a tie pick something else.
"
,,
6,12,"Chris, this is Barbara, the girl from
"
,,
6,12,"your class you used to have a crush on.
"
,,
6,12,"Now, you kids enjoy yourselves
"
,,
6,12,"and I'll create some atmosphere.
"
,,
6,12,"This is a favourite by ""Men At Work"".
"
,,
6,12,"Look at me with a brand-new Hyundai.
"
,,
6,12,"I dont' understand Chris, your Blind Date
"
,,
6,12,"should be here by now, she answered the ad.
"
,,
6,12,"Wohow...
"
,,
6,12,"So, still no luck on the girl front, huh?
"
,,
6,12,"I know Dad's been trying to help
"
,,
6,12,"and I'm trying to listen to him
"
,,
6,12,"but nothing seems to be working.
"
,,
6,12,"Well, I know, I asked him to help but it occurs
"
,,
6,12,"to me that you've been taking advice from everyone
"
,,
6,12,"except the one person who matters.
"
,,
6,12,"What are you want, Chris?
"
,,
6,12,"All I want is to go out with Anna again.
"
,,
6,12,"Then you just need to go talk to her
"
,,
6,12,"and tell her exactly how you feel.
"
,,
6,12,"But she's sad, she never wants to see me again.
"
,,
6,12,"Well, I'm sure you can come up with
"
,,
6,12,"some excuse to see her at the vet.
"
,,
6,12,"Is there anymore coffee?
"
,,
6,12,"Anna, I'm here with my dog.
"
,,
6,12,"He's not feeling well.
"
,,
6,12,"f*c* you!
"
,,
6,12,"Don't you think you rather go to another vet?
"
,,
6,12,"Anna, to be honest.
"
,,
6,12,"I came here 'cause I wanted to
"
,,
6,12,"apologize for acting like such a jerk.
"
,,
6,12,"That's not who I am.
"
,,
6,12,"Oh yeah, no, no, no yet, no,
"
,,
6,12,"you're, you're, you're a cool guy.
"
,,
6,12,"Brian, shut up!
"
,,
6,12,"Look, look, I was just really nervous
"
,,
6,12,"'cause I've never had a girlfriend before and
"
,,
6,12,"I wanted to make sure I didn't do anything wrong.
"
,,
6,12,"You know, you really hurt me, Chris.
"
,,
6,12,"I know, I was wrong.
"
,,
6,12,"I don't want to hurt anybody, Anna.
"
,,
6,12,"Please, just give me another chance.

7,1,"Well I guess it's not true what they say,
"
,,
7,1,"You can punch snoopy in the stomach as hard as you can and he
"
,,
7,1,"won't feel it.
"
,,
7,1," That's Houdini.

,,
7,1," No, Brian.

7,1,"Oh cool you're dressed like Napolean Dynamite.
"
,,
7,1,"Hey do you say anything funny?
"
,,
7,1,"No, i just do quirky things for the sake of being quirky.
"
,,
7,1,"You strike me as someone i wouldn't enjoy but others might.
"
,,
7,1," Who are you dressed as, Peter?
"
,,
7,1," I'm Laura Bush.
"
,,
7,1,"And I'm the guy she killed.
"
,,
7,1,"That's right, I forgot, Laura Bush killed a guy.

7,1,"Laura Bush killed a guy.
"
,,
7,1,"Laura Bush killed a guy.
"
,,
7,1,"Well, come on in.
"
,,
7,1,"Oh, you know this is why you, Brian, remember?
"
,,
7,1,"the last couple of weeks i kept saying:
"
,,
7,1,"Can I have a couple minutes of your time to talk to you about something?
"
,,
7,1,"This is what it was about.
"
,,
7,1,"This evening is ruined.
"
,,
7,1,"Look I... well what?
"
,,
7,1,"This evening is ruined. My all evening is ruined.
"
,,
7,1," Why you saying it like that?
"
,,
7,1," Saying what?
"
,,
7,1,"I'm just pointing out the party is ru-ined.
"
,,
7,1,"You know, I'm not gonna get sucked into this.
"
,,
7,1,"Okay, just so I'm sure, really?
"
,,
7,1,"Are-are you just trying to piss me off, or is that really how you say that?
"
,,
7,1,"What are you talking about? I'm talking about this ru-ined evening.
"
,,
7,1,"That's not how you say ruined.
"
,,
7,1,"What, ru-ined?
"
,,
7,1,"What do you call the remains of ancient greek structures.
"
,,
7,1," Ruins?
"
,,
7,1," And how would you describe this evening?
"
,,
7,1,"Oh, ru-ined, of course. This evening is ru-ined.
"
,,
7,1," Say ruined.
"
,,
7,1," Ru-ined.
"
,,
7,1," Ruined.
"
,,
7,1," Ru-ined.
"
,,
7,1," Ruined.
"
,,
7,1," Ru-ined.
"
,,
7,1," Dumbass.
"
,,
7,1," Oh Brian, don't be cru-el.
"
,,
7,1,"That's a great costume Joe.
"
,,
7,1," Are you FDR?
"
,,
7,1," No, I'm olympic swimmer Mark Spitz.
"
,,
7,1," Oh, you mean like if he dove into the shallow end?
"
,,
7,1," No, regular Mark Spitz.
"
,,
7,1,"Wait, are you Stephen Hawking at the beach?
"
,,
7,1,"No, I'm Mark Spitz!
"
,,
7,1,"He won seven gold medals!
"
,,
7,1,"Oh, I get it, you're crippled Magnum PI.
"
,,
7,1,"I'm... Fine, I'm crippled Magnum PI.
"
,,
7,1,"Brian, there's that girl from our yoga class I wanted you to meet.
"
,,
7,1,"Now, look Lois, I appreciate it, but I..I'm not into fix-ups.
"
,,
7,1,"Oh come on, you gotta get yourself back out there.
"
,,
7,1,"Jane, this is Brian.
"
,,
7,1,"Oh Brian, Lois has told me so much about you.
"
,,
7,1,"Wow, you're even more handsome than she said.
"
,,
7,1,"Hey, thanks. So uh... that's a great costume.
"
,,
7,1," What are you, one of Freddy Krueger's victims?
"
,,
7,1," I'm a victim of the liberal agenda.
"
,,
7,1,"I'm a murdered fetus.
"
,,
7,1,"Did you know that Democrats murder thousands of babies every year?
"
,,
7,1,"And sometimes babies are put back into the womb just so that they can be aborted again?
"
,,
7,1," Have you ever had any sex that was voluntary?
"
,,
7,1," No, I have not.
"
,,
7,1,"Yeah, have a good evening. Come on, buddy, lets go.
"
,,
7,1,"Yep, with a capital C.
"
,,
7,1,"Oh, stop looking so depressed, Brian.
"
,,
7,1,"I'm sure one day you'll meet a girl who loves abortion as much as you do.
"
,,
7,1,"That's not the point, Stewie. I'm just...
"
,,
7,1,"tired of every girl I meet beeing crazy.
"
,,
7,1,"Ah, things'll work out for you.
"
,,
7,1,"Now, come on, let's forget our problems and get lost in the world of books.
"
,,
7,1,"Ooh! ""Horton Hears Domestic Violence in the Next Apartment and Doesn't Call 911""
"
,,
7,1," No.
"
,,
7,1," You think I like it?!</i>
"
,,
7,1," I don't wanna hurt you! You make me hurt you!</i>
"
,,
7,1,"I'm sure there's two sides to this.
"
,,
7,1," Oops.
"
,,
7,1," I'm sorry.
"
,,
7,1," I-I don't think you want this book, It's all about atheism.
"
,,
7,1," Oh, I know.
"
,,
7,1," I'm an atheist.
"
,,
7,1," Really?
"
,,
7,1," So am I.
"
,,
7,1," It's all yours.
"
,,
7,1,"I feel bad, taking the last copy.
"
,,
7,1,"Well, there's..one way to settle this.
"
,,
7,1,"If there is a God, send another copy.
"
,,
7,1,"Oh, I guess that's our answer.
"
,,
7,1,"Tell you what, how about I take it and then send it after i read it.
"
,,
7,1,"Swear to god?
"
,,
7,1,"Stop it!
"
,,
7,1,"'Cause... missing will... Hey, listen... here's-here's my address.
"
,,
7,1,"Thanks. See you later.
"
,,
7,1,"God, still no mail for me, huh?
"
,,
7,1,"Geez, Brian, you've been going to the mail every day for a week, what are you looking for?
"
,,
7,1,"I'm expecting a very important package.
"
,,
7,1,"Another one?
"
,,
7,1,"You haven't even open the one that came for you a week ago.
"
,,
7,1,"You idiot! What didn't you tell me this was here?
"
,,
7,1,"Because, i have been using it as a hat-weight.
"
,,
7,1," A what?
"
,,
7,1," A hat-weight Brian.
"
,,
7,1,"My hat kept blowing away so i put the package on it so i wouldn't loose it.
"
,,
7,1,"That's the dumbest think I've ever heard, you don't wear a hat and there's no wind in here.
"
,,
7,1,"You, Sir, owe me one new hat.
"
,,
7,1,"You know huh... I was really glad you sent me the book.
"
,,
7,1,"I won't lie to you, I came this close to praying that I'd see you again.
"
,,
7,1,"Good thing you didn't, because...
"
,,
7,1,"Who would hear it, right?
"
,,
7,1,"Can I interest you folks in some of our heavenly cheesecake?
"
,,
7,1,"No, but I'll have some of your ""There is no after-life Souffl"".
"
,,
7,1,"Now we got the waiter involved.
"
,,
7,1,"I love being a part of things. I'll bring your dessert now.
"
,,
7,1,"You know Carolyn, I rarely find myself
"
,,
7,1,"connected with another person like I have with you. I'm really enjoying your compagny.
"
,,
7,1,"Me too, Brian.
"
,,
7,1,"I had a really great time tonight, Brian.
"
,,
7,1,"Well, is there... any reason it has to end?
"
,,
7,1,"Don't do it Brian.
"
,,
7,1,"What the hell? Ex-excuse me for a second.
"
,,
7,1,"Stewie, have you been hiding in the back all evening?
"
,,
7,1,"Yes, I'm saving you from yourself Brian.
"
,,
7,1,"You almost went in there and tried to have sex with that girl.
"
,,
7,1," So, what's wrong with that?
"
,,
7,1," That's why you can't maintain a relationship.
"
,,
7,1,"You always try too soon and end up blowing it.
"
,,
7,1,"Think about it.
"
,,
7,1,"God, you know maybe you're right.
"
,,
7,1,"I-I do, I-I always try and jump into the sex right away.
"
,,
7,1,"Maybe that's what screws things up.
"
,,
7,1,"You know... I'm gonna take it slow this time.
"
,,
7,1," Listen, huh... I-I gotta go.
"
,,
7,1," Really?
"
,,
7,1,"Don't worry, you'll see me again.
"
,,
7,1,"Good job Brian, don't worry I'll help you through this.
"
,,
7,1,"So, you want to get something to eat?
"
,,
7,1,"Can we go some place where the menus have pictures of the food?
"
,,
7,1,"OH LET'S GO SOME PLACE WHERE THE MENUS HAVE PICTURES OF FOOD!
"
,,
7,1,"Gosh... I really enjoyed the movie tonight.
"
,,
7,1,"Yeah... You knew it was gonna be a touching comedy
"
,,
7,1,"because Robin Williams had a beard.
"
,,
7,1,"My back is so stiff from sitting in that theater chair.
"
,,
7,1,"I could probably use a backrub.
"
,,
7,1," Do you mind?
"
,,
7,1," Nope, not at all.
"
,,
7,1,"You know I huh... took a Tha massage class at the Learning Annex.
"
,,
7,1,"Boy, that's an awfully loud owl.
"
,,
7,1,"Don't do it Brian!
"
,,
7,1,"Take it slow.
"
,,
7,1,"'Course I'll tell you what would really set you right is uh...
"
,,
7,1,"couple of Aleves and a good night's sleep.
"
,,
7,1," Alright, if you say so.
"
,,
7,1," Well, I... guess I should say good night.
"
,,
7,1,"Good job Brian!
"
,,
7,1," Hi there.
"
,,
7,1," Not interested.
"
,,
7,1," Ok.
"
,,
7,1,"Ooh, tandem bike.
"
,,
7,1,"You gonna take a ride out in the country and let the AIDS blow through your hair?
"
,,
7,1,"Get lost Stewie, I am getting laid tonight.
"
,,
7,1,"  What happened to ""taking it slow""?
"
,,
7,1," I have been taking it slow.
"
,,
7,1,"We've been going out for three weeks and I haven't tried anything.
"
,,
7,1,"Even though she's been giving me some pretty strong signals.
"
,,
7,1,"So, do you have any thoughts on what you might wanna do tonight?
"
,,
7,1,"I don't know...
"
,,
7,1,"I don't know Brian, you don't want to mess things up.
"
,,
7,1,"Well, we'll find out tonight, won't we?
"
,,
7,1,"Alright, but just one last piece of advice: Remember,
"
,,
7,1,"listen to her body, and respond the way you'd want her to respond to you.
"
,,
7,1,"Okay, thanks. That's very helpful.
"
,,
7,1,"You'll be a wonderful lover, Brian.
"
,,
7,1," What are you doing?
"
,,
7,1," Oh, sorry, you just had a little... something.
"
,,
7,1,"Oh my God! Carolyn?! Cleveland?!
"
,,
7,1,"Oh hey Brian, close that window you're letting all the stink out.
"
,,
7,1,"I don't believe this. Cleveland you're sleeping with my girlfriend.
"
,,
7,1,"Nobody told me Carolyn was your girlfriend.
"
,,
7,1," I'm not his girlfriend.
"
,,
7,1," Carolyn what are you talking about? We've been dating for three weeks.
"
,,
7,1,"Well, you never made a move on me so I thought you just wanted to be friends.
"
,,
7,1,"And I met Cleveland, and, things just kinda took off.
"
,,
7,1,"But...H-how did you even meet each other?
"
,,
7,1,"We met at the Starbucks.
"
,,
7,1,"She started going on about her new brazilian wax
"
,,
7,1,"and not wearing any underpants and whatnot.
"
,,
7,1,"I'd have to be a homosexual to ignore a signal like that.
"
,,
7,1,"But, Carolyn, you completely misunderstood me... I wanted you like crazy, but...
"
,,
7,1," I just figured if I showed a little restraint you'd respect me.
"
,,
7,1," I do.
"
,,
7,1,"As do I.
"
,,
7,1,"Now why don't you go hop on that gay bike of yours
"
,,
7,1,"and go get yourself a lollipop or a cupcake or something.
"
,,
7,1,"We're good, Brian, we're good.
"
,,
7,1,"So, Carolyn...
"
,,
7,1," Guess she should have hit that when you had the chance Brian.
"
,,
7,1," What? you are the one who told me to wait !
"
,,
7,1,"Oh, you're crazy bitch, I didn't say that, bitch.
"
,,
7,1," Yeah, well thanks to you, I lost her to Cleveland.
"
,,
7,1," You know what you need?
"
,,
7,1,"You need to stop pointing fingers, and get out of the house, have some fun!
"
,,
7,1,"Real fun, not like thirty-seven year-old woman on a Blind Date fun.
"
,,
7,1,"This is fun, right. We're having fun.
"
,,
7,1,"I mean, so what if you forgot your wallet, I'll pay. I'm gonna pay for us.
"
,,
7,1,"You'll get it next time, yeah. So you're impressive right? killed a man.
"
,,
7,1," I'm sure it was on self-defence.
"
,,
7,1," No. I just felt like killing.
"
,,
7,1,"You tell the best stories. Me and my three eggs are having the best time.
"
,,
7,1,"We're gonna get you back on your feet Brian.
"
,,
7,1,"I know what always make me feel better. Delicious sweets.
"
,,
7,1,"Halloo! Welcome to Fjurg's Backery.
"
,,
7,1,"Would you like a hot piss of pee?
"
,,
7,1," It's on the hoose!
"
,,
7,1," What?
"
,,
7,1,"Oh noo! You're covered in my hot pee!
"
,,
7,1,"You can wash yourself off in the WC.
"
,,
7,1," Oh, you know, I can just wash if off when I get home.
"
,,
7,1," Why, what's in here?
"
,,
7,1,"Wait... wait... wait...
"
,,
7,1,"Oooh, and boom goes the dynamite.
"
,,
7,1,"Ok look, next time we'll go to another store, how about that?
"
,,
7,1,"Just... forget her alright? I just want to sit here
"
,,
7,1,"watch the ball game and have a few beers.
"
,,
7,1," I'll tell you what this would be painful</i>
"
,,
7,1,"Boy what are the odds of running into Cleveland and Carolyn everywhere we went, huh?
"
,,
7,1,"Well, as long as we just stay here in the house we're safe, right?
"
,,
7,1," Oh that was a great game.
"
,,
7,1," Carolyn it's been so nice getting to know you.
"
,,
7,1,"Yeah Cleveland, she's way more fun than that wife you used to have.
"
,,
7,1,"Wha-what was her name? Lizzy or Florida or something.
"
,,
7,1," Jennifer Hudson.
"
,,
7,1," Loretta.
"
,,
7,1,"You know it's amazing Cleveland, you went from a black
"
,,
7,1,"woman to a white woman without having to take a hispanic woman step in between.
"
,,
7,1," Loretta! That's our answer.
"
,,
7,1," What do you mean?
"
,,
7,1,"We've just got to go talk to Loretta.
"
,,
7,1,"If we can get her back with Cleveland, Carolyn's all yours.
"
,,
7,1,"That's a long shot. But so was the shouting Arab Gram business.
"
,,
7,1,"From John and Keith.
"
,,
7,1,"You know what, this is never gonna work, Stewie. Loretta cheated on
"
,,
7,1,"Cleveland. She's not gonna want to go back to him.
"
,,
7,1,"Oh, she can be convinced, Brian. Just let me do the talking.
"
,,
7,1,"No, I think I can communicate with her better.
"
,,
7,1,"She's only gonna get the gist of what you're saying.
"
,,
7,1,"Really? Isn't she one of those people outside the family who can understand me?
"
,,
7,1,"No, I think because of Cleveland, she's close enough to the main cast
"
,,
7,1," that it might be a little weird.
"
,,
7,1," Really?
"
,,
7,1," We're filming.
"
,,
7,1," Ok, ok, alright, sorry, sorry. Ring the doorbell.
"
,,
7,1," Hi Loretta.
"
,,
7,1," Brian, Stewie.
"
,,
7,1," What are you doing here?
"
,,
7,1," Huh... well, to be honest Loretta...
"
,,
7,1," Cleveland sent us, he... really want you back.
"
,,
7,1," What?
"
,,
7,1,"Yes, he says he misses that
"
,,
7,1,"perfect figure.
"
,,
7,1,"Well, I get the gist of what you're saying, Stewie.
"
,,
7,1,"But I can never go back to Cleveland. Not after all the pain I cause him.
"
,,
7,1,"I'm sorry.
"
,,
7,1," Hey Brian, d'you see that treadmill in the living room?
"
,,
7,1," Yeah.
"
,,
7,1," Brian, may I speak with you?
"
,,
7,1," Oh, Cleveland.
"
,,
7,1,"I didn't reconize you without my
"
,,
7,1,"girlfriend wrapped around your waist.
"
,,
7,1,"She and I are both to a point of great soreness.
"
,,
7,1,"So we took a break.
"
,,
7,1,"Listen, I just wanna clear any bad feelings
"
,,
7,1,"you may have about me and Carolyn.
"
,,
7,1,"I guess it's okay. These are
"
,,
7,1,"passing flings, nothing to get upset about.
"
,,
7,1,"Good.
"
,,
7,1,"Because we're gonna elope in Hawaii tomorrow night!
"
,,
7,1," What?
"
,,
7,1," You got a problem with that, you can go fuck yourself.
"
,,
7,1," Loretta.
"
,,
7,1," Hello, Cleveland.
"
,,
7,1,"What are you doing here?
"
,,
7,1,"Cleveland, I've been doing some thinking lately about how much I miss you.
"
,,
7,1,"I'm sorry if I hurted you.
"
,,
7,1,"I want us to be together again as a family, and
"
,,
7,1,"I promess I'll never betray you again.
"
,,
7,1,"I love you Cleveland.
"
,,
7,1,"I'm no meteorologist, but I'm pretty sure it's rainin' bitches.
"
,,
7,1,"I-I don't know what to do. Carolyn and I are supposed to elope tomorrow.
"
,,
7,1,"But here comes Loretta all apologetic
"
,,
7,1,"and wanting to get our family back together and whatnot.
"
,,
7,1,"I wouldn't forgive her so fast Cleveland. Remember she slept with Quagmire.
"
,,
7,1,"Yeah, she really acted crazy.
"
,,
7,1,"Well, just-just wait a minute you guys, let's not be
"
,,
7,1,"so quick to demonize Loretta, I mean...
"
,,
7,1,"Whatever happened to ""Forgive and Forget""?
"
,,
7,1,"Oh, you just want Cleveland out of the picture,
"
,,
7,1,"so you can get back with Carolyn.
"
,,
7,1,"You know Brian...
"
,,
7,1,"Sometimes...
"
,,
7,1,"I don't believe I know you.
"
,,
7,1,"That-that's not it at all. I-I happen to think Loretta is very beautiful
"
,,
7,1,"with her sassy wisdom and
"
,,
7,1,"speedbag arm fat.
"
,,
7,1,"I guess at the very least i could go talk to her tomorrow and see how I feel.
"
,,
7,1,"Thanks for your help, Griffins.
"
,,
7,1,"Brian, do you really think Loretta is beautiful?
"
,,
7,1,"Absolutely, that's really how I feel.
"
,,
7,1,"Now it is true her personality is abrasive.
"
,,
7,1,"Slightly abrasive.
"
,,
7,1,"But overall, Loretta is a delightful person,
"
,,
7,1,"very pleasant to be around, and free to
"
,,
7,1,"pursue a life of religious fulfillment
"
,,
7,1,"I'm really concerned about Cleveland.
"
,,
7,1,"What Loretta did was inforgivable.
"
,,
7,1," I hope he doesn't go back to her.
"
,,
7,1," I hear you Lois.
"
,,
7,1,"You know there might be a way to
"
,,
7,1,"drive the point home that she hasn't changed.
"
,,
7,1," How would you do that?
"
,,
7,1," Hang on.
"
,,
7,1,"Hey, Quagmire!
"
,,
7,1," What?</i>
"
,,
7,1," No, I've got a hand free, what's up?</i>
"
,,
7,1,"Would you mind getting Loretta to sleep with you again?
"
,,
7,1,"Well we're trying to make Cleveland see that she's no good
"
,,
7,1,"and that he can't trust her and if he catches you guys in the act
"
,,
7,1,"Terrific. Thank you.
"
,,
7,1,"This is perfect Lois. We'll expose Loretta for who she is.
"
,,
7,1,"Just like Cyrano was exposed for being an antisemitic.
"
,,
7,1,"I love you for all that you are.
"
,,
7,1,"In spite of the fact that your people control
"
,,
7,1,"a disproportion in amount of the world's wealth.

7,1,"I came over here wanting to believe that there was still a chance for us.
"
,,
7,1,"But, on the way, i passed a lake, skipped a few rocks
"
,,
7,1,"and had some black-guy thinking time.
"
,,
7,1,"Loretta, we lived certain parts of our lives in the past for a reason.
"
,,
7,1,"What you and I, you can go ahead and put you clothes back on.

7,1," Isn't there anything I can do to make you happy.
"
,,
7,1," Yes, there is.
"
,,
7,1,"You can live your life, Loretta.
"

"
,,
7,1," Well, we both got screwed by the same girl.
"
,,
7,1," Yep.
"
,,
7,1,"I guess it's alright though.
"
,,
7,1," You and I will found true love someday.
"
,,
7,1," Yeah, I suppose.
"
,,
7,1," So, how was it having sex with Carolyn?
"
,,
7,1," I think I'm gonna remember it forever.
"
,,
7,1," Oh yeah, how so ?
"
,,
7,1," Brian, do you think you could identify a genital wart?
"
,,
7,1,"I... I-I-I... I-I would think that would be something you'd check with your doctor about.
"
,,
7,1," Okay.
"
,,
7,1," Okay?
"
,,
7,1," Yeah.
"
,,
7,1," Alright, 'cause I'm, I'm-I'm not a doctor, I can't...

"
,,
7,2,"Boy, Am I gonna enjoy this meal.
"
,,
7,2,"Not like last night when I didn't have time to poop before the guests arrived.
"

7,2,"Do I have time? You know what, I'm gonna go for it.
"

7,2,"Son of a bitch! Looks like I'm gonna have to pile all dinner on top of... He guys how are you!

7,2,"Look at  this place. They don't serve any of this 1950's food anymore.
"

7,2,"Hamburgers, french fries, cokes. He-he, you kids don't know what I'm talking about.
"

7,2,"Hey! What are you, a robot?
"
,,
7,2,"No son. It's the 1950's and I have polio.
"
,,
7,2,"Wow, I've never heard of that before.
"
,,
7,2,"Oh yeah Chris. Polio back then was like AIDS today. Except people who have polio get in to heaven.
"
,,
7,2,"Oh my God! This is Surfin' Bird by The Thrashmen. This is my favorite song of all time.
"
,,
7,2,"Chris don't you know about the bird?
"
,,
7,2,"Meg, everybody knows that the bird is the word!
"
,,
7,2,"Hey, guy behind the counter, the bird is the word!
"
,,
7,2,"Hey, frightened little child, the bird is the word.
"

7,2,"Lady on the toilet, the bird is the word.
"
,,
7,2,"Hey, don't you know about the bird?
"
,,
7,2,"Sure, everybody knows that the bird is the word.
"
,,
7,2,"Again, Again, I love repetition.
"
,,
7,2,"Hey what's the big idea?
"
,,
7,2,"This song from the 1960's, it shouldn't be in this jukebox.
"
,,
7,2,"Wait wait! Can I have that record? I love that song.
"
,,
7,2,"I'll let you have sex with my daughter.
"
,,
7,2,"I don't know, let's see what you daughter looks like.
"
,,
7,2,"She's... er... right there.
"
,,
7,2,"Okay. I'll do her. But can you tell her to cry and beg me to stop?
"
,,
7,2,"I think that can be arranged.
"
,,
7,2,"Peter will you give this song a rest? You've been playing it ever since we've got home.
"
,,
7,2,"No way Lois, it's my new favorite thing in the world.
"
,,
7,2,"Argh...
"
,,
7,2,"Lois... I'm gonna ask you this only once
"
,,
7,2,"Do you or do you not know about the bird?
"
,,
7,2,"Oh God!
"
,,
7,2,"'Cause everybody's heard that the bird is the word...
"
,,
7,2,"Aw...
"
,,
7,2,"Oh God! Sorry, sorry, sorry.
"
,,
7,2,"Look, just go to sleep all right?
"
,,
7,2,"Peter, I have a mammogram in the morning.
"
,,
7,2,"Brian, can I see that paper for a sec?
"
,,
7,2,"Huh... That's odd I thought that would be big news.
"
,,
7,2,"You thought what would be big news?
"
,,
7,2,"Well there seems to be an absence of a certain ornithological piece.
"
,,
7,2,"A headline regarding mass awareness of a certain avion variety
"
,,
7,2,"What are you talking about?
"
,,
7,2,"Oh, have you not heard?
"
,,
7,2,"It was my understanding that everyone had heard.
"
,,
7,2,"heard what?
"
,,
7,2,"Brian, don't!
"
,,
7,2,"Brian don't you know about the bird?
"
,,
7,2,"Well, Peter's gonna tell you about the bird.
"
,,
7,2,"Oh my God! Peter you all right?
"
,,
7,2,"Peter I was just at the bank and they told me you withdrew six thousand dollars cash from our savings.
"
,,
7,2,"That's almost everything we have! What the hell was it for?
"
,,
7,2,"I bought some local TV air time, Lois, and I did a public service announcement of vital importance.
"
,,
7,2,"Thank you.
"
,,
7,2,"Hi. I'm Peter Griffin.
"
,,
7,2,"You know there's an issue facing many americans today that I know concerns a great number of us.
"
,,
7,2,"According to Gallup polls one in twelve americans is unaware that the bird is the word.
"
,,
7,2,"I've for one dream of an America where everybody knows that the bird is the word.
"
,,
7,2,"My God! Is it possible.
"
,,
7,2,"Have the boys at the lab confirmed this?
"
,,
7,2,"Sir! Our math shows that the bird is equal to or greater than the word.
"
,,
7,2,"Check it again!
"
,,
7,2,"Brian?
"
,,
7,2,"Yeah.
"
,,
7,2,"I don't feel so good.
"
,,
7,2,"All right, that's it! We gotta do something about this.
"
,,
7,2,"We have got to get that record and destroy it.
"
,,
7,2,"Just like that fat person surgery destroyed Star Jones's arms.
"
,,
7,2,"I look so good. I lost all this weight.
"
,,
7,2,"TAXI!
"
,,
7,2,"Coming to show to people how I said how I look.
"
,,
7,2,"WHO!? GET IT!?
"
,,
7,2,"Who did what, pop?
"
,,
7,2,"Yes Peter, what has you upset?
"
,,
7,2,"Surfin' bird is gone!
"
,,
7,2,"I took it to bed, had sex with it. It fell asleep in my arms and this morning it's gone.
"
,,
7,2,"Well Peter, nobody here would steal from you.
"
,,
7,2,"Oh, no one had a motive Lois?
"
,,
7,2,"You all had a motive, every one here.
"
,,
7,2,"You knew that I changed my will and left everything to the record.
"
,,
7,2,"And that's why you wanted the record out of the way.
"
,,
7,2,"Meg wanted to get a passport for her twin sister to get her out of the country but the record wouldn't allow it.
"
,,
7,2,"But Meg didn't count on me discovering she has no twin sister.
"
,,
7,2,"And Meg itself was recently released from the sanitarium.
"
,,
7,2,"And that's where Chris came into the picture.
"
,,
7,2,"So you got it all figured out, do you?
"
,,
7,2,"You couldn't leave well enough alone.
"
,,
7,2,"You won't fire Chris, you don't got the stomach for it.
"
,,
7,2,"I'm sorry dad, I've no idea what  you're talking about.
"
,,
7,2,"Well, it sure is odd. A record doesn't just get up and walk away.
"
,,
7,2,"Except for my old Allen Sherman record.
"
,,
7,2,"If you ain't gonna play me, don't complain when I try to split.
"
,,
7,2,"There's a lot of jews out there still get a laugh of a ""hello mother, hello father"".
"
,,
7,2,"Whoo, such heat this morning I don't need this jacket.
"
,,
7,2,"Well, a hell with all of you. I'm going downtown and buy another copy of Surfin' Bird.
"
,,
7,2,"Peter that's not necessary. I'm sure it'll turn up somewhere.
"
,,
7,2,"I wouldn't count on it Lois.
"
,,
7,2,"Do you have Surfin' Bird by The Thrashmen?
"
,,
7,2,"No, I'm sorry. A dog and a baby came in and bought all 63 copies.
"
,,
7,2,"Damn it, this is third used record store with that same story.
"
,,
7,2,"You are... You look familiar. Do I, do I know you?
"
,,
7,2,"Did you go into North Providence high school?
"
,,
7,2,"No.
"
,,
7,2,"You friends with Gary who owns the drycleaners?
"
,,
7,2,"No.
"
,,
7,2,"Are you Jesus Christ?
"
,,
7,2,"No...
"
,,
7,2,"Oh my God! You are, you Jesus Christ!
"
,,
7,2,"No, I'm not. I'm just a guy working at a record store.
"
,,
7,2,"Huh! Well if you're not Jesus Christ, then you won't mind if I pee on this Amy Grant CD's.
"
,,
7,2,"Don't...
"
,,
7,2,"Aha, you are Jesus.
"
,,
7,2,"Yes. I am.
"
,,
7,2,"Oh my God! Jesus Christ, the Messiah, you've returned.
"
,,
7,2,"You've returned to bring us the good word!
"
,,
7,2,"What word?
"
,,
7,2,"Jesus Christ has returned to earth. I can't believe it.
"
,,
7,2,"The Second Coming.
"
,,
7,2,"Will you keep it down? It's not the second coming.
"
,,
7,2,"Okay, so what are you doing here?
"
,,
7,2,"Well, believe it or not, I pop in every hundred years or so.
"
,,
7,2,"Kinda incognito. Just to get away from the family.
"
,,
7,2,"Plus the timing seemed good, 'cause my dad just quit smoking and is a little on edge.
"
,,
7,2,"Who took my checkbook? Helen! Why is there a pen cap and no pen?
"
,,
7,2,"You're the first person to recognize me in two thousand years.
"
,,
7,2,"You seem like a nice guy. Hey won't you come over to my house for dinner tonight?
"
,,
7,2,"Okay. But I don't get off until 7.
"
,,
7,2,"Great! We'll have a blast. After we eat we can watch that youtube footage of xx xx calling moviephone.
"
,,
7,2,"Please say the name of the movie you'd like to see NOW.
"
,,
7,2,"xxxx.
"
,,
7,2,"I'm sorry I didn't catch that.
"
,,
7,2,"Please say the name of the movie you'd like to see NOW.
"
,,
7,2,"xxxxx.
"
,,
7,2,"You have selected ""300""
"
,,
7,2,"If this is the movie you'd like to see, say yes NOW.
"
,,
7,2,"NO!
"
,,
7,2,"You have confirmed ""300""
"
,,
7,2,"Wow! Jesus Christ at our dinner table. I still can't get over it.
"
,,
7,2,"I'm actually glad you're all here tonight.
"
,,
7,2,"I wanted tell you that one of you will betray me.
"
,,
7,2,"Just kidding.
"
,,
7,2,"He's doing that thing he did in this story book.
"
,,
7,2,"So Jesus finish that story you were telling us.
"
,,
7,2,"Oh, all right. So there I was. They just beaten me senseless. Stuck thorns in my head.
"
,,
7,2,"Nailed me to the piece of wood. Shoved the spunch full of vinegar in my mouth and killed me.
"
,,
7,2,"Then they put me into a hole with a rock in front of it for two whole days.
"
,,
7,2,"And come sunday BAM, I rise from the dead.
"
,,
7,2,"Okay, that sounds like a naughty weekend but I can top it.
"
,,
7,2,"So me and Cleveland and Joe are just wrecked on southern comfort right?
"
,,
7,2,"We know we gonna puke but Joe says
"
,,
7,2,"""Hey let's go see Chronicles of Riddick""
"
,,
7,2,"Sat through the whole thing without puking and then I get home wouldn't you know I lost my glasses.
"
,,
7,2,"Huh? Peter 1 - Jesus 0
"
,,
7,2,"Ah, you know Jesus if I go get myself on, would you mind talking to my friend Mariel Goldman?
"
,,
7,2,"I really just want to rub her jewish nose in this.
"
,,
7,2,"All right, I'll be the one to say it. How do we know you really Jesus?
"
,,
7,2,"Can you perform miracles?
"
,,
7,2,"Sure. How about this?
"
,,
7,2,"Oh boy! Sundays!
"
,,
7,2,"I love you Jesus.
"
,,
7,2,"I love you too fella.
"
,,
7,2,"Hey Jesus can you do something for me?
"
,,
7,2,"Sure Peter, what is it?
"
,,
7,2,"Say listen Jesus, I know you're trying to keep a low profile but
"
,,
7,2,"there's one person I really want you to meet.
"
,,
7,2,"Oh yeah, who's that?
"
,,
7,2,"The American people may have turned against the war but I answer to a higher power.
"
,,
7,2,"I answer to the power of Jesus Christ.
"
,,
7,2,"Oh, that's funny, because I happen to have Jesus Christ right here.
"
,,
7,2,"I've heard what you were saying. You know nothing of my work.
"
,,
7,2,"How you ever got to be president of anything is totally amazing.
"
,,
7,2,"Wouldn't it be great if life were like this?
"
,,
7,2,"Hey listen Jesus, thanks for coming by tonight and hanging out with us.
"
,,
7,2,"You may look like a bum but you've got a lot of talent, young man.
"
,,
7,2,"Yeah, I've forgotten how great it is interacting with other people.
"
,,
7,2,"Well, I better get some sleep, I gotta open the store tomorrow.
"
,,
7,2,"Ah, you don't wanna get back to that record store. You gotta get back out there.
"
,,
7,2,"Coloring eggs and hiding them for kids.
"
,,
7,2,"What? You mean reveal myself?
"
,,
7,2,"Absolutely. This world needs you, Jesus. It needs you like the guy who can't get it up needs a distraction.
"
,,
7,2,"I'm so ready to have sex with you. Oh, hey is that my phone?
"
,,
7,2,"I don't hear anything.
"
,,
7,2,"Is that John Aston?
"
,,
7,2,"I don't see anyone out there.
"
,,
7,2,"Oh, well now, there's so much going on.
"
,,
7,2,"You know you're right, Peter. It may be time. But how do we do it?
"
,,
7,2,"Everyone, may I have your attention please. I would like to introduce you to the one, the only... Jesus Christ.

7,2,"Well, there's only one space left and I promised it to that cow.
"
,,
7,2,"This is gonna be so much fun. I'm gonna stick my head out the sunroof and wave my arms and go ""Whoo, I'm in Hollywood!""
"
,,
7,2,"Whoo, I'm in Hollywood! Gee, I've said I'll do it.
"
,,
7,2,"Peter, would you put that thing away, we're trying to eat dinner.
"
,,
7,2,"I can't believe Jesus hasn't called me back. I left him a message like 4 hours ago.
"
,,
7,2,"Well, maybe he doesn't have his phone with him.
"
,,
7,2,"No, no, I rang twice and then a voice mail picked up.
"
,,
7,2,"If it gone straight to voice mail that means the phone was off.
"
,,
7,2,"If I rang like 6 times that means he didn't hear it but I rang twice Lois.
"
,,
7,2,"That means a phone rang, he saw it was me and then he pressed a button and sent it straight to voice mail.
"
,,
7,2,"You know what, give me your phone, I bet he'll pick up.
"
,,
7,2,"Hehey Lois.
"
,,
7,2,"Hey you. It's Peter. What the hell we were supposed to do something today.
"
,,
7,2,"Ah... Forgot to tell you, I have a doctor's appointment today, I'm actually there now.
"
,,
7,2,"Hey look, Lindsay Lohan just took her top off.
"
,,
7,2,"Heeey, I just drink a beer, who wants to do me?
"
,,
7,2,"I do.
"
,,
7,2,"Me too.
"
,,
7,2,"I just did you, but I'll go again.
"
,,
7,2,"I gotta go.
"
,,
7,2,"Can you believe the way Jesus has treatened me?
"
,,
7,2,"I thought he was my friend.
"
,,
7,2,"Fame and success do crazy things to people Peter.
"
,,
7,2,"I'm sure deep down he's still that same old Jesus.
"
,,
7,2,"He may just need to figure that out in his own way.
"
,,
7,2,"Maybe. But one thing's for sure Lois.
"
,,
7,2,"None of this would've happen if somebody haven't stolen my fucking Surfin' Bird record!!!
"
,,
7,2,"Tonights top story: Local record shop employee Jesus Christ was found
"
,,
7,2,"in Mary-Kate Olsons apartment this morning face down and unconscious.
"
,,
7,2,"Police revived and arrested the disoriented Jesus who was quoted to saying:
"
,,
7,2,"""Jews are responsible for all the world's wars""
"
,,
7,2,"Brian, you think that's our Jesus?
"
,,
7,2,"Griffin's residence, Peter speaking.
"
,,
7,2,"Oh yeah?.. Why should I?..
"
,,
7,2,"Yeah, well, get someone else to bail you out, 'cause it ain't gonna be me.
"
,,
7,2,"Yeah, well, what are you gonna do about it?
"
,,
7,2,"All right, I'm coming.
"
,,
7,2,"Jesus Christ look at you. You've had it all: money, fame, eternal life. And you blew it. You let it all go to your head.
"
,,
7,2,"I know Peter. I guess it turns out I'm just as human as anyone else.
"
,,
7,2,"Yeah, well, what are we doing now?
"
,,
7,2,"You want the truth? I think it's time for me to go.
"
,,
7,2,"This world's not ready for me yet and I'm not ready for it.
"
,,
7,2,"I don't know. Maybe I'll try coming back in another thousand years when I'm a little more mature.
"
,,
7,2,"Well, that's a very mature thing to say right there.
"
,,
7,2,"I think you're on your way.
"
,,
7,2,"Well, before I go Peter, there's something I wanna give you.
"
,,
7,2,"Hold out your hands.
"
,,
7,2,"Well, I guess that's it then. Jesus is gone.
"
,,
7,2,"I sure am gonna miss him.
"
,,
7,2,"Me too. Although he did give me something right before he disappeared.
"
,,
7,2,"What?
"
,,
7,2,"Something very special Lois.
"
,,
7,2,"What is it dad?
"
,,
7,2,"What? You haven't heard?
"
,,
7,2,"Crap!
"
,,
7,3,"Okay, everyone. Hurry up and hand in you oscar picks before it starts.
"
,,
7,3,"Ladies and gentlemen, Scarlett Johanson and for some reason Stewe Bushemi.
"
,,
7,3,"Man, look at this Stewe Buscemi.
"
,,
7,3,"Everyone of his teeth is in business for itself.
"
,,
7,3,"You know, Stewe, the artdirector's job
"
,,
7,3," is never an easy one.
"
,,
7,3,"That's right, Scarlett, but this year--
"
,,
7,3,"Hey, where are you going?
"
,,
7,3,"I'm going to the Elton John party.
"
,,
7,3,"What the hell? I told you, we're staying for the governor's ball.
"
,,
7,3,"And I told you, Tim, we would see how the evening plays out.
"
,,
7,3,"Peter, may I use your restroom?
"
,,
7,3,"I took a lots of any stool hardner (?), ooh.
"
,,
7,3,"And they're fighting it out in there.
"
,,
7,3,"Yeah, it's upstairs, Mort.
"
,,
7,3,"Oh, boy! I hope there's scale in there.
"
,,
7,3,"I'd like to have before and after on this one.
"
,,
7,3,"I'll be out in a minute.
"
,,
7,3,"She said she'll be out in a minute.
"
,,
7,3,"Oh, I hope there's another bathroom in there.
"
,,
7,3,"Oh god!
"
,,
7,3,"Oh, thank god, a porto party (?).
"
,,
7,3,"Dad, mr. Goldman never drank his Ensure.
"
,,
7,3,"Can I have it even know it's dinner time?
"
,,
7,3,"Sure Chris. Drink Ensure as a meal.
"
,,
7,3,"Or inbetween meals.
"
,,
7,3,"Or when you're on the go.
"
,,
7,3," Is Mort still in the bathroom?
"
,,
7,3," I'll go see if he's all right.
"
,,
7,3,"Mort?
"
,,
7,3,"Hello?
"
,,
7,3,"Mort?
"
,,
7,3,"Hey! Hey-hey-hey-hey!
"
,,
7,3,"What are you doing in my room?
"
,,
7,3,"Don't touch my stuff with you dirty walking on the streets paws.
"
,,
7,3,"I'm looking for Mort. He came up here an hour ago and never came back down.
"
,,
7,3," O-oh.
"
,,
7,3," What?
"
,,
7,3,"My time machine. It's been activated.
"
,,
7,3,"Time machine? I didn't know you've had a time machine.
"
,,
7,3,"Yeah, built it after I got bored with that european ""see and say"".
"
,,
7,3,"The pig goes-- Wank!
"
,,
7,3,"The cow goes-- Shazoo!
"
,,
7,3,"It most certainly does not.
"
,,
7,3,"The ruster goes-- Kikkery-gee!
"
,,
7,3,"Where? Where does the ruster say that?
"
,,
7,3,"The monkey goes-- Ma-kak!
"
,,
7,3,"Oh, no-no-no! It does not.
"
,,
7,3,"The elephant goes-- Fuamp!
"
,,
7,3,"Oh yeah, kinda.
"
,,
7,3,"Stewie, do you think Mort might have accidently stumbled into the time machine?
"
,,
7,3,"Yeah, I suppose it's possible.
"
,,
7,3,"Let's ask Rick Moranis and the backup singers from ""Little Shop of Horrors""
"
,,
7,3,"Da-rum.
"
,,
7,3,"I saw a red-headed guy come up here about an hour ago.
"
,,
7,3,"Mort ...
"
,,
7,3,"He seemed to be in a rush and had a pain look on his face.
"
,,
7,3,"Had to poop...
"
,,
7,3,"And he stepped into that box there and suddenly there was a big flash of light.
"
,,
7,3," Oh my god! Stewie we have to get him back. Where did the machine sent him?
"
,,
7,3," I don't know.
"
,,
7,3,"How- How can you not know? It's a time machine.
"
,,
7,3,"Doesn't it have like display that tells the year or something?
"
,,
7,3,"Oh, I'm sorry Brian, is my time machine not as good as your time machine?
"
,,
7,3,"Oh, yeah, oh. You probably got a way better time machine. Yeah.
"
,,
7,3,"Stupid dog!
"
,,
7,3,"Well then-- Can't you just press a couple of buttons and bring him back?
"
,,
7,3,"No, he can't just come back. He needs the return pad.
"
,,
7,3,"Oh, we can't just leave Mort back in time.
"
,,
7,3,"That'd be more irresponsible that silent movie porn.
"
,,
7,3,"All right. We'll go get him. But remember Brian, don't touch anything when we're in the past.
"
,,
7,3,"Even stepping on a mosquito could create a chain reaction that drastically alters the present.
"
,,
7,3," Really?
"
,,
7,3," Nah, you can do whatever you want. C'mon!
"
,,
7,3,"Okay. If everything worked properly this should be the exact time and place that Mort was sent to.
"
,,
7,3," Now we just got to figure out where we are.
"
,,
7,3," Or when we are.
"
,,
7,3,"Oh, that's such a douche time travellers thing to say.
"
,,
7,3,"Shazoo!
"
,,
7,3,"Okay. We're somewere in Europe.
"
,,
7,3,"Aha! Look Brian! This trail of used tissues should lead us right to Mort.
"
,,
7,3,"Or to Quagmire.
"
,,
7,3,"Aha-ha-ha-ha. Oh, he's gross.
"
,,
7,3,"Warsaw. Well, at least we know where we are.
"
,,
7,3,"And so we had encrucified. But this doesn't leave this room.
"
,,
7,3,"Anyway, the point is, may Haim and Sarah have many wonderful years together. Amen.
"
,,
7,3,"Oh, excuse me! We're looking for mr. Goldman.
"
,,
7,3,"Mr. Mort Goldman.
"
,,
7,3,"He's a small business owner. Tends to wine a lot. Kinda of hypochondriac.
"
,,
7,3,"Oh no, you can't put you hand back up after you put it down. You know-- Never mind.
"
,,
7,3,"Stewie look at this. September 1st, 1939. 
"
,,
7,3,"There's something about that date.
"
,,
7,3,"I now pronounce you man and wife. Mazl tov! Now step on the glass.
"
,,
7,3,"Oh, but be careful though. At my wedding I cut myself on the glass.
"
,,
7,3,"And when I've got to Palm Beach for the honeymoon I had to put a wonder bread bag on my foot to keep the sand out.
"
,,
7,3,"Mazl tov!
"
,,
7,3,"Oh, Mort, thank god.
"
,,
7,3,"Brian and Stewie? You're in heaven too?
"
,,
7,3,"Mort, this isn't heaven. You've time travelled into the past.
"
,,
7,3,"What? How is that possible?
"
,,
7,3,"Just trust me, we're here to bring you back home.
"
,,
7,3,"But it's got to be heaven, Brian. Look!
"
,,
7,3," There's my frugal aunt Ruth, my drifty(?) uncle Isaac, my bogen hunting aunt Flo,
"
,,
7,3,"and my great aunt Vera, who didn't like to spend a lot on anything.
"
,,
7,3,"C'mon Mort, we gotta get out of here.
"
,,
7,3,"But Brian, when am I gonna have another chance to see my grandpa Haim's wedding with my own eyes.
"
,,
7,3,"Yes, you know, he's right, Brian. Besides, I've never been to hebrew wedding.
"
,,
7,3,"Well, I guess we could stay a little longer.
"
,,
7,3,"Oh, wonderful. I wanna be hoisted up on the chair and see what it feels like to be top jew.
"
,,
7,3,"O-oh.
"
,,
7,3,"I knew there was something about this date.
"
,,
7,3,"September 1st, 1939. This is the german invasion of Poland.
"
,,
7,3,"It's also the exact day and year that Rene Russo was born.
"
,,
7,3,"Stewie, we gotta get out of here fast.
"
,,
7,3," Quick, set up the return pad and let's get back to our own time.
"
,,
7,3," Right.
"
,,
7,3," What's wrong? Why we're still here?
"
,,
7,3," I don't know.
"
,,
7,3,"Stewie, it's not working.
"
,,
7,3,"Yeah. And you know what's not gonna fix it? Your shouting.
"
,,
7,3,"Aw god! Should we ask somebody for help?
"
,,
7,3,"Yeah, right. How many pollocks does it take to fix the time machine? Let's find out.
"
,,
7,3,"No, we can't stay here. We'll have to get Mort to England. It's the only place he'll be safe from the nazis.
"
,,
7,3,"Oh dear, awful those nazis. If they catch me, they'll beat me unmerciful 
"
,,
7,3,"and rub dirt my assneck(?) all over my assy nipples.
"
,,
7,3,"What?
"
,,
7,3,"Juden. Ruber der schmutzen auf deine assneck.
"
,,
7,3,"All right, there's the checkpoint. If we can get past it, we're out of occupied Poland.
"
,,
7,3,"Right. Mort, you're set?
"
,,
7,3,"Oh god. I hope this works.
"
,,
7,3,"Hello. We'd like to leave Poland now.
"
,,
7,3,"And we'll be bringing our friend, who's absolutely 100% not jewish.
"
,,
7,3,"Hey, how about the Jesus, huh? What a guy!
"
,,
7,3,"Father, we are so glad you're here.
"
,,
7,3,"We needed to conduct last right for our friend over there.
"
,,
7,3,"Oh-- Well, ah-- I suppose, eh--
"
,,
7,3,"Dear god! Um-- Non jewish god, be a mensch--
"
,,
7,3,"I mean a good guy, 'cause it says in the old book-- Not so old though.
"
,,
7,3,"You know still good, still good-- Uh, still something good thing to say--
"
,,
7,3,"We pray in the name of you and of your son, who died
"
,,
7,3,"in a freak accident, that you can't really blame on anyone.
"
,,
7,3,"Take this man up to your retail pain place.
"
,,
7,3,"Are you sure you are real priest?
"
,,
7,3,"Yeah, I can vouch for him, he's real.
"
,,
7,3,"He's molested me many-many times.
"
,,
7,3,"Sorry, I'm late. I was busy doing-- am--
"
,,
7,3,"innocent non-molested things.
"
,,
7,3,"Wait a minute. Two priests? That is impossible!
"
,,
7,3,"This collier comes right off.
"
,,
7,3,"This is a filthy jew!
"
,,
7,3,"Oh boy, you, you are, you, you, you should be glad, your HR person was not around here then.
"
,,
7,3,"Run!
"
,,
7,3,"Hey, poppy, I need to borrow this.
"
,,
7,3,"Das poop!
"
,,
7,3,"Well, nazis, that's refreshing.
"
,,
7,3,"All right, on three we make to the closest U-boat.
"
,,
7,3,"Ah, unsere untersee-boot sind stielen mit eine dog und baby und ardga(?) fonkel.
"
,,
7,3,"Everybody hang on.
"
,,
7,3,"We're being pursued by two objects.
"
,,
7,3,"Looks like one's another U-boat.
"
,,
7,3,"The other appears to be Terence Trent D'Arby.
"
,,
7,3,"Fire!
"
,,
7,3," O-oh.
"
,,
7,3," What?
"
,,
7,3,"Hold on to something.
"
,,
7,3,"Brian, I've got an idea.
"
,,
7,3,"It's a long shot but it just might work.
"
,,
7,3," See that newspaper?
"
,,
7,3," Yeah.
"
,,
7,3,"Staff it in the waist-tube.
"
,,
7,3,"Oh my god! It's England. We've reached England. We're saved.
"
,,
7,3,"Ah, London in war time.
"
,,
7,3,"This is history right here, Brian.
"
,,
7,3,"And look, there's Winston Churchill.
"
,,
7,3,"Maybe we'll get an upclose look at his legendary wit.
"
,,
7,3,"Ah, Winston, drunk again, I see?
"
,,
7,3,"Yeah, well, and you are fat bitch.
"
,,
7,3,"Wickedly funny!
"
,,
7,3,"Hm, I guess history is just wittled it down to the gyms.
"
,,
7,3,"Why isn't the time machine working?
"
,,
7,3,"I'm working on it Mort, all right?
"
,,
7,3," Aw, here's the problem.
"
,,
7,3," What? What is it?
"
,,
7,3,"The transfer circuts are powered by uranium and this thing is taped out.
"
,,
7,3,"Wait a minute, are you saying we need to find some uranium?
"
,,
7,3,"I'm afraid so. But where do we find uranium in WW2 Europe?
"
,,
7,3,"There's only one place. At the top secret atomic research facility.
"
,,
7,3,"In Berlin.
"
,,
7,3,"Wait a minute, germany is building weapons of mass destruction?
"
,,
7,3,"Why doesn't it matter then to go there and kick their asses?
"
,,
7,3,"I don't know. Maybe because they don't have any oil?
"
,,
7,3,"Aw, clap-clap-clap-clap-clap.
"
,,
7,3,"I don't know. I don't wanna do this.
"
,,
7,3,"Mort, Berlin is the closest place we're gonna find uranium in this time.
"
,,
7,3,"It's the only way to get home.
"
,,
7,3,"Men, as officers of the royal airforce, you're the very best in the world.
"
,,
7,3,"However this mission to Germany will not be an easy one.
"
,,
7,3,"Four and a half of every five of you will not return.
"
,,
7,3,"Half of Jenson there, I can tell you, it gets pretty sticky(?).
"
,,
7,3,"But I've never lost me good spirit sir ever.
"
,,
7,3,"So let's get up there, be safe and get back to the big fat pigs of wives we have waiting at home.
"
,,
7,3,"Pardon me, sir. I'd like to join.
"
,,
7,3,"What are your qualifications?
"
,,
7,3,"I have british accent, I'm possibly homosexual, I've never brushed my teeth and my wife is grossly(?).
"
,,
7,3,"Bombs away.
"
,,
7,3," Talk to me, Gus.
"
,,
7,3," Please don't call me that.
"
,,
7,3,"You're my eyes, Gus. Keep an eye out for this crowds.
"
,,
7,3,"O-oh, germans dead ahead.
"
,,
7,3,"Oh no, it's another wave of fighters. We're outnumbered.
"
,,
7,3,"Oh no, we're not.
"
,,
7,3,"Stand by, my hohmen(?). DIE!!!
"
,,
7,3,"Oh my god and baby Jesus, we're going down.
"
,,
7,3,"Quick, get the parachutes.
"
,,
7,3,"There are no parachutes, all I could find was this.
"
,,
7,3,"A raft? We're not sinking.
"
,,
7,3,"We're crushing!
"
,,
7,3,"There it is. Berlin.
"
,,
7,3,"So, this is Berlin, huh? Doesn't seem so bad.
"
,,
7,3,"Dear god, this place is nightmarish. Look at the offencive way they draw a jewish people.
"
,,
7,3,"It's here. The uranium lab is in here.
"
,,
7,3,"Hey, psst, fellas. You wanna get free caricature?
"
,,
7,3,"Whooo--
"
,,
7,3,"Yeah!
"
,,
7,3,"I want to be a shcateboarder.
"
,,
7,3,"Eh, there's something on here.
"
,,
7,3,"Huh, that's weird.
"
,,
7,3,"All right, c'mon. Let's get inside that lab.
"
,,
7,3,"Hey guys!
"
,,
7,3," Hitler!
"
,,
7,3," How is it going, mr. Hitler?
"
,,
7,3,"Oh, it's a doggy-dog rike(?) and I'm wearing a bacon pants.
"
,,
7,3,"So, how's the atomic bomb coming?
"
,,
7,3,"It's coming, it's coming. There's some problems,
"
,,
7,3,"we have much better luck developing this impressive collection of luftballons.
"
,,
7,3,"Oh damn!
"
,,
7,3,"Well, I guess we'll just get you back to work.
"
,,
7,3,"Oh, I almost forgot, I can suppose you boys have some uranium I could borrow?
"
,,
7,3,"Oh, of course. Give him some uranium, Min Joe Green.
"
,,
7,3,"Likee. Catch.
"
,,
7,3,"Thanks, Min Joe.
"
,,
7,3,"He's not really Min at all.
"
,,
7,3,"Nah, he's a nice guy.
"
,,
7,3,"Okay, the time machine is refuelled.
"
,,
7,3,"Let's find a safe spot and make the trip back home.
"
,,
7,3,"Arrest him! Arrest all sree.
"
,,
7,3,"Zis fills are making a mockery of our Reich. Execute them.
"
,,
7,3," Unless--
"
,,
7,3," Unless what?
"
,,
7,3,"Unless they can sing a charming musical number.
"
,,
7,3,"[sings]
"
,,
7,3,"Dammit, what are you do? Just get in the fucking time machine.
"
,,
7,3,"We did it! We're home. Everything's fine.
"
,,
7,3," Uh, well, not quite.
"
,,
7,3," What do you mean?
"
,,
7,3,"Don't you a little nervous that Mort knows all about this stuff?
"
,,
7,3,"Ah, I'm one step ahead of you, Brian.
"
,,
7,3,"You see, we've arrived thirty seconds before Mort came up to use the bathroom.
"
,,
7,3,"Only this time things are gonna play out a bit differently.
"
,,
7,3," Can I poop in here?
"
,,
7,3," No!
"

7,4," That would be nice for a short period.
"
,,
7,4,"I tell you, I need this.
"
,,
7,4,"I've had a really stressfull morning.
"
,,
7,4,"Wait a minute, Doc! Are you telling me
"
,,
7,4,"that its 8:25?
"
,,
7,4," Precisely!
"
,,
7,4," Damn... I'm late for school!
"
,,
7,4,"Okay. Why don't you just get
"
,,
7,4,"yourself settled up on that table.
"
,,
7,4," I'll give you a minute.
"
,,
7,4," Eh... What am I supposed...
"
,,
7,4," You ready in there?
"
,,
7,4," Yep.
"
,,
7,4,"fake poo on the floor.</i>
"
,,
7,4,"Huh, this is more like it.
"
,,
7,4,"Is the music okay?
"
,,
7,4,"Actually, would you
"
,,
7,4,"mind tuning it to 97.1?
"
,,
7,4,"Up next the music of the eyes list</i>
"
,,
7,4,"here is some Marvin Gaye</i>
"
,,
7,4,"Oh, that's what I'm talking about.
"
,,
7,4,"Ohhh, this is long overdue.
"
,,
7,4,"There's nothing like a good suit massage.
"
,,
7,4,"Focus on the lapels. That's
"
,,
7,4,"where I carry most of my stress.
"
,,
7,4,"Okay, here's one. If you were gay
"
,,
7,4,"and you had to have sex with either
"
,,
7,4,"John Forsythe or Sean Connery,
"
,,
7,4,"who would it be?
"
,,
7,4," Oh, that's easy, John Forsythe.
"
,,
7,4," Yeah, John Forsythe.
"
,,
7,4," John Forsythe, absolutely.
"
,,
7,4,"That's so funny, I would also say
"
,,
7,4,"John Forsythe, I was just curious.
"
,,
7,4,"Yeah, I mean Sean Connery
"
,,
7,4,"is just so... O-oh...
"
,,
7,4,"Oh God, I am so sorry!
"
,,
7,4,"It's too late. The damage is done.
"
,,
7,4,"Hey Chris, you know what I just got?
"
,,
7,4,"The boxset of Lord Of The Rings.
"
,,
7,4,"It's awesome.
"
,,
7,4,"Yeah, but you remember the giant
"
,,
7,4,"eagle they rode in the first one
"
,,
7,4,"and then rescues them at
"
,,
7,4,"the end of the third one?
"
,,
7,4,"Yeah, yeah...
"
,,
7,4,"Yeah, why didn't they just
"
,,
7,4,"fly the eagle to Mordor
"
,,
7,4,"instead of spending three
"
,,
7,4,"movies walking there.
"
,,
7,4,"That's not what it's about, Chris.
"
,,
7,4,"It's about the quest.
"
,,
7,4,"Oh, I'm not arguing that with you, I'm
"
,,
7,4,"just saying there's hole in the story.
"
,,
7,4," Huh... Have you ever seen Krull?
"
,,
7,4," No.
"
,,
7,4,"Yeah, you don't need to see Krull.
"
,,
7,4,"All right guys, the best thing you can
"
,,
7,4,"do for your body after a massage
"
,,
7,4,"is hot coffee, alcohol and slim jims.
"
,,
7,4,"Oh, dad, I'm glad you're here.
"
,,
7,4," There's something I need to ask you.
"
,,
7,4," What is it, Chris?
"
,,
7,4," Well, um... Today in gym class
"
,,
7,4,"I've noticed one of my testicles
"
,,
7,4,"went up inside my body
"
,,
7,4,"and hasn't come back out yet.
"
,,
7,4,"And I'm a little scared.
"
,,
7,4,"Uh, Sir, this employee just made
"
,,
7,4,"a sexual remark to me.
"
,,
7,4,"No, dad, I'm really worried.
"
,,
7,4,"Look, is that normal?
"
,,
7,4,"Ah, ah! Sir, sir! Your employee
"
,,
7,4,"is exposing himself to me!
"
,,
7,4," But dad!
"
,,
7,4," You got a lawsuit on your hands, mister.
"
,,
7,4,"Whoa, whoa, okay, look, look.
"
,,
7,4,"If you'd be willing to forget
"
,,
7,4,"this whole thing happened,
"
,,
7,4,"I'll give you this gas card.
"
,,
7,4,"Unlimited Free Gas for a year?!
"
,,
7,4,"Just 'cause I threatened to sue you?
"
,,
7,4,"Well, that and you're not the worst
"
,,
7,4,"looking guy who's ever come in there.
"
,,
7,4,"That's what I wanted to hear!
"
,,
7,4,"Wow, Peter, a free gas card!
"
,,
7,4,"This could save us a lot of money.
"
,,
7,4,"Yeah, everyone except Brian 'cause
"
,,
7,4,"he bought a Prius, what a dumbass.
"
,,
7,4,"What? What? What I miss?
"
,,
7,4,"Are we laughing at Brian?
"
,,
7,4,"Ha-ha, Brian, you're suck!
"
,,
7,4,"What the devil is in here?!
"
,,
7,4,"Oh, I threw out all your apple juice,
"
,,
7,4,"Stewie. We're a gas family now.
"
,,
7,4,"You put gasoline in Stewie's bottle?!
"
,,
7,4,"You damn fool!
"
,,
7,4,"You're more useless than Aquaman!
"
,,
7,4,"Help! Somebody help me!
"
,,
7,4,"Rape!
"
,,
7,4,"Scream all you want,
"
,,
7,4,"nobody can hear you out here.
"
,,
7,4,"I can!
"
,,
7,4,"Aquaman, help!
"
,,
7,4,"Hey! Hey! Hey, let her go!
"
,,
7,4,"Or what?
"
,,
7,4,"Or... Or... I don't know man, but...
"
,,
7,4,"but you're lucky you're not
"
,,
7,4,"doing it over here... in the ocean.
"
,,
7,4,"Or else... I would stop you.
"
,,
7,4,"For God's sake! Help! Do something!
"
,,
7,4,"Ah, if you don't like starfish you're
"
,,
7,4,"gonna be mad about what I just did.
"
,,
7,4,"Oh God! Help!
"
,,
7,4,"Ah, you're in for it now, buddy.
"
,,
7,4,"I've got like five fish coming to help.
"
,,
7,4,"Aw, aw, here they are.
"
,,
7,4,"Help, he's hurting me!
"
,,
7,4,"Well, maybe you shouldn't of let him on.
"
,,
7,4,"Peter, what the hell is that?
"
,,
7,4,"It's a space shulttle, Lois.
"
,,
7,4,"I figured, with unlimited free gas I can
"
,,
7,4,"finally afford to go into space.
"
,,
7,4,"Why is it every time I open this door
"
,,
7,4,"you seem to be in some ridiculous
"
,,
7,4,"vehicle you inexplicibly acquired?
"
,,
7,4,"I've got this at a NASA auction
"
,,
7,4,"for next to nothing.
"
,,
7,4,"They were gonna scrap it cause of some
"
,,
7,4,"minor mechanical problem or something.
"
,,
7,4,"Instead they sold it to me.
"
,,
7,4,"Very simple explaination.
"
,,
7,4,"I do not want you trying
"
,,
7,4,"to fly that thing...
"
,,
7,4,"you're not even a trained astronaut!
"
,,
7,4,"Relax, Lois, nothing bad ever
"
,,
7,4,"happens to space shuttles.
"
,,
7,4,"Now stand back!
"
,,
7,4,"[3 days later]
"
,,
7,4,"I'm back from space, everybody.
"
,,
7,4,"You got lucky, Peter.
"
,,
7,4,"How was it, dad?
"
,,
7,4,"Oh, mind-boggling, Chris.
"
,,
7,4,"Barrelling around the Earth
"
,,
7,4,"at 5 miles per second.
"
,,
7,4,"Watching the sunrise over
"
,,
7,4,"the Sea of Japan.
"
,,
7,4,"It's indescribable.
"
,,
7,4,"Plus I've had a lot of time to
"
,,
7,4,"rub one out which in space is great,
"
,,
7,4,"except after a while it's like
"
,,
7,4,"living in a snow globe.
"
,,
7,4,"Peter, instead of wasting your
"
,,
7,4,"free gas on a series of comedic
"
,,
7,4,"stunts why don't use it
"
,,
7,4,"more constructively?
"
,,
7,4,"I mean we can take a family vacation.
"
,,
7,4,"That's a great idea, mom.
"
,,
7,4,"Hey, maybe we can go to
"
,,
7,4,"the island from Lost.
"
,,
7,4,"No, I don't wanna listen
"
,,
7,4,"Matthew Fox's heavy breathing.
"
,,
7,4,"Keith... You don't get it.
"
,,
7,4,"We are the island!
"
,,
7,4,"Hand me that paper bag.
"
,,
7,4,"Jack, that's got my poop in it.
"
,,
7,4,"I know... I know.
"
,,
7,4,"It's got a hit of coconut in it.
"
,,
7,4,"And something else.
"
,,
7,4,"But that's part of the mystery.
"
,,
7,4,"All aboard for the Grand Canyon!
"
,,
7,4,"I know you're tired, Stewie, but
"
,,
7,4,"you sleep all you want in the car.
"
,,
7,4,"Uh, 6 am. I shouldn't have stayed up
"
,,
7,4,"all night listening to persian radio.
"
,,
7,4,"left side of the road at a 120 km</i>
"
,,
7,4,"turn up the decibels</i>
"
,,
7,4,"What's with all those birds?
"
,,
7,4,"My tropical bird collection...
"
,,
7,4,"Just in case.
"
,,
7,4,"Just in case what?
"
,,
7,4,"We're not gonna need
"
,,
7,4,"a dozen tropical birds.
"
,,
7,4,"Oh, I was not aware that you
"
,,
7,4,"can see the future, Lois.
"
,,
7,4,"Can I go ahead and get
"
,,
7,4,"tomorrow's lottery number?
"
,,
7,4,"Stupid woman.
"
,,
7,4,"Peter, you are not putting
"
,,
7,4,"those birds in the car.
"
,,
7,4,"Oh, well then I guess we're
"
,,
7,4,"not going on vacation.
"
,,
7,4,"Oh, good, then I'm going back to bed.
"
,,
7,4,"All right, Peter, you can bring this stupid birds.
"
,,
7,4,"Yeah, you're letting me be myself.
"
,,
7,4,"All right, everybody, let's go!
"
,,
7,4,"All right, everybody, off we go!
"
,,
7,4,"We are gonna have such a great time...
"
,,
7,4," Hello.
"
,,
7,4," Hey, Peter, what's up?
"
,,
7,4,"Hey, Quagmire, just taking the
"
,,
7,4,"family on vacation.
"
,,
7,4,"Oh, that's good.
"
,,
7,4,"some fatass driving too slow.</i>
"
,,
7,4,"Hang on, Quagmire, some jerk
"
,,
7,4,"behind me is honking his horn.
"
,,
7,4,"some fatass just flipped me off!</i>
"
,,
7,4,"I've gotta kick this guy's ass.</i>
"
,,
7,4," Yeah, me too.</i>
"
,,
7,4," Good luck in yours.</i>
"
,,
7,4,"Lois? I'm awake, Lois.
"
,,
7,4,"Lois!
"
,,
7,4,"Lois?
"
,,
7,4,"Where the devil is everyone?
"
,,
7,4,"This place is more deserted than
"
,,
7,4,"James Gandolfini's workout room.
"
,,
7,4,"Just waitin' for my breakfast.
"
,,
7,4,"Lois!!!
"
,,
7,4,"I know how to get her attention.
"
,,
7,4,"Lois, I'm about to drink my first soda,
"
,,
7,4,"better come stop me.
"
,,
7,4,"Mmm, that must be the sugar.
"
,,
7,4,"Oh God, that's good!
"
,,
7,4,"Rupert, suddenly I want to run!
"
,,
7,4,"Chase me!
"
,,
7,4,"Oh, now I'm sad.
"
,,
7,4,"Brian, do me a favor and
"
,,
7,4,"check on Stewie, would you?
"
,,
7,4,"He's fine.
"
,,
7,4,"Hey, what do you say we
"
,,
7,4,"sing a driving song?
"
,,
7,4,"Some say Love-e-e...
"
,,
7,4,"It is a river...
"
,,
7,4,"That drowns...
"
,,
7,4,"The tender reef...
"
,,
7,4,"Some say Love-e-e...
"
,,
7,4,"It is a razor...
"
,,
7,4,"That leaves your soul to bleed...
"
,,
7,4,"When the night has been too lonely...
"
,,
7,4,"And the road has been too long...
"
,,
7,4,"And you think that love is only
"
,,
7,4,"For the lucky and the strong...
"
,,
7,4,"Just remember...
"
,,
7,4,"In the winter...
"
,,
7,4,"Far beneath...
"
,,
7,4,"The bitter snows...
"
,,
7,4,"Lies the seed that with the sun's love...
"
,,
7,4,"In the spring...
"
,,
7,4,"Becomes the rose...
"
,,
7,4,"Okay, that was good, that was good!
"
,,
7,4,"Chris, I think you were a
"
,,
7,4,"little early at start of bar 4.
"
,,
7,4,"I don't know.
"
,,
7,4,"How'd that sound from your end?
"
,,
7,4,"Sounded great out here.
"
,,
7,4,"You want another?
"
,,
7,4,"No, if that's works for you, we're fine.
"
,,
7,4," All good on my end.
"
,,
7,4," All right, that's a take.
"
,,
7,4,"There's no sign of them anywhere!
"
,,
7,4,"Meg? Chris? Brian?
"
,,
7,4,"They're gone! I'm all alone!
"
,,
7,4,"I can do whatever I want!
"
,,
7,4,"I'm gonna take Brians novel
"
,,
7,4,"and replace every use of the
"
,,
7,4,"word ""and"" with the word ""fart"".
"
,,
7,4,"""The young soldier fart his brother
"
,,
7,4,"looked at each other
"
,,
7,4,"fart both knew that with
"
,,
7,4,"love fart truth fart courage
"
,,
7,4,"they would both emerge
"
,,
7,4,"st-fart-ing on their feet.""
"
,,
7,4,"Eh, that one didn't work.
"
,,
7,4,"Well, let's see what facinating
"
,,
7,4,"pubescent treasures
"
,,
7,4,"Chris has got hidden away.
"
,,
7,4,"Ooh, Hustler Magazine!
"
,,
7,4,"I finally get to see what
"
,,
7,4,"a vagina looks...
"
,,
7,4,"Oh God! Oh my God! Oh my God!
"
,,
7,4,"You... Can't hurt... Anyone...
"
,,
7,4,"Anymore...
"
,,
7,4,"[Ground zero]
"
,,
7,4,"Why are we in New York?
"
,,
7,4,"I thought we were going
"
,,
7,4,"to the Grand Canyon.
"
,,
7,4,"Well, I just thought we should
"
,,
7,4,"stop and pay our respects.
"
,,
7,4,"Ground zero.
"
,,
7,4,"So this is where the first guy got AIDS.
"
,,
7,4,"Peter, this is the site of 9/11 terrorists' attacks.
"
,,
7,4," Ah, so Saddam Hussein did this?
"
,,
7,4," No.
"
,,
7,4," The Iraqi army?
"
,,
7,4," No.
"
,,
7,4," Some guys from Iraq?
"
,,
7,4," No.
"
,,
7,4,"That one lady who visited
"
,,
7,4,"Iraq that one time?
"
,,
7,4,"No. Peter, Iraq had nothing
"
,,
7,4,"to do with this,
"
,,
7,4,"it was bunch of Saudi-Arabians,
"
,,
7,4,"Lebanese and Egyptians
"
,,
7,4,"financed by a Saudi-Arabian guy
"
,,
7,4,"living in Afghanistan
"
,,
7,4,"and sheltered by Pakistanis.
"
,,
7,4,"So, you're saying we need
"
,,
7,4,"to invade Iran?
"
,,
7,4,"Wake up, Stewie, let's get you out
"
,,
7,4,"of that seat and into a fresh diaper.
"
,,
7,4,"Oh my God!
"
,,
7,4,"Peter, Stewie's not in the car!
"
,,
7,4,"Oh my God, we must
"
,,
7,4,"have left him at home!
"
,,
7,4,"Oh my God.
"
,,
7,4,"That... Is... Hilarious.
"
,,
7,4,"He is probably freaking out.
"
,,
7,4,"God, I would give anything
"
,,
7,4,"to see his face right now.
"
,,
7,4,"He's... He's probably all like
"
,,
7,4,"""Whe... Where the deuce is everyone?"".
"
,,
7,4,"Well, I can't really do a good Stewie.
"
,,
7,4,"Oh my God, what kind of a mother am I?
"
,,
7,4,"Peter, we gotta go home right now!
"
,,
7,4,"Oh great, Lois. Now we gotta bail
"
,,
7,4,"on the whole vacation. This sucks!
"
,,
7,4,"Now every time I come back to this place
"
,,
7,4,"it's gonna be associated with
"
,,
7,4,"one particular bad memory.
"
,,
7,4,"Actually we could call
"
,,
7,4,"Quagmire and Cleveland.
"
,,
7,4,"They can go over and check on Stewie.
"
,,
7,4,"They'll probably even be willing to
"
,,
7,4,"look after him 'till we got home.
"
,,
7,4,"Well, okay, I guess so.
"
,,
7,4,"Yeah, Quagmire and Cleveland
"
,,
7,4,"are great with kids.
"
,,
7,4,"Like Robin Williams in Patch Adams.
"
,,
7,4,"Huh. Everybody's lying around in here.
"
,,
7,4,"Liar, liar, pants on fire.
"
,,
7,4,"What am I in congress? Ho-ho.
"
,,
7,4,"See, laughter is the best medicine.
"
,,
7,4,"Please, sir, I'm in so much pain!
"
,,
7,4,"Shut up and listen to my material!
"
,,
7,4,"Huh, what's this? Bedpan? Peter pan?
"
,,
7,4,"Oh, next stop is Neverland.
"
,,
7,4,"Come Wendy, fly with me. Ho-ho.
"
,,
7,4,"Hmm, I've never executed
"
,,
7,4,"a diaper change before.
"
,,
7,4,"Of course how hard could it be?
"
,,
7,4,"You just unfasten these things
"
,,
7,4,"and lay back with your legs in the air
"
,,
7,4,"and let nature do the rest.
"
,,
7,4,"Hm, it's still there. Usually the doodey's
"
,,
7,4,"disappeared by now but it hasn't.
"
,,
7,4,"Intruders!
"
,,
7,4,"Stewie, you in there?
"
,,
7,4,"You think he's here?
"
,,
7,4,"Oh God, it's Cleveland and Bob Hope.
"
,,
7,4,"Oh well, the damage is done.
"
,,
7,4,"Better get 'em out of here.
"
,,
7,4,"Perhaps I'll shackle them
"
,,
7,4,"in the basement.
"
,,
7,4,"With a 24 hour broadcast of
"
,,
7,4,"the DirecTV help channel.
"
,,
7,4,"What the hell? Where are we?
"
,,
7,4,"is easier than you might think.</i>
"
,,
7,4,"These buttons at the top control volume,
"
,,
7,4,"channel and the power on your receiver.
"
,,
7,4,"To see what else is playing
"
,,
7,4,"just press Guide.
"
,,
7,4,"And then scroll through
"
,,
7,4,"the on-screen menu
"
,,
7,4,"by pushing the arrow-button.
"
,,
7,4,"Now that we've learned the basics...
"
,,
7,4,"This maybe kinda messed up but...
"
,,
7,4,"Am I the only one getting
"
,,
7,4,"a boner right now?
"
,,
7,4,"Is there anything that doesn't
"
,,
7,4,"give you a boner, Glenn?
"
,,
7,4,"People are used the word ""rubbish""
"
,,
7,4,"when they mean garbage.
"
,,
7,4," Really?
"
,,
7,4," Yep. Not even a wiggle down there.
"
,,
7,4,"Peter, it's been 8 hours and I haven't
"
,,
7,4,"heared from Cleveland or Quagmire.
"
,,
7,4,"I even tried Joe.
"
,,
7,4,"This is my wheelchair! There are many
"
,,
7,4,"like it but this one is mine!
"
,,
7,4,"Without me my wheelchair is useless!
"
,,
7,4,"Without my wheelchair I am useless!
"
,,
7,4," Shut up!
"
,,
7,4," Okay.
"
,,
7,4,"This sucks!
"
,,
7,4,"I wanna see the Grand Canyon!
"
,,
7,4,"I'm sorry but we are not leaving Stewie by himself.
"
,,
7,4,"We're going home.
"
,,
7,4,"No way!
"
,,
7,4,"Those guys have TV in their car!
"
,,
7,4,"He-he. They're watching
"
,,
7,4,"Operation Dumbo 6 with Don Nuts.

"
,,
7,4,"impregnate this elephant
"
,,
7,4,"or the entire species
"
,,
7,4,"will become extinct.
"
,,
7,4,"You mean I gotta put
"
,,
7,4,"this thing in that thing?!
"
,,
7,4,"Well, this is the job that's
"
,,
7,4,"not worth the money!
"
,,
7,4,"Peter, watch the road!
"
,,
7,4,"Lois, get off my back, will ya?
"
,,
7,4,"I'm trying to watch TV.
"
,,
7,4,"I swear to God, sometimes I think your
"
,,
7,4,"head's screwed on backwards...
"
,,
7,4,"I mean, do you have any idea...
"
,,
7,4,"Hey, crashy,
"
,,
7,4,"what are you doing down there?
"
,,
7,4,"Well, Rupert, we're out of food,
"
,,
7,4,"diapers and just about everything else.
"
,,
7,4,"Which means I've got to get a job.
"
,,
7,4,"otherwise we'll be in worse shape
"
,,
7,4,"than Morbidly Obese Albert.
"
,,
7,4,"Hey, Morbidly Obese Albert,
"
,,
7,4,"we brought you some chocolate.
"
,,
7,4,"Huh, I can't eat those chocolates
"
,,
7,4,"on account of my diabetes.
"
,,
7,4,"Remember, they had to take my foot?
"
,,
7,4,"Look it on the bright side,
"
,,
7,4,"now you get your shoes half-price!
"
,,
7,4,"Alright, maybe I'll have one.
"
,,
7,4,"Welcome to McBurgertown.
"
,,
7,4,"Can I take your order?
"
,,
7,4,"Stewie, you've got to clean the bathroom!
"
,,
7,4,"No, no! I'm not going back in there.
"
,,
7,4,"Stewie, I'm not giving you a choice.
"
,,
7,4,"You've got to go clean that up.
"
,,
7,4,"No! No! It was literally only on the floor.
"
,,
7,4,"All right? There was no attempt
"
,,
7,4,"to get near the toilet.
"
,,
7,4,"It's like they just...
"
,,
7,4,"Pressed their buttocks against the wall.
"
,,
7,4,"The only part of the floor
"
,,
7,4,"that didn't have poo on it
"
,,
7,4," was the part that had baby on it.
"
,,
7,4," Go!
"
,,
7,4,"Peter, did you get the train tickets?
"
,,
7,4,"Uh, actually no, Lois.
"
,,
7,4,"There was a guy inside selling
"
,,
7,4,"shower curtain rings,
"
,,
7,4,"so I bought a bunch of those.
"
,,
7,4,"Peter! That was last of our cash!
"
,,
7,4,"These ones have helium in them,
"
,,
7,4,"so they're very light.
"
,,
7,4,"You are unbelieveable!
"
,,
7,4,"The last four days
"
,,
7,4,"have been a living hell!
"
,,
7,4,"Our baby is at home all by himself
"
,,
7,4,"yet instead of getting us home
"
,,
7,4,"you've managed to make things
"
,,
7,4,"worse at every turn!
"
,,
7,4,"A monkey would be a refreshing
"
,,
7,4,"step up from you!
"
,,
7,4,"A monkey would talk less!
"
,,
7,4,"Here's a little tip.
"
,,
7,4,"If your instinct tells you
"
,,
7,4,"to do something, don't do it.
"
,,
7,4,"If your instinct tells you
"
,,
7,4,"not to do something,
"
,,
7,4,"it's probably the right thing to do!
"
,,
7,4,"You wanna hurt me?
"
,,
7,4,"Go right ahead if it makes
"
,,
7,4,"you feel any better.
"
,,
7,4,"I'm an easy target...
"
,,
7,4,"Yeah, you're right.
"
,,
7,4,"I talk too much.
"
,,
7,4,"I also listen too much.
"
,,
7,4,"I could be a cold-hearted cynic like you.
"
,,
7,4,"But I don't like to hurt
"
,,
7,4,"people's feelings.
"
,,
7,4,"You think what you want about me,
"
,,
7,4,"I'm not changing.
"
,,
7,4,"I like... I like me.
"
,,
7,4,"My kids like me.
"
,,
7,4,"My friends like me.
"
,,
7,4,"'Cause I'm the real article.
"
,,
7,4,"What you see is what you get.
"
,,
7,4,"Movie references.
"
,,
7,4,"Guys! I found us a ride to Quahog
"
,,
7,4,"in the back of a truck! Hurry!
"
,,
7,4,"Ah, thank God!
"
,,
7,4,"C'mon let's head home before
"
,,
7,4,"Stewie gets hurt
"
,,
7,4,"like Fozzie Bear when he
"
,,
7,4,"went to Saudi Arabia.
"
,,
7,4,"Eh, It's good to worship Allah
"
,,
7,4,"'cause I used to worship Summer!
"
,,
7,4,"Wakka-wakka.
"
,,
7,4,"I once know a guy who was so arab...
"
,,
7,4,"How arab was he?
"
,,
7,4,"Eh, he was so arab that
"
,,
7,4,"everybody liked him and there
"
,,
7,4,"was nothing funny about him at all.
"
,,
7,4,"Stewie, can I see you in
"
,,
7,4,"my office for a second?
"
,,
7,4,"Oh, yeah, what's up, Eric?
"
,,
7,4,"Everything's ok?
"
,,
7,4,"Yeah, just come into my office.
"
,,
7,4,"Stewie, Shiwanda said she
"
,,
7,4,"saw you sneaking food.
"
,,
7,4,"Whaaaat?
"
,,
7,4,"She said she saw you in the back of
"
,,
7,4,"the kitchen sneaking a fish sandwich.
"
,,
7,4,"Oh, come on! Dude!
"
,,
7,4,"Yes, okay. But the thing was five
"
,,
7,4,"minutes past the throw out time.
"
,,
7,4,"Well, be that as it may. Shiwanda
"
,,
7,4,"took these pictures on her cellphone.
"
,,
7,4,"You're fired.
"
,,
7,4,"We're broke, Rupert.
"
,,
7,4,"I'm jobless, there's no food left
"
,,
7,4,"I'm out of diapers and
"
,,
7,4,"I'm down to Meg's last hat.
"
,,
7,4,"We're doomed, you know.
"
,,
7,4,"Let it be written on my tombstone
"
,,
7,4,"That my life was considerably
"
,,
7,4,"better with my family around.
"
,,
7,4,"And I didn't realize
"
,,
7,4,"it until it was too late.
"
,,
7,4,"Mommy! Daddy!
"
,,
7,4,"Chris! Dog! Brian!
"
,,
7,4,"They're home!
"
,,
7,4,"Oh, mommy, thank God you're home!
"
,,
7,4,"Ah, Stewie, my baby!
"
,,
7,4,"I promise with all my heart
"
,,
7,4,"that I'll never say or do
"
,,
7,4,"anything bad to you for
"
,,
7,4,"the rest of the evening.
"
,,
7,4,"By the way, I disabled the V-chip
"
,,
7,4,"and I've watched so much porn.
"
,,
7,4,"Ah, sweetie,
"
,,
7,4,"I'm so glad you're all right.
"
,,
7,4,"Yeah, no thanks
"
,,
7,4,"to Cleveland and Quagmire.
"

7,4,"Wonder what the hell happened to them.

"
,,
7,5,"Hey. You know what. We should try some of that stuff. Here, at home.
"
,,
7,5,"I don't know Peter. That scull and crossbones warning before show us pretty clear about not doing that.
"
,,
7,5,"Cleveland, shut up. I saw something on TV that I want to imitate.
"
,,
7,5,"Peter, what are you-- What are you boys doing up there? Get off the roof!
"
,,
7,5,"Go back in the house, Lois. We're being Jackass.
"
,,
7,5," Okay, ready?

7,5,"Oh my god! Are you okay?
"
,,
7,5,"I don't know. I don't know. What is it look like?
"
,,
7,5,"Wha-- What do I do? Aw. Ah, ah, what is that?
"
,,
7,5,"What is that? I feel something.
"
,,
7,5,"It's your spine, dude. It got like you ate down a bunch of nachos.
"
,,
7,5,"I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm scared. I'm sca--
"
,,
7,5,"Oh god!
"
,,
7,5,"This is get fixed with ice or heat?
"
,,
7,5,"Ice now, heat later.
"
,,
7,5,"I'm Glenn Quagmire and this is bee-bush.
"
,,
7,5,"All right, what did you do to yourself, Quagmire?
"
,,
7,5,"Well, I just covered my entire private area with honey.
"
,,
7,5,"Now we're just waiting for the bees. Giggity.
"
,,
7,5,"All right, here they come.
"
,,
7,5,"Heh. Okay. Okay, they're on there. Just-- just nobody move.
"
,,
7,5,"All right, nobody-- nobody do nothing, don't wanna-- don't wanna make 'em mad.
"
,,
7,5,"Stop it! Knock it off!
"
,,
7,5,"Yeah, we wouldn't want the bees to get mad.
"
,,
7,5,"I hate you bees.
"
,,
7,5,"Oh, stop! Stop! Knock it off! Knock it off!
"
,,
7,5,"I'm serious, stop! Stop! Stop! Just stop!
"
,,
7,5,"All right, that's enough! That's enough. Just-- get them off.
"
,,
7,5,"Get them off. Put them back in the hive.
"
,,
7,5,"Yeah, all right, enough is enough. Cleveland, open the hive.
"
,,
7,5,"All right, Quagmire, bring them over here.
"
,,
7,5,"Oh my!
"
,,
7,5,"Argh! What the fuck?!
"
,,
7,5,"Why would you do that?
"
,,
7,5,"Hey, you guys, Lois says it's time for dinner.
"
,,
7,5,"Peter, this is not safe at all.
"
,,
7,5,"Shut up, Brian. Just keep filming. Okay.
"
,,
7,5,"I'm Peter Griffin and I am the Greatest American Hero.
"
,,
7,5,"My special power is being somehow memorable after a very short run on TV.

"

"
,,
7,5," Get some, Peter!
"
,,
7,5," Nice job at that ramp, Joe.
"
,,
7,5,"There's one thing I know. It's ramps.
"
,,
7,5,"Wait a minute guys, I think he's really hurt.
"
,,
7,5,"Help! Help, I think my arm is broken.
"
,,
7,5,"Aw! My back! I can't move.
"
,,
7,5,"I though-- I was gonna die.
"
,,
7,5,"You know, Peter, I'd expect this kind of behaviour from you
"
,,
7,5,"but you have no business endangering Brian like that.
"
,,
7,5,"Thank you, Lois.
"
,,
7,5,"I mean he jumped into that lake to try to save your life and he's 8 years old, Peter.
"
,,
7,5,"Okay, Lois.
"
,,
7,5,"Why do you think he almost drowned?
"
,,
7,5,"He's old, Peter. Plus he drinks and smokes all the time
"
,,
7,5,"so take that 56 and make it 79 at least.
"
,,
7,5,"Why you making such a big deal out of this, Lois? I was just a little tired.
"
,,
7,5,"Yeah, well that's how it begins, Brian. Then the next thing you know
"
,,
7,5,"I'm making Peter dig a hole in the yard and you're in the pillowcase.
"
,,
7,5,"Peter, what's wrong? You've been so quiet all day.
"
,,
7,5,"Ah, it's just what you said the other day, Lois.
"
,,
7,5,"I'm starting to think you might be right.
"
,,
7,5,"Brian's getting old.
"
,,
7,5,"He's not the dog he used to be and-- I'll have to get used to it.
"
,,
7,5,"Just like I've got to used to my acrylic nails.
"
,,
7,5,"Stainian wine, Stock and Riceman.
"
,,
7,5,"Hey, Loranda.
"
,,
7,5,"No, I've got 4 people on hold but I can talk.
"
,,
7,5,"Good morning, everybody. Brian, I have something to say.
"
,,
7,5,"I'm sorry I've been so preoccupied with your age.
"
,,
7,5,"Well-- Look, Peter-- Don't worry, just let's forget about it.
"
,,
7,5,"Fantastic. And to help us forget about it
"
,,
7,5,"family, I'd like to introduce-- New Brian.
"
,,
7,5,"Hey, gang! Whose leg do you have to hump to get a hug around here?
"
,,
7,5,"Oh, I like him.
"
,,
7,5," You got a new dog?
"
,,
7,5," Yes, sir!
"
,,
7,5,"But-- I'm the dog.
"
,,
7,5,"Well, now you getting old and New Brian's here to take some of the load off.
"
,,
7,5," Can he do tricks?
"
,,
7,5," Oh, you bet!
"
,,
7,5,"He's trained to fetch, roll over, and make you feel realy good about yourself.
"
,,
7,5,"Well, Meg and Chris, I can't decide which one of your hats I like better.
"
,,
7,5,"I-- I can't believe you've got a new dog. What about me?
"
,,
7,5,"Hey, you still my buddy. New Brian is just a new friend for the family.
"
,,
7,5,"Trust me, you guys are gonna get along better that Abraham Lincoln and his neighbour.
"
,,
7,5,"Hey, Dale. I've noticed lawn's getting a little high.
"
,,
7,5,"Yeah, I used to have a guy for that.
"
,,
7,5,"Dick!
"
,,
7,5,"Okay now, you have a good one.
"
,,
7,5,"My word, what a gorgeous way to wake up.
"
,,
7,5,"I hope you don't mind. I checked the time your alarm was set for and I shut it off.
"
,,
7,5,"I figured this might be a more gentle way to start off the day.
"
,,
7,5,"Ah, that is so thoughtful, New Brian.
"
,,
7,5,"I'll start up again in 9 minutes.
"
,,
7,5,"Hey, Meg. I know how you like to let off steam once in a while, so I've got you a journal.
"
,,
7,5,"You got me a journal?
"
,,
7,5,"Actually, I got you two of them: my right ear and my left ear. Fire it away.
"
,,
7,5,"Dear diary. Today at the school library I saw a picture in National Geographic of a woman
"
,,
7,5,"with nipples that cover most of her breast too.
"
,,
7,5,"And suddenly I didn't feel so alone.
"
,,
7,5,"You know what it sounds like to me?
"
,,
7,5,"Sounds like the woman on that picture was pretty beautiful.
"
,,
7,5,"All right, I'll see you at dinner. Take fast.
"
,,
7,5,"Wow! Deodorant! Are you sure, I'm old enough?
"
,,
7,5,"Oh, I think so. I'm gonna make you a little less gross every day.
"
,,
7,5,"Hey, New Brian. Ah, you have a guitar.
"
,,
7,5,"Yep. In fact I wrote a new song today and I want to hear what you think of it.
"
,,
7,5,"Where did you find the time for that?
"
,,
7,5,"Peter, inspiration doesn't have a schedule.
"
,,
7,5,"[sings]

"

"
,,
7,5,"Hey, Brian. I went out for a run this morning and I found this sitck.
"
,,
7,5,"I thought you might like it.
"
,,
7,5,"Wow. Thanks a lot.
"
,,
7,5,"And I've got you some of this. I don't smoke it myself but I sure won't judge you.
"
,,
7,5,"Gosh! Thanks!
"
,,
7,5,"Check you later, handsome guy.
"
,,
7,5,"Well, you know, I wasn't sure about this new dog thing at first
"
,,
7,5,"but I've gotta tell you, he's a really terrific guy.
"
,,
7,5,"You poor damn fool.
"
,,
7,5," What?
"
,,
7,5," You have no idea what's going on here.
"
,,
7,5,"He's not just a delightful new friend for the family.
"
,,
7,5,"He's your replacement!
"
,,
7,5,"Oh, come on, that's ridiculous.
"
,,
7,5,"You're getting old, Brian, and they know it.
"
,,
7,5,"You no longer the cover girl. Look at Carol Alt.
"
,,
7,5,"Tha-- That's-- You're Carol Alt.
"
,,
7,5,"So? I'm through listening to you.
"
,,
7,5,"Fine. Think what you want, aging supermodel Carol Alt.
"
,,
7,5,"Carol, come in here. They saying your name on the Family Man.
"
,,
7,5," What?
"
,,
7,5," Huh?
"
,,
7,5," What?
"
,,
7,5," Huh?
"
,,
7,5," What?
"
,,
7,5," I forget.
"
,,
7,5,"And besides, Brian, the evidence is all right in front of your nose.
"
,,
7,5,"That's hilarious, New Brian.
"
,,
7,5,"Now do your impression of Punky Brewster's father.
"
,,
7,5,"Punky!
"
,,
7,5,"Oh, Punky.
"
,,
7,5,"Oh, Punky.
"
,,
7,5,"You have a dog named Brandon.
"
,,
7,5,"Hey, I'm Carol Alt for Polygrip.
"
,,
7,5,"They did it again!
"
,,
7,5," Who?
"
,,
7,5," The Family Man.
"
,,
7,5," Is that the one with the fish?
"
,,
7,5," No, that's American Boy.
"
,,
7,5,"Okay, relax Brian, there's no way they'd replace you.
"
,,
7,5,"But it probably couldn't hurt to remind them how much they value you as a family member.
"
,,
7,5,"Okay, everybody, tonight I've got a real treat for you.
"
,,
7,5,"We've all see you compilation video, Brian.
"
,,
7,5,"Shatner singing Rocketman, drunk Orson Welles during that commercial
"
,,
7,5,"Silvester Stallone in that porno, and Bill Cosby beating up that midget.
"
,,
7,5,"Well, I don't remember that last one.
"
,,
7,5,"Oh yes, freakin' brutal, for no reason.
"
,,
7,5,"You know, poor little guy just sitten there eating a snack pack
"
,,
7,5,"Bill Cosby just runs in out of nowhere and just starts wailing on him.
"
,,
7,5,"Didn't that guy died?
"
,,
7,5,"No, no, these are home movies from when I was a puppy.
"
,,
7,5," He died.
"
,,
7,5," Okay, look, just watch.
"
,,
7,5,"[Keep off the grass]
"
,,
7,5,"Ah, look at him sleep.
"
,,
7,5,"Oh, I wander what he's dreaming about.
"
,,
7,5,"Shut up, Meg.
"
,,
7,5," Did you hear that?
"
,,
7,5," He farted.
"
,,
7,5,"Just like in the song.
"
,,
7,5,"Argh, what the hell is the matter with you? Outside, outside, now!
"
,,
7,5,"Well, I hate to say ""I told you so"" but--
"
,,
7,5,"Wait a minute, I love saying ""I told you so"".
"
,,
7,5,"Doi! Hey, Stewie Griffin, meet Stewie Griffin.
"
,,
7,5,"Nice to meet you. Charmed, I'm sure.
"
,,
7,5,"Great outfit. Oh, go on. No, it is.
"
,,
7,5,"So what if they have a new dog? Lots of families have two dogs.
"
,,
7,5,"Hey, Brian, I thought maybe we could spend an afternoon together?
"
,,
7,5,"Really? That'd be great!
"
,,
7,5,"Awsome! 'Cause I've got this new gun.
"
,,
7,5,"Here we go.
"
,,
7,5,"And I thought we could go deep in the woods.
"
,,
7,5,"Where noone would ever think to look.
"
,,
7,5,"Oh, boy!
"
,,
7,5,"And a-- just shoot it.
"
,,
7,5,"Awkward.
"
,,
7,5,"You know, like so far in noone can hear a gunfire.
"
,,
7,5,"Little on the nose.
"
,,
7,5,"Or screaming.
"
,,
7,5,"Uh, I don't think so, Peter.
"
,,
7,5,"Jesus, looks like he thinks I'm gonna shoot him.

"
,,
7,5," Hello.
"
,,
7,5," Hey, wha-- what are-- what are you doing?
"
,,
7,5," Quagmire, I'm sleeping.
"
,,
7,5," Yeah, I was just out with Joe. Wha-- what are-- what are you doing?
"
,,
7,5," I just told you.
"
,,
7,5," Aw, that's right, I just-- I just asked that. I forgot.
"
,,
7,5,"Hey, hey, this song made me think of you, so wa-- listen to this song.
"
,,
7,5,"-awesome?
"
,,
7,5,"It's not him, you big bully.
"
,,
7,5,"Joe-- Joe told me not to call you.
"
,,
7,5," So w-- so wha-- so what's you doing?
"
,,
7,5," Sigh.
"
,,
7,5,"Everyone, I have an announcement to make.
"
,,
7,5,"I've decided, I'm leaving.
"
,,
7,5,"What? Leaving? Brian, why?
"
,,
7,5,"Well, you know, I feel like I've sort of-- ran my course here and
"
,,
7,5,"you know, besides there's whole big world out there and it's time I saw it.
"
,,
7,5,"But-- Brian, you live here, this is your home.
"
,,
7,5,"I know but I thought about this long and hard and--
"
,,
7,5,"Long and hard.
"
,,
7,5,"I am sorry, Brian, please, please, continue.
"
,,
7,5,"This is just something I have to do.
"
,,
7,5,"Well, where will you go?
"
,,
7,5,"Well, I haven't decided that yet but I promise I'll be in touch.
"
,,
7,5,"Wait, how is that one dirty?
"
,,
7,5,"It's-- I was remembering long and hard.
"
,,
7,5,"Well, if your mind is made up about this, Brian, then I wish you the best of luck.
"
,,
7,5,"I hope this move won't be a boner for you.
"
,,
7,5," Peter?
"
,,
7,5," Huh?
"
,,
7,5," What?
"
,,
7,5," I was just saying to Brian, I hope this move won't be a boner.
"
,,
7,5,"I-- I would agree. I hope he finds what he's looking for.
"
,,
7,5,"Okay-- Well-- We gonna miss you, Brian.
"
,,
7,5," Pancake?
"
,,
7,5," Just a small one, thanks.
"
,,
7,5,"My god, these are the best pancakes I've ever had.
"
,,
7,5,"I bet Brian would love these pancakes.
"
,,
7,5,"I wander where he is.
"
,,
7,5,"He's next door with Cleveland.
"
,,
7,5,"I saw him on my morning paper route.
"
,,
7,5,"You know, I appreciate you letting me stay with you but
"
,,
7,5,"I'm perfectly capable of going into the bathroom by myself.
"
,,
7,5,"Sorry, but there's leash in this neighbourhood and you never know who's watching.
"
,,
7,5,"I'm watching you make stool.
"
,,
7,5,"Hey, New Brian. Oh, I see you're having pie.
"
,,
7,5,"You know, pie isn't really pie without coolwhip.
"
,,
7,5,"Everything's better with coolwhip.
"
,,
7,5," Did you heared what I said?
"
,,
7,5," Yeah, what about it?
"
,,
7,5,"It doesn't bother you the way I pronounce it?
"
,,
7,5," Coolwhip.
"
,,
7,5," No, why would it?
"
,,
7,5,"Coolwhip. I'm putting emphasys on the H.
"
,,
7,5,"Sounds right to me.
"
,,
7,5,"Nothing ever bothers you, does it?
"
,,
7,5,"No, not really, I like everything.
"
,,
7,5,"God, he's bigger buzz kill than Buzz Killington.
"
,,
7,5,"Stewie. Do you know why W.S. Gilbert was frequently drunk on his transatlantic crossings?
"
,,
7,5,"No.
"
,,
7,5,"Because he was quartered on the port side.
"
,,
7,5,"Now that I've got you, let's both revisit the birth of the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company.

"
,,
7,5,"Okay, New Brian, you're next.
"
,,
7,5,"Oh no, oh boy, all right.
"
,,
7,5,"Well, I can't do this alone. Lois, I'm gonna need your help here.
"
,,
7,5,"Okay, Rita Coolidge's less talented sister here.
"
,,
7,5,"I what way is that a joke?
"
,,
7,5,"Okay, then you start.
"
,,
7,5,"I-- I don't know-- Am I blue or am I red?
"
,,
7,5,"You're blue, you're blue.
"

"

7,5,"Thanks for letting me stay, Glenn. I hope I'm not in the way.
"
,,
7,5,"No, no, should be fine. But-- listen, Brian.
"
,,
7,5,"I'm gonna be bringing a puerto-rican girl over here later
"
,,
7,5,"and she's superhot and real nice but
"
,,
7,5,"when she was five years old her dad ran over one of her legs with his van
"
,,
7,5,"and it's still kinda messed up in a pretty obvious instantly visible way and uh--
"
,,
7,5,"please don't say anything and--
"
,,
7,5,"try to make eye contact with her when she waddles in because I want this to work.
"
,,
7,5,"Uh-- Yeah. Sure. No problem.
"
,,
7,5,"I'm serious, Brian, that leg is a trainwreck.
"
,,
7,5,"I mean she herself is so pretty but--
"
,,
7,5,"that thing just looks like a string of sausages with one empty casing in 'em.
"
,,
7,5," I get it.
"
,,
7,5," I mean it's quite a sight.
"
,,
7,5,"You know, when she's not looking you should take a look at it but
"
,,
7,5,"but, good god, be discreet.
"
,,
7,5,"Yeah, I'll uh-- I'll check that out.
"
,,
7,5,"Stewie, what are you doing here?
"
,,
7,5,"Brian, you've gotta come back.
"
,,
7,5," Why?
"
,,
7,5," Because.
"
,,
7,5,"New Brian is such a tool.
"
,,
7,5,"I mean he's-- he's so damn sweet and saccharine and
"
,,
7,5,"perfect and he's turnin the family in to the bunch of douches.
"
,,
7,5,"No big deal, you've always told me I was a douche.
"
,,
7,5,"Yeah. But you were my douche, Brian. My douche.
"
,,
7,5,"Come back and be my douche again.
"
,,
7,5,"Hi. I'm looking for Glenn.
"
,,
7,5,"Argh! What happened to your leg?
"
,,
7,5,"Damn it, Brian.
"
,,
7,5,"Come back home, Brian.
"
,,
7,5,"I tell you what, when this is all over, I'll make you some pie with a nice dollop of coolwhip.
"
,,
7,5,"There it is again, why you putting so much emphasys on the H?
"
,,
7,5,"That's exactly why I miss you, Brian.
"
,,
7,5,"Forget it, I'm going back as long as that new dog is there.
"
,,
7,5,"As long as he's a part of that family there's no place for me.
"
,,
7,5,"Can't say I blame you, I hate him as much as you do, Brian.
"
,,
7,5,"He's a bad fit. Like a crocodile at the alligator rally.
"
,,
7,5,"Yeah, lurking in the water with our eyes poken out.
"
,,
7,5,"Yeah!!!
"
,,
7,5,"Sneaking up on a crane or an egret and snapping our jaws on it.
"
,,
7,5,"Yeah!!!
"
,,
7,5,"And sometimes walking out on to a dry plane
"
,,
7,5,"or dusty field because it's nice to get out of the swamp now and then.
"
,,
7,5,"Yeah!!! Wa-- Wait. What?
"
,,
7,5,"Dry plane. Dusty field.
"
,,
7,5,"Nice to get out of the swamp.
"
,,
7,5,"What a crock!
"
,,
7,5,"And that's where we get the term.
"
,,
7,5,"Hey, New Brian, bad news. You got to leave.
"
,,
7,5,"Huh? What are you talking about? This is my home.
"
,,
7,5,"Nobody likes you here, man.
"
,,
7,5,"Well, I disagree, I think everybody likes me.
"
,,
7,5,"No, we don't. We don't like your cooking, your stupid karaoke nights,
"
,,
7,5,"and we especially don't like the way you humped that chair in the den.
"
,,
7,5,"Well, Rupert seems to like my humping.
"
,,
7,5,"What did you said?
"
,,
7,5,"Rupert. Humped him for two hours yesterday.
"
,,
7,5,"He just laid there and took it.
"
,,
7,5," Did he?
"
,,
7,5," Yeah!
"
,,
7,5,"And now every time you sleeping with him, he's gonna be thinking of me.
"
,,
7,5,"And that is why I killed myself
"
,,
7,5,"chopped myself up and put myself in the garbage.
"
,,
7,5,"Well, he must have had some demons.
"
,,
7,5,"Oh my god, suicide. How could we misjudge him so severly.
"
,,
7,5,"Often times it's the one who seem a happiest.
"
,,
7,5,"Well, the upside is at least we have our Old Brian back.
"
,,
7,5,"From now on, buddy, you're the only animal I care about.
"
,,
7,5,"Hey, everybody, I'm Bernie the hamster.
"
,,
7,5,"Would you like to be my friend?
"
,,
7,5,"Aaaah, oh my god--
"
,,
7,5,"It's okay, Peter.
"
,,
7,5,"Yeah, oh my god, oh my god, it's hamster--
"
,,
7,5,"We'll talk about it,
"
,,
7,5,"when you want to talk about it.

"
,,
7,6,"Well, that sounds hilarious but it also sounds like it might take a while.
"
,,
7,6,"I'm afraid that's your only option.
"
,,
7,6,"Well, I mean, if that's what I got to do, then I guess I--
"
,,

7,7,"Oh, Brian, come here.
"
,,
7,7,"Would you mind listen to this song I wrote for Susie Swanson and tell me what you think?
"
,,
7,7,"Ok.
"
,,
7,7,"That's... that's all I have so far.
"
,,
7,7,"That was horrible. It was bad as Beethoven near the end.
"
,,
7,7,"They gonna love that.
"
,,
7,7,"Well, I'm still gonna do a little work on it.
"
,,
7,7,"What's it called?
"
,,
7,7,"Susie.
"
,,
7,7,"Wow! A song named after a girl.
"
,,
7,7,"There're million of those already.

"
,,
7,7,"Go fuck yourself.
"
,,
7,7,"What am I gonna do, guys? I paid the hospital bill
"
,,
7,7,"but now I need $20k to pay the lawn shark.
"
,,
7,7,"I'm right back where I started.
"
,,
7,7,"Well, sounds like we need another lawn shark.
"
,,
7,7,"Don't worry, Joe. We're all gonna pitch in and help you raise that money.
"
,,
7,7,"Wow Peter, I got to say
"
,,
7,7,"this lemonade stand was really a good idea. It's selling really well.
"
,,
7,7,"That's because it has my secret ingridient in it.
"
,,
7,7,"Vodka!
"
,,
7,7,"You know what we should do?
"
,,
7,7,"You know what we should do?
"
,,
7,7,"We should just... We should just get on our bikes and just go.
"
,,
7,7,"Just go and start a business.
"
,,
7,7,"You know... I've never to... I've never told anyone this.
"
,,
7,7,"but you're so good at cursive.
"
,,
7,7,"I don't know Peter, we've been out here all day
"
,,
7,7,"and we haven't managed to interest a single woman in our massage parlour.
"
,,
7,7,"Wait a minute, here comes somebody.
"
,,
7,7,"Excuse me, stressed out lady.
"
,,
7,7,"May I interest you in a full release relaxation massage?
"
,,
7,7,"Oh yeah! Just what I need. To be rubbed down by big fatty
"
,,
7,7,"an old black guy, a crippled and a pervert.
"
,,
7,7,"Now we don't have any money and our feelings are hurt.
"
,,
7,7,"So, that's pretty much it, mr. Pewterschmidt
"
,,
7,7,"Joe's getting desperate and we haven't raised nearly enough.
"
,,
7,7,"Is there any way you could help us out?
"
,,
7,7,"Of course I could.
"
,,
7,7,"But it's funnier to me if I don't.
"
,,
7,7,"In about an hour I'm gonna piss away 20 grand.
"
,,
7,7,"What are you gonna bet on the Nicks?
"
,,
7,7,"It's... I'm sorry... I mean how often...
"
,,
7,7,"I mean... Oh, man, nobody think that's funny?
"
,,
7,7,"Oh my god, she's so hot.
"
,,
7,7,"Look at that, she can fit that full bottle in her mouth.
"
,,
7,7,"Allright, come on Stewie, you can write a song. How hard could it be.
"
,,
7,7,"You sound like an unbelieveable douche.
"
,,
7,7,"Music and lyrics by Stewie Griffin.
"
,,
7,7,"Hey Swanson, the boss is getting impatient. He wants his money.
"
,,
7,7,"He says after we've done with you, you gonna be eaten...
"
,,
7,7,"Swanson TV... TV-di... wait, what did he said?
"
,,
7,7," What?
"
,,
7,7," Wha-What did the boss said? He said something funny and now I drowe the blank, wha-wha-what it was?
"
,,
7,7,"Eh, you know what is was? You know what it was?
"
,,
7,7,"When we're done with him he's gonna be a Swanson TV-dinner.
"
,,
7,7,"That is pretty funny.
"
,,
7,7,"Look what they did to me. My legs are useless now.
"
,,
7,7,"And trust me, they'll be back.
"
,,
7,7,"Well, what are we gonna do?
"
,,
7,7,"You know what, boys? Desperate times call for desperate measures.
"
,,
7,7,"If that stingy old cat won't give us the money we need
"
,,
7,7,"I say we take it from him.
"
,,
7,7,"Guys, we are gonna plan a robbery.
"
,,
7,7,"Hey, hey. That's the guy.
"
,,
7,7,"That's the guy whose chin... looks like a b... balls.
"
,,
7,7,"All right. On a normal night in a Pewterschmidt mansion there might be as much as 6 million dollars in a vault alone.
"
,,
7,7,"But this Saturday is the Pewterschmidt annual ""Bring all your cash and put it in our safe"" party.
"
,,
7,7,"Considering the guest list there could be as much as 40 million.
"
,,
7,7,"But we only need 20 thousand.
"
,,
7,7,"All right, I'll be honest with you.
"
,,
7,7,"My father-in-law has treated me like crap
"
,,
7,7,"for almost 20 years and it's time for a little payback.
"
,,
7,7,"I tell you, he's treated me worse than that jerk Cristian Bale did.
"
,,
7,7,"I want you off the fucking set, you prick!
"
,,
7,7,"Sorry.
"
,,
7,7,"Don't just be sorry!
"
,,
7,7,"Think for one fucking second!
"
,,
7,7,"I dropped the pean(?) on Eminem and rolled over here.
"
,,
7,7,"I'm not gonna walk around and rip your fucking lights stand in a middle of a scene.
"
,,
7,7,"Those are the Christmas lights, I put them up to make everyone happy.
"
,,
7,7,"Then why the fuck are walking right through?
"
,,
7,7,"Ah, ta-da-ta-da, like this in the back room. What the fuck it is with you?
"
,,
7,7,"Well, you are gonna owe a fortune to a swearjack(?).
"
,,
7,7,"You got ... here. Hey, it's fucking distracting!
"
,,
7,7,"Having somebody walking up behind bries(?) in the scene.
"
,,
7,7,"Give me your fucking answer!
"
,,
7,7,"I don't get it.
"
,,
7,7,"What don't you get about it?
"
,,
7,7,"I don't get why we need another terminator. I just... I don't get it.
"
,,
7,7,"And by the way, sorry, I ate that last piece of pie you were saving for yourself.
"
,,
7,7,"Ah! Good for you! And how was it?
"
,,
7,7,"It was good.
"
,,
7,7,"I hope it was fucking good because it's useless now, isn't it?
"
,,
7,7,"Wa... It's nourishing me, so it's useful.
"
,,
7,7,"... sake man, you're amateur.
"
,,
7,7,"I don't know that word.
"
,,
7,7,"Stay off the fucking set man.
"
,,
7,7,"Right, let's go again.
"
,,
7,7,"Can we just take a minute?
"
,,
7,7,"Let's not take a fucking minute, let's go again!
"
,,
7,7,"I'm gonna go pee and I wanna walk around
"
,,
7,7,"some more and I walla scenes going (?).
"
,,
7,7,"You're unbelieveable, man.
"
,,
7,7,"I just don't understand...
"
,,
7,7,"You don't fucking understand what it's like working with actors. That's what that is.
"
,,
7,7,"I... I don't think that's what that...
"
,,
7,7,"That's what that is, man, I'm telling you.
"
,,
7,7,"My family is coming to town, do you mind pretending that I'm the director.
"
,,
7,7,"(?)
"
,,
7,7,"Oh, there's my laptop.
"
,,
7,7,"Do you mind, I wanna check my e-mail.
"
,,
7,7,"Go away! I'm editing this music video, I'm making for Susie.
"
,,
7,7,"Oh, really? Music video?
"
,,
7,7,"Working on a little video there?
"
,,
7,7,"Little uh... Little music video?
"
,,
7,7,"Little compilation of visual images to go with the song?
"
,,
7,7,"Little 4-minute movie that tells the story of...
"
,,
7,7,"Yeah, that only works when I do it.
"
,,
7,7,"There. All done. All right, Brian, get ready to feel.
"
,,
7,7," I'm not following the story arc here.
"
,,
7,7," Shut up!
"
,,
7,7,"Don't worry, Brian, those goose bumps will go away in about 20 minutes.
"
,,
7,7,"Bill, how are you? Barb, come over here and say hi to Bill Gates.
"
,,
7,7,"Hello, mr. Gates.
"
,,
7,7,"Hi, mrs. Pewterschmidt. Well, this is a great little party you guys are throwing.
"
,,
7,7,"Hey Bill, will you help me programming my Zune?
"
,,
7,7,"Oh, wait, I have an iPod like the rest of the world.
"
,,
7,7,"Why you?
"
,,
7,7,"All right, Joe, we're here.
"
,,
7,7,"All right, Peter, Quagmire, start the diversion.
"
,,
7,7,"Cleveland, find that door.
"
,,
7,7," Check.
"
,,
7,7," Check.
"
,,
7,7,"Hey fellas, knock off all that high society crap and play some of this.
"
,,
7,7,"One. Two. Three. Four.
"
,,
7,7,"All right, Cleveland, you're all clear to enter the vault.
"
,,
7,7,"Copy that.
"
,,
7,7,"Uh oh, it's a combination lock.
"
,,
7,7,"Looks like I'm just gonna cut through it.
"
,,
7,7,"Good thing I brought Reese Witherspoon's cheen.
"
,,
7,7,"Brian, do you know where Peter is?
"
,,
7,7,"Yeah, he and the guys went to rob your dad.
"
,,
7,7,"I believe you.
"
,,
7,7,"I'm in.
"
,,
7,7,"Holy crap, there's another door.
"
,,
7,7,"What are we gonna do?
"
,,
7,7,"Welcome to the vault. Voice identification, please.
"
,,
7,7,"Uh oh.
"
,,
7,7,"It's me, Carter, I want my money.
"
,,
7,7,"Voice print verified.
"
,,
7,7,"How the hell did you do that?
"
,,
7,7,"I can do you guys too.
"
,,
7,7," Hey everybody.
"
,,
7,7," Oh, hey Peter.
"
,,
7,7," No, it's still me.
"
,,
7,7," Ah.
"
,,
7,7,"Welcome to the inner vault. Penile identification required.
"
,,
7,7,"Let me handle this.
"
,,
7,7,"That's amazing! How the hell did you match it?
"
,,
7,7,"Oh, I didn't match the shape, I just stuck in and broke it.
"
,,
7,7,"Final checkpoint. Answer this question.
"
,,
7,7,"What is the most unattractive male first name in the English language?
"
,,
7,7,"Kif.
"
,,
7,7,"Wow! Look at this place.
"
,,
7,7,"All right boys, pack up the do(?) and get out of there.
"
,,
7,7,"Joe, stop!
"
,,
7,7,"Lois, what are you doing here?
"
,,
7,7,"I'm here to try to talk some sense into you.
"
,,
7,7,"Do you really wanna go through with this?
"
,,
7,7,"I have to, Lois, for my family.
"
,,
7,7,"I don't know where else to get 20 thousand dollars.
"
,,
7,7,"But you know, dad will find out
"
,,
7,7,"he'll put his best people on a job and believe me he'll catch you.
"
,,
7,7,"That's the risk I'm willing to take.
"
,,
7,7,"But think about your beautiful little girl.
"
,,
7,7,"You can't wach her grow up from jail.
"
,,
7,7,"You'll miss running after her as she learns to walk...
"
,,
7,7,"I... I mean... I mean riding bikes with her as she...
"
,,
7,7,"I mean dancing at the wedding...
"
,,
7,7,"Look, my point is you know that you doing this wrong
"
,,
7,7,"and you know how to make it right.
"
,,
7,7,"Uh... Guys... Put the money back and get out of there.
"
,,
7,7,"What? Are you out of your mind?
"
,,
7,7,"Tell 'em, Megatron.
"
,,
7,7,"DO AS I COMMAND!
"
,,
7,7,"Ok, ok, jeez.
"
,,
7,7,"So, how'd Susie like your video?
"
,,
7,7,"I don't care about her anymore.
"
,,
7,7,"I'm in love with Brian Adams.
"
,,
7,7,"Peter, I want you to promise me, you'll never do anything that stupid again.
"
,,
7,7,"Lois, after what you did for Joe, I promise you everything.
"
,,
7,7,"How the hell did you get your dad to give that 20 grand?
"
,,
7,7,"I told him it was for me.
"
,,
7,7,"I said I wanted to hire a divorce lawyer.
"
,,
7,7,"You're... you joking about that, right?
"
,,
7,7,"Lois?

7,8,"Now remember, Peter, don't touch these money until you get to the grocery store.
"
,,
7,8,"Then buy one can of beans and come straight home.
"
,,
7,8,"Do you understand?
"
,,
7,8,"Lois, I'm the guy you can trust with the task.

"

7,8,"You left for the market six hours ago. Did you get the beans?
"
,,
7,8,"Lois, I've got something better!
"
,,
7,8,"You know how you always wanted a real diamond engagement ring?
"
,,
7,8,"Oh! Oh my god!
"
,,
7,8,"That's right! I bought a horse.
"
,,
7,8,"You bought a horse?
"
,,
7,8,"Why the h... I didn't even give you that much money.
"
,,
7,8,"That's what I thought, Lois.
"
,,
7,8,"Sold! To the gentleman from Quahog, Rhode Island.
"
,,
7,8,"Congratulations, sir! What brings you down to Louisville?
"
,,
7,8,"I don't know!
"
,,
7,8,"Peter, there's something off about that horse.
"
,,
7,8,"You have an eye for animals, Lois.
"
,,
7,8,"This horse is brain-damaged, that's why I got it so cheap.
"
,,
7,8,"Peter, I don't think it's wise to have a brain-damaged horse as a house pet.
"
,,
7,8,"Shut up!
"
,,
7,8,"You don't know nothing.
"
,,
7,8,"But anything.
"
,,
7,8,"Whatever Peter. Fine. Keep the horse.
"
,,
7,8,"Good. This family works much better when we're unified.
"
,,
7,8,"You'll see, this horse will be a fine addition to our family.
"
,,
7,8,"You know what, I don't want him to feel selfconcious. Everybody pee.
"
,,
7,8," Pee no...
"
,,
7,8," Everybody pee.
"
,,
7,8,"NOW
"
,,
7,8,"We're an unusual family.
"
,,
7,8,"Peter. The horse is here.
"
,,
7,8,"Oh yeah.
"
,,
7,8,"It's so creepy the way it just stares like that.
"
,,
7,8,"Why isn't it do something?
"
,,
7,8,"Uh... What is it?
"
,,
7,8,"Brian... Is Paul Sorvino standing behind me?
"
,,
7,8,"Hey, you wanna sugar cube, horsy?

"

7,8,"Peter, take Maple Drive, otherwise we won't make the movie on time.
"
,,
7,8,"All right.
"
,,
7,8," Uh oh.
"
,,
7,8," What?
"
,,
7,8,"Uh... The horse is right behind the car.
"
,,
7,8,"Peter, this thing is just creepy.
"
,,
7,8,"Hey! Scare! Scare!
"
,,
7,8,"Cmon you! We're go... We're going to see a movie.
"
,,
7,8,"All right, I'm gonna try something else.
"
,,
7,8,"No, no, no, no, no, nooo...
"
,,
7,8,"Oh, that's got all my stink of the day in it.
"
,,
7,8,"That's nasty.
"
,,
7,8,"Peter, why are there so many bottles of milk in the refrigerator?
"
,,
7,8,"Oh, thanks for reminding me.
"
,,
7,8,"Everyone, some of the milk in the fridge is not milk
"
,,
7,8,"it's horse sperm.
"
,,
7,8,"I'm a horse breeder now.
"
,,
7,8,"Peter, no one's gonna want to breed with that horse.
"
,,
7,8,"After tomorrow they will.
"
,,
7,8,"I'm gonna enter him into the Quahog derby and he's gonna win.
"
,,
7,8,"I just know it. I got a sixth sense about these things.
"

7,8,"Remember when I predicted the ending to the wild hogs?
"
,,
7,8,"This movie is gonna suck.

,,
7,8,"I'm 48.
"

7,8,"This whole place is a giant mindfuck.
"
,,
7,8,"Boy, I've never been in the owners box.
"
,,
7,8,"We are gonna get a great view of the track from up here.
"
,,
7,8,"This is gonna be a great race.
"
,,
7,8,"What are you doing? Get down there.
"
,,
7,8,"Where's your midget?
"
,,
7,8,"Sorry boss, had to pee.
"
,,
7,8,"Come on, you.
"
,,
7,8,"Guess, he's got a small bladder.
"

7,8,"Little tiny guy, gotta go all the time.
"

7,8,"Even though he's got a race, he couldn't hold it.
"

7,8,"And they're off!
"
,,
7,8,"Go, horsy, go!

7,8,"God, it even runs like it messed up in the head.

7,8,"You named your horse 'Til Death?
"
,,
7,8,"You know why?
"
,,
7,8,"'Cause I'm gonna take this horse and shove it down America's throat.
"
,,
7,8,"What's this?
"
,,
7,8,"It looks like 'Till Death has taken a right turn and is heading into the stand.
"
,,
7,8,"Dear god! I could describe the horror I'm witnessing
"
,,
7,8,"but it is so unfathomable ugly and heartrending that I cannot bring myself to do so.
"

7,8,"Although I do posess the necessary descriptive powers.
"

7,8,"Oh... Well at least the horse ran past the class of visiting deaf secondgraders.

7,8,"Oh no! Dear god, it's going back.

7,8,"I know you can't hear any screams

7,8,"Look, can we not talk about the horse, please? It's gone.
"
,,
7,8,"It suffered a fatal heart attack from the exitement when I disposed of it properly.
"
,,
7,8,"Oh boy. I miss the old days when it was just a flaming bag of poop and a hurtful note.

7,8,"I have no idea how the hell we're gonna pay for this, Peter.

7,8,"This is perfect. Now I want to take off that job as Matt Damon's neck.
"
,,
7,8,"Hey, Matt.
"
,,
7,8,"Matt.
"
,,
7,8,"Hey, is this another one of those movies
"
,,
7,8,"where you're an educated Boston street tough?
"
,,
7,8,"I don't have to take that crap from you, neck.
"
,,
7,8,"Ah, you have to, my friend.
"
,,
7,8,"I'm your neck.
"
,,
7,8,"What're you gonna do? Chop me? You'll die.
"
,,
7,8,"You'll die if you do that.
"
,,
7,8,"Can somebody from wardrobe bring me a scarf?
"
,,
7,8,"Oh, I'm still gonna... I'll just talk louder.
"
,,
7,8,"Ben Affleck married Jennifer Gardner
"
,,
7,8,"but you're married a bartender with a kid.
"
,,
7,8,"These are facts.
"
,,
7,8,"So what have I got to do, doc?
"
,,
7,8,"You don't have to do anything mr. Griffin.
"
,,
7,8,"We're isolating and studying the effects of various types of genes.
"
,,
7,8,"We're just going to give you a series of experimental injections and record the results.
"
,,
7,8,"What's this one?
"
,,
7,8,"We call this the squirrel gene.
"
,,
7,8,"Its effects will become apparent shortly.
"
,,
7,8,"OK. What's next?
"
,,
7,8,"This is the Seth Rogen gene.
"
,,
7,8,"It will give you the appearance of being funny even though you haven't done anything funny.
"
,,
7,8,"Hey, doc, is it gonna be much longer?
"
,,
7,8,"I gotta get some beers with the fellas before I go on this date.
"
,,
7,8,"How charming and chubby. I'm routing (?) for you.
"
,,
7,8,"All right, mr. Griffin, at this time we're going to inject
"
,,
7,8,"you with what we believe we've isolatet as...
"
,,
7,8,"the Gay gene.
"
,,
7,8,"I don't understand.
"
,,
7,8,"Well, if we're correct, we'll have successfuly
"
,,
7,8,"proven that homosexuality is genetic.
"
,,
7,8,"And not the matter of choice or environment.
"
,,
7,8,"Are you crazy?
"
,,
7,8,"I don't wanna take a chance on being gay.
"
,,
7,8,"We'll give you a hundred and twenty five dollars.
"
,,
7,8,"All right, I'll do it.
"
,,
7,8,"Boy, you are more persuasive than James Bond.
"
,,
7,8,"Now. Time for some unfinished business.
"
,,
7,8," No, James.
"
,,
7,8," Yes!
"
,,
7,8," No, James!
"
,,
7,8," Yes! You're going to have sex with me.
"
,,
7,8,"No, James, I don't want to.
"
,,
7,8,"Yes, you do.
"
,,
7,8," No, I don't.
"
,,
7,8," Yes, you do!
"
,,
7,8," No, I don't!
"
,,
7,8," Yes, you do!
"
,,
7,8,"Okay, yes.
"
,,
7,8,"See that? 50 Nos and a yes means yes.
"
,,
7,8,"Hi.
"
,,
7,8,"So how the medical experiments go?
"
,,
7,8,"So good, Lois, so good.
"
,,
7,8,"I'm gonna squeeze right in here if my size will let me.
"
,,
7,8,"Peter, what exactly did they inject you with? 
"
,,
7,8,"Ah, all sorts of things
"
,,
7,8,"hepatitis vaccine, a couple of steroids
"
,,
7,8,"the gay gene, calcium, a vitamine b extract.
"
,,
7,8,"What did you just say?
"
,,
7,8,"The gay gene.
"
,,
7,8,"I assume that's the one you meant even though it wasn't literally the last
"
,,
7,8,"thing I've said when you said ""What did you just say?""
"
,,
7,8,"Clearly it was the most unusual.
"
,,
7,8,"Yes! That's the one I meant.
"
,,
7,8,"Peter... are you... gay?
"
,,
7,8,"Guil-tyyyyyy...
"
,,
7,8,"Did anybody see that absolutely fabulous piece on Fiji in yesterday's travel section?
"
,,
7,8,"I wish I was Beyonce.
"
,,
7,8,"Peter, I think maybe you should go back and have that doctor undo whatever he did.
"
,,
7,8,"Oh, my muffins are ready.
"
,,
7,8,"You made muffins?
"
,,
7,8,"Well, it wasn't the muffin fairy.
"
,,
7,8,"Or was it?
"
,,
7,8,"Go ahead, try it.
"
,,
7,8,"Peter...
"
,,
7,8,"Try it.
"
,,
7,8,"Dad, I think mom's right. Maybe you should go back to that doctor.
"
,,
7,8,"Well now. Wait a minute, Meg.
"
,,
7,8,"Let's not be too hasty. These are delicious.
"
,,
7,8,"What?
"
,,
7,8,"I've said homosexuality is wrong.
"
,,
7,8,"Are you... Are you being serious right now?
"
,,
7,8,"Just keep it in the bedroom, you know.
"
,,
7,8,"I mean, I'm not holding your face with my heterosexuality.
"
,,
7,8,"Uh... No, you are not.
"
,,
7,8,"Damn it!
"
,,
7,8,"Knock-knock.
"
,,
7,8,"What's the problem, champ?
"
,,
7,8,"Why is math so hard?
"
,,
7,8,"Way you know it doesn't have to be.
"
,,
7,8,"One trick I used to use is turn the things into a word problem.
"
,,
7,8,"For example
"
,,
7,8,"If there are three glory holes in the bathroom at the club and
"
,,
7,8,"How many rotations of guys will it take before everybody's had a turn?
"
,,
7,8,"I don't know.
"
,,
7,8,"Nine, with the remainder of Brent.
"
,,
7,8,"Oh...
"
,,
7,8,"Guys, Brent can't fit in the glory hole, and that's why we all like Brent.
"
,,
7,8,"We now return to
"
,,
7,8,"That black guy must be doing well because everything he owns is white.
"
,,
7,8,"Hey, how're you doing?
"
,,
7,8,"Wow! He must be doing well.
"
,,
7,8,"Well, here's the new nighty you've picked up for me.
"
,,
7,8,"What do you think?
"
,,
7,8,"I think I'm jelous of miss ""Eats anything she wants
"
,,
7,8,"and still fits into size 4"" Oh, I could scratch your eyes out. Meow.
"
,,
7,8,"You know, Peter, with all the shopping and cooking
"
,,
7,8,"and decorating. I have to say
"
,,
7,8,"I'm really liking the new you an awful lot.
"
,,
7,8,"An AWFUL lot.
"
,,
7,8,"Wha... What are you... What are you doing?
"
,,
7,8,"I'm fooling around.
"
,,
7,8,"C'mon, sweety, let's have some fun.
"
,,
7,8,"Lois! I'm gay!
"
,,
7,8,"You... Wait a minute, you mean...
"
,,
7,8,"We can't have sex?
"
,,
7,8,"Uh! Nooo!
"
,,
7,8,"Peter, we're married.
"
,,
7,8,"Tony Randall was married, Lois
"
,,
7,8,"Rock Hudson was married
"
,,
7,8,"Ronald Reagan was married.
"
,,
7,8,"Mr. President, did you reach a missile pact?
"
,,
7,8,"Well, you could say that.
"
,,
7,8,"There was a missile and something definitely got pact.
"
,,
7,8,"Just tell me, doctor, is there anything you can do to remove this gene?
"
,,
7,8,"Well, mrs. Griffin, it doesn't really work that way.
"
,,
7,8,"We just have to wait for the effects to wear off.
"
,,
7,8,"Well, how long will that take?
"
,,
7,8,"A week, a month, a year...
"
,,
7,8,"Oh! Rent! Rent! Rent!
"
,,
7,8,"For all we know, he could be this way for the rest of his life.
"
,,
7,8,"I don't see what's the big deal is. I like myself this way.
"
,,
7,8,"It's a very big deal. You'll be treated differently.
"
,,
7,8,"Just like my uncle Ray with the really high up anus.
"
,,
7,8,"I'll be out in a minute.
"
,,
7,8,"So, dad's gonna be gay forever?
"
,,
7,8,"Possibly, Meg.
"
,,
7,8,"So we're all just gonna have to get used to this
"
,,
7,8,"and lend to accept your father for who he is now.
"
,,
7,8,"Oh, great plan, Lois. Hey, here's a merry idea
"
,,
7,8,"ever read The Bible? Leviticus 18:22.
"
,,
7,8,"Stewie, you judgementaly quoting Bible versus and you don't even know how to read.
"
,,
7,8,"Welcome to America, Brian.
"
,,
7,8,"Hi, everybody. This is Scott.
"
,,
7,8,"Aw... Who's Scott?
"
,,
7,8,"My solemate, Lois. I'm here, I'm queer, but don't get used to it 'cause I'm leaving you.
"
,,
7,8,"What?!
"
,,
7,8,"I'm sorry, Lois. I can't deny who I am any longer.
"
,,
7,8,"I am Peter Griffin, homosexual.
"
,,
7,8,"And that's how I gonna live my life.
"
,,
7,8,"Chris, you're the man of the house now.
"
,,
7,8,"Take the lessons I've thought you and be the best leader of this household you can.
"
,,
7,8,"I will, dad!
"
,,
7,8,"Oh god, I miss Peter so much.
"
,,
7,8,"Gay or not, I just wish he was still here.
"
,,
7,8,"I miss dad too, mom. But we'll manage it somehow.
"
,,
7,8,"We're still a family, right?
"
,,
7,8,"Yeah! I mean we're thighter than asian family.
"
,,
7,8,"You doctor yet?
"
,,
7,8,"No, dad, I'm 12.
"
,,
7,8,"Talk to me when you're doctor.
"
,,
7,8,"I am so gay for you, Scott.
"
,,
7,8,"I'm so gay for you, Peter.
"
,,
7,8,"Penis for your thoughts.
"
,,
7,8,"I just... You complete me, you know that?
"
,,
7,8,"You just make me want to be a gayer man.
"
,,
7,8,"Oh, come here.
"
,,
7,8,"And you don't miss your wife at all?
"
,,
7,8,"Ah, sure I do, but this is a whole new chapter of my life, Scott.
"
,,
7,8,"And that chapter is all about you.
"
,,
7,8,"Oh, Peter, let's snuggle on the couch and watch Lifetime.
"
,,
7,8,"We now return to Meredith Baxter in
"
,,
7,8,"Raped by a Clown.
"
,,
7,8,"It was awful, he made me do things
"
,,
7,8,"awful things.
"
,,
7,8,"What kind of things?
"
,,
7,8,"I don't even talk about it.
"
,,
7,8,"So, you sure you don't need any house repairs, mrs. Griffin?
"
,,
7,8,"No, thanks, Rick. Ever since Peter left
"
,,
7,8,"our house hasn't been getting destroyed by a shenenigans on a weekly basis.
"
,,
7,8,"God, I feel so bad for Lois. She really misses Peter.
"
,,
7,8,"I just wish there were something we could do.
"
,,
7,8,"Well there is Brian. I looked into it.
"
,,
7,8,"Straight Camp.
"
,,
7,8,"Straight Camp?
"
,,
7,8,"Yeah, it's where gays are gonna get cured.
"
,,
7,8,"This is dated last year.
"
,,
7,8,"Oh yeah. I just... I just had it lying around.
"
,,
7,8,"I don't know. Goes against everything I believe in.
"
,,
7,8,"But at this point I'm willing to try anything.
"
,,
7,8,"Oh, for the love of penis.
"
,,
7,8,"[Straight Camp]
"
,,
7,8,"What the... Where am I?
"
,,
7,8,"This is Straight Camp, Peter. I'm sorry but I'm doing it for Lois.
"
,,
7,8,"By the time you get out of here you're gonna be back to your old self again.
"
,,
7,8,"Welcome to Straight Camp, everyone.
"
,,
7,8,"You're all here because you've made a choice to renounce your evil sinful ways
"
,,
7,8,"and redeem yourself in the eyes of your lord and saviour Jesus Christ
"
,,
7,8,"who hates many people but none more than homosexuals.
"
,,
7,8,"And through our carefully structured programm you will succeed.
"
,,
7,8,"All right, men, this is Harry the homosexual.
"
,,
7,8,"Say hi to everyone, Harry.
"
,,
7,8,"Hi, fellas.
"
,,
7,8,"I sure love being gay.
"
,,
7,8,"Harry's choice of lifestyle is wrong.
"
,,
7,8,"So we're gonna beat him up for it.
"
,,
7,8,"Now, take these baseball bats and get to it.
"
,,
7,8,"All right, good so far.
"
,,
7,8,"No, no, no, don't use the bats like that.
"
,,
7,8,"No, no, don't use them like that either.
"
,,
7,8,"All right. Look. Just put them down and use your fists.
"
,,
7,8,"No, no, no, not like that.
"
,,
7,8,"All right. This next exercise will train you to talk like a straight man.
"
,,
7,8,"Peter, we'll start with you. Repeat every word I say exactly as I say it.
"
,,
7,8,"Tonight me and my friends Poly and Matty are going out to drink a ton of beers.
"
,,
7,8,"Tonight my friends and I are going out but
"
,,
7,8," we're not drinking because those are empty calories.
"
,,
7,8,"Then we'll play full contact football in the
"
,,
7,8,"park with no pads or helmets.
"
,,
7,8,"Then we're gathering at Allen and Omars for
"
,,
7,8,"bad movie night
"
,,
7,8,"Then its straight to the bars to find
"
,,
7,8,"loose women to have sex with.
"
,,
7,8,"Then its straight to the gym for three hours of
"
,,
7,8,"crunches and extended eye contact with strangers.
"
,,
7,8,"Peter!
"
,,
7,8,"Oh, don't get me that look, Tony.
"
,,
7,8,"That's exactly what you said. I said it right back to you.
"
,,
7,8,"Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry about you, people
"
,,
7,8,"but I didn't know where else to go.
"
,,
7,8,"I haven't seen Peter in two days
"
,,
7,8,"and I just thought he might be here.
"
,,
7,8,"What? Oh my god, Peter's missing?
"
,,
7,8,"Hey, hang on, hang on, hang on
"
,,
7,8,"before anyone gets too worked up.
"
,,
7,8,"I know where Peter is.
"
,,
7,8," Where?
"
,,
7,8," I put him into Straight Camp.
"
,,
7,8,"You what?
"
,,
7,8,"You bastard!
"
,,
7,8,"Brian, why did you do that?
"
,,
7,8,"Well, its just... You seem so unhappy and I just...
"
,,
7,8,"wanted to help you get your husband back.
"
,,
7,8,"Who knows, by now Peter could be completely heterosexual again.
"
,,
7,8,"Stick out your tush!!</i>
"
,,
7,8,"Give them a push!!</i>
"
,,
7,8,"You're doing the French Mistake!!</i>
"
,,
7,8,"VOILA!!
"
,,
7,8,"STOP!
"
,,
7,8,"Lois? What are you doing here?
"
,,
7,8,"I'm here to get you out of this place, Peter.
"
,,
7,8,"I'm taking you back to Scott.
"
,,
7,8,"Really? You're not still upset about my leaving?
"
,,
7,8,"Peter, there's nothing I'd want more than have you back
"
,,
7,8,"but your place is in Scott now.
"
,,
7,8,"I mean a person sexual identity
"
,,
7,8,"is no more a choice than the color of his skin.
"
,,
7,8,"This is who you are, I can't change you.
"
,,
7,8,"And it would be wrong for me to try.
"
,,
7,8,"Ah, Lois, you've made me happier than a
"
,,
7,8,"pig among guinea pigs.
"
,,
7,8,"All right, I think we all on agreement. I'm in charge here.
"
,,
7,8,"Hi, Peter.
"
,,
7,8,"Hi, Scott!
"
,,
7,8,"Guess what? I have a welcome home surprise for you.
"
,,
7,8,"Ah, dish, dish, dish.
"
,,
7,8,"Remember how you told me?
"
,,
7,8,"Your ultimate fantasy was to have in eleven way.
"
,,
7,8,"Oh my god, yes I do. And you so did not even.
"
,,
7,8,"Oh, but I did. Yoohoo, guys.
"
,,
7,8,"Ah, here's my notes about the gay gene.
"
,,
7,8,"Huh. It wears off after two and a half weeks.
"
,,
7,8,"Oh great, now I can't find mrs. Griffins number.
"
,,
7,8,"Okay. Everybody ready?
"
,,
7,8,"Oh god, I feel like I'm kid in the candy store
"
,,
7,8,"who's having sex with a bunch of gay guys.
"
,,
7,8,"Wait a minute.
"
,,
7,8,"What's going on here?
"
,,
7,8,"Holy crap!
"
,,
7,8,"These are mine.
"
,,
7,8,"So, we're just like never gonna talk about this again?
"
,,
7,8,"That's right, sweety.
"
,,
7,8,"Well, I'm just happy to have your father home again.
"
,,
7,8,"Yeah, and thank god everything's back to normal.

7,8,"Take back your fucking horse!

7,9,"What am I doing an interview? Shut up and get a ladder or something!
"
,,
7,9,"Actually yeah. Maybe we are doing an interview.
"
,,
7,9,"So, Stewie, tell us about that new project you have coming up.
"
,,
7,9,"What are you talking about? Get me down, you douche.
"
,,
7,9,"No. First you tell me about that new project.
"
,,
7,9,"Oh, you're so dead.
"
,,
7,9,"Is that the title of your new film?
"
,,
7,9,"Uh... I've been working on a new movie and it's really great. Toss me a rope!
"
,,
7,9,"No, that's not good enough. I want details.
"
,,
7,9,"Grr... I'm gonna slit your throat while you sleep.
"
,,
7,9,"Am... Well... When you working with Jack Black...
"
,,
7,9,"Uh... You just got to keep up, you know.
"
,,
7,9,"I mean he's doing his thing and you got to...
"
,,
7,9,"You got to match his energy level.
"
,,
7,9,"Without looking like you trying to warm up him
"
,,
7,9,"'cause, you know, that's the game you just not gonna win.
"
,,
7,9,"What was it like having a privilege
"
,,
7,9,"of performing the words of Oscar winnier Diablo Cody?
"
,,
7,9,"She's an overpriced cool girl who's got lucky once.
"
,,
7,9,"Uh... That doesn't sound like an interview answer.
"
,,
7,9,"Say something nice about Diablo Cody.
"
,,
7,9,"I... envy the tattoo artist who had that
"
,,
7,9,"huge canvas of arm fat to work with.
"
,,
7,9,"Wonderful. Wonderful. Hey, listen, could you hang with us through the break?
"
,,
7,9,"What?
"
,,
7,9,"We'll be right back with Stewie's co-star Robin Williams.
"
,,
7,9,"No! No, I hate Robin Will... Where you going?
"
,,
7,9,"Stewie!
"
,,
7,9,"What?
"
,,
7,9,"I have to tell you about the future.
"
,,
7,9,"What?
"
,,
7,9,"I have to tell you 'bout the future.
"
,,
7,9,"On the night, I go back...
"
,,
7,9,"Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no, no, no, hang on, Michael.
"
,,
7,9,"I have to tell you about your future.
"
,,
7,9,"Peter, Stewie's on the roof.
"
,,
7,9,"Ah, Nick Jonas is so cute.
"
,,
7,9,"Hey, Peter.
"
,,
7,9,"Yeah?
"
,,
7,9,"PILLOW FIGHT!
"
,,
7,9,"Ah, you bastard.
"
,,
7,9,"Oh my god! Sorry, Lois.
"
,,
7,9,"Peter! What is our infant son doing up on the roof?
"
,,
7,9,"There's a racoon up here.
"
,,
7,9,"Yikes! Looks like I need a distraction.
"
,,
7,9,"Ladies and gentlemen, mr. Conway Twitty.
"
,,
7,9,"Twitty Conway - I See The Want In Your Eyes
"
,,
7,9,"Terrific! Terrific!
"
,,
7,9,"So, Lois, you still pissed at me about Stewie being on the roof?
"
,,
7,9,"Yes, Peter, I am.
"
,,
7,9,"Oh, for crying out loud. If Conway Twitty isn't enough
"
,,
7,9,"to lighten you up, what more is it gonna take?
"
,,
7,9,"A minotaur with Sean Connery's head?
"
,,
7,9,"Is this 31 Spooner st...
"
,,
7,9,"Get out of here. Just get the hell out of here.
"
,,
7,9,"Look, Lois, what do you say we just bury the hatchet, huh?
"
,,
7,9,"We'll stay in tonight, pop some popcorn and watch Jimmy Camel try.
"
,,
7,9,"No, thank you, Peter.
"
,,
7,9,"And even if wanted to, the TV is out.
"
,,
7,9,"There must be something wrong with the dish.
"
,,
7,9,"It's all right, it's all right. I'll fix the dish.
"
,,
7,9,"Where's my screwdriver.
"
,,
7,9,"Ho-ly crap!
"
,,
7,9,"You are not gonna believe what I just found.
"
,,
7,9,"The yellow piece of paper?
"
,,
7,9,"A raffle ticket, Brian.
"
,,
7,9,"But not just any raffle ticket.
"
,,
7,9,"I won this in 1989 from a Honey Nut Cheerios sweepstakes
"
,,
7,9,"and I totally forgot to cash it in.
"
,,
7,9,"It's one free round of golf with famous celebrity.
"
,,
7,9,"Woow. Who's the celebrity?
"
,,
7,9,"I'll give you a hint. Famous football player.
"
,,
7,9,"Had a bit part in Roots. Couple of great scenes in The Towering Inferno.
"
,,
7,9,"Wait a minute...
"
,,
7,9,"Chuck Connors? He was the basketball player and he was in Roots.
"
,,
7,9,"Yeah, he wasn't in The Towering Inferno, you dumb beaver.
"
,,
7,9,"What? I diidn't say nothing.
"
,,
7,9,"Dad, who is it?
"
,,
7,9,"O.J. Simpson.
"
,,
7,9,"Who's that?
"
,,
7,9,"O.J. Simpson on Spooner street.
"
,,
7,9,"Now, that's the story I can sink my teeth into.
"
,,
7,9,"Stick around.
"
,,
7,9,"Peter, why in the world would you want to play golf with O.J. Simpson?
"
,,
7,9,"Why not, Lois. He's The Juice, one of greatest football players ever.
"
,,
7,9,"Peter, he murdered two people.
"
,,
7,9,"What?
"
,,
7,9,"He brutally killed his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman.
"
,,
7,9,"O.J. Simpson?
"
,,
7,9,"Yes!
"
,,
7,9,"Was this in the news?
"
,,
7,9,"Yes, Peter, it was all over the news.
"
,,
7,9,"Wait a minute, if he killed two people, how come he's not in jail?
"
,,
7,9,"He was acquitted.
"
,,
7,9,"Aw... Here you go, everything's fine.
"
,,
7,9,"Well, Peter, it's generally believed that the jury made a mistake.
"
,,
7,9,"You're saying all those guys in their powdered wigs and
"
,,
7,9,"pilgrim hats and their big gross wives were wrong?
"
,,
7,9,"Man, they have to be stupider than you are
"
,,
7,9,"when you fart yourself a wake.
"
,,
7,9,"Hello? What... Who's here? What's going on?
"
,,
7,9,"Whatever's happening here
"
,,
7,9,"just knock it off.
"
,,
7,9,"So I, Peter Griffin, will be playing one free round of golf
"
,,
7,9,"tomorrow with the one and only O.J. Simpson.
"
,,
7,9,"What? Peter, you can't play golf with O.J. Simpson. He's a murderer.
"
,,
7,9,"Oh, you sound just like Lois. No, no, Joe, I don't believe you.
"
,,
7,9,"Oh yeah? Well say that after the soul-searching walk
"
,,
7,9,"around the town to Dust in the Wind.
"
,,
7,9,"Kansas - Dust In The Wind
"
,,
7,9,"Oh my god, Joe, you right.
"
,,
7,9,"O.J. Simpson is a murderer.
"
,,
7,9,"What am I gonna do, I'm playing golf with him tomorrow.
"
,,
7,9,"Well, now wait a minute, Peter.
"
,,
7,9,"This may be an unpresented opportunity
"
,,
7,9,"Maybe you could wear a wire.
"
,,
7,9,"Get O.J. to confess and we could tape the whole thing.
"
,,
7,9,"Wow, imagine it. Peter Griffin - the guy who took down O.J.
"
,,
7,9,"Marsha Clark sure couldn't do it, you dumb beaver.
"
,,
7,9,"Hey! I wasn't even there.
"
,,
7,9,"I was building a canadian damb at the time.
"
,,
7,9,"Did you know that beavers affect ... more than any other animal?
"
,,
7,9,"Except men.
"
,,
7,9,"He was in our house earlier.
"
,,
7,9,"Now remember, Peter, we will be right here in the van if anything goes wrong.
"
,,
7,9,"Just try to get O.J. talking about the murders.
"
,,
7,9,"Do you think he'd be offended if I ask him to sign this basket ball?
"
,,
7,9,"Yeah, I think he'd be very offended.
"
,,
7,9,"All right, Joe, can you hear me?
"
,,
7,9,"Loud and clear, Peter.
"
,,
7,9,"Hi, are you Peter Griffin?
"
,,
7,9,"That's my name, don't put a knife in it.
"
,,
7,9,"Nice to meet you, c'mon, let's t. off.
"
,,
7,9,"Damn it. Would you look at these golf shoes, they're all scuffed up.
"
,,
7,9,"My wife were supposed to polish 'em but clearly she forgot.
"
,,
7,9,"Man, sometimes I just feel like I could just stab her repeatedly.
"
,,
7,9,"White women, huh?
"
,,
7,9,"Jewish waitress too.
"
,,
7,9,"I got this jewish waiter one time. He was awful, didn't tip him.
"
,,
7,9,"You eh... You've doing something bad to a jewish waiter?
"
,,
7,9,"What's up, Peter? I'm sorry, I was focusing on my drive.
"
,,
7,9,"You're doing great, Peter. Just don't let him intimidate you.
"
,,
7,9,"Guys, guys, someone's getting frogged in the clubhouse.
"
,,
7,9,"Quagmire!
"
,,
7,9,"She sounds fat.
"
,,
7,9,"Hey, you know what I like to do sometimes, Juice?
"
,,
7,9,"I like to just confess things I've done to people.
"
,,
7,9,"You know, just clean my ... Makes me feel a whole lot better.
"
,,
7,9,"Anything you'd like to confess?
"
,,
7,9,"No. Not really.
"
,,
7,9,"Peter, we're not really hearing him very well. Can you get closer?
"
,,
7,9,"Um... Are you sure O.J.?
"
,,
7,9,"Are you sure you wouldn't like to confess
"
,,
7,9,"to the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman?
"
,,
7,9,"What?
"
,,
7,9,"What the hell is that?
"
,,
7,9,"You wearing a wire!
"
,,
7,9,"I am so murdered.
"
,,
7,9,"Peter, I'm hurt. How could you decieve me like this?
"
,,
7,9,"Oh god, O.J. please, don't kill me.
"
,,
7,9,"Wait a minute, is this about that whole business back in 1994?
"
,,
7,9,"Well, yeah.
"
,,
7,9,"Down it. That's been chasing me for 13 years.
"
,,
7,9,"And here I was looking forward to a nice day of golf
"
,,
7,9,"away from all those people who have demonized me
"
,,
7,9,"and made me out some kind of bogeyman.
"
,,
7,9,"Even though I was found innocent by jury of my PS.
"
,,
7,9,"But what about the civil trial?
"
,,
7,9,"Believe me, Peter, there was nothing civil about it.
"
,,
7,9,"Well, that makes up for one murder.
"
,,
7,9,"The one thing I'm guilty of is a few bad movies.
"
,,
7,9,"And that makes up for the other murder. I am sold.
"
,,
7,9,"You are so witty and charming.
"
,,
7,9,"That's nice of you to say, Peter.
"
,,
7,9,"It's been so long since I had a friend.
"
,,
7,9,"You poor fella.
"
,,
7,9,"Gosh, there's no way you could have killed anybody.
"
,,
7,9,"Not without sad eyes, I'm gonna make sure everything is gonna be all right.
"
,,
7,9,"Hey everybody, look who I brought home.
"
,,
7,9,"Ten thousand rushing yards, six pro-balls
"
,,
7,9,"two arrests and no convictions. All it's O.J. Simpson.
"
,,
7,9,"Hi, Griffins.
"
,,
7,9," Oh my god!
"
,,
7,9," What the...
"
,,
7,9,"I just think you're terrific
"
,,
7,9,"O.J. this is my family. Family, O.J.
"
,,
7,9,"It's nice to meet you all.
"
,,
7,9,"Hey, Peter, you mind if I use your restroom?
"
,,
7,9,"No, it's upstairs and to the left.
"
,,
7,9,"Peter, are you out of your mind
"
,,
7,9,"bringing O.J. Simpson in our home?
"
,,
7,9,"Look, don't make that face at me, Lois.
"
,,
7,9,"O.J. is innocent, all right?
"
,,
7,9,"Peter, we know he did it.
"
,,
7,9,"Oh, you were there? I didn't realized that.
"
,,
7,9,"Oh, and you didn't do anything to stop it?
"
,,
7,9,"Oh, accessory to murder!
"
,,
7,9,"Why are you so quick to defend this guy?
"
,,
7,9,"Because he was a childhood hero, Brian.
"
,,
7,9,"Yes, he have a few marital problems but I used to look up to him.
"
,,
7,9,"That's it, isn't it? You idolized O.J. Simpson
"
,,
7,9,"as a boy and you just can't accept the fact
"
,,
7,9,"that he's not who you thought he was.
"
,,
7,9,"Right, enough with yepperty yep, O.J. is gonna stay
"
,,
7,9,"here with us in Quahog untill I can help him get his life back on track.
"
,,
7,9,"Hi, Lois.
"
,,
7,9,"Hello, O.J.
"
,,
7,9,"Anything I can do to help make dinner?
"
,,
7,9,"Um... Sure, you can take the lasagne out of the oven.
"
,,
7,9,"You got it.
"
,,
7,9,"Oh, wouldn't you know it, it won't fit.
"
,,
7,9,"Well, it's all right, how hard could it be.
"
,,
7,9,"Oh, Lois, I'm so sorry.
"
,,
7,9,"Uh, it's all right, O.J. Le-let me get something to clean that up.
"
,,
7,9,"OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD!
"
,,
7,9,"Brian, what's the matter?
"
,,
7,9,"Oh, you're alive!
"
,,
7,9,"Yeah, we just had a little pasta spill.
"
,,
7,9,"Oh, thank god!
"
,,
7,9,"It's OK, Brian.
"
,,
7,9,"It's not the first accident we've had in this house.
"
,,
7,9,"OK, one...
"
,,
7,9,"two... Oh-oh, hang on, hang on, Brian. Stop the wheel, stop the wheel.
"
,,
7,9,"I BM'd.
"
,,
7,9,"Hey, Juice! Is it all right if I call you Juice? Great!
"
,,
7,9,"Listen, I was wondering if you could give me a little advise
"
,,
7,9,"on how to murder a woman and get away with it.
"
,,
7,9,"Ah, cool, look an that.
"
,,
7,9,"Hey, Chris, go long.
"
,,
7,9,"Touchdown!
"
,,
7,9,"Good grief.
"
,,
7,9,"What are you doing, O.J.?
"
,,
7,9,"Well, I've got no money left to pay my off civil suit debt.
"
,,
7,9,"So I'm making a god's eye to send to Fred Goldman.
"
,,
7,9,"It's kinda nice, right?
"
,,
7,9,"Better than nothing.
"
,,
7,9,"He's got money to buy tongue depressors and
"
,,
7,9,"yarn but not enough to pay us back?
"
,,
7,9,"You know how much mustache creme I could have bought?
"
,,
7,9,"I don't like the mustache, Fred.
"
,,
7,9,"Nobody likes the mustache.
"
,,
7,9,"That's why we lost the trial.
"
,,
7,9,"That's not true!
"
,,
7,9,"Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.
"
,,
7,9,"And I'm Diane Simmons.
"
,,
7,9,"Our top story tonight
"
,,
7,9,"Quahog, Rhode Island known for quaint neighborhoods
"
,,
7,9,"white sandy beaches and harboring bloodthirsty murderers?
"
,,
7,9,"That's right, Tom. Former murderer O.J. Simpson has moved to Quahog.
"
,,
7,9,"We don't have footage of the murder itself
"
,,
7,9,"but we can show you what's happened
"
,,
7,9,"thanks to this reanactment by the Quahog Opera Company.
"
,,
7,9,"I love you, Nicole
"
,,
7,9,"but I must confess
"
,,
7,9,"to some trepidation
"
,,
7,9,"for I am a lonely waiter
"
,,
7,9,"who loves a loss of a estation (?)
"
,,
7,9,"opera-style song
"
,,
7,9,"Well, it looks like this is one more town
"
,,
7,9,"the medias run me out of.
"
,,
7,9,"Now wait a second, Juice. You can't let them tell you how to live your life.
"
,,
7,9,"You've been running for too long.
"
,,
7,9,"I say you let people get to know you the way I have.
"
,,
7,9,"You really think that's possible, Peter?
"
,,
7,9,"Of course it is. We'll even throw a big party
"
,,
7,9,"and invite everybody in town and I promise, they'll accept you.
"
,,
7,9,"Peter, I really appreciate this but...
"
,,
7,9,"are you sure people are ready?
"
,,
7,9,"Absolutely O.J.
"
,,
7,9,"This party will get you a chance to get to know everybody
"
,,
7,9,"and give them a chance to know a real O.J. Simpson.
"
,,
7,9,"Peter, do you really expect anyone to show up?
"
,,
7,9,"Sure I do. Look, here comes a bunch of people.
"
,,
7,9,"Wow! What a turnout.
"
,,
7,9,"Uh, Peter, that's not a group of enthusiastic party guests
"
,,
7,9,"That's an angry mob.
"
,,
7,9,"We don't want you in our town, Simpson.
"
,,
7,9,"We don't love you like we did in 1993.
"
,,
7,9,"Doh!
"
,,
7,9,"And that's for you O.J.
"
,,
7,9,"We don't want you here either.
"
,,
7,9,"Wow! Wow! Wow!
"
,,
7,9,"Anyone who wants a piece of O.J. has to get by me.
"
,,
7,9,"No, Peter. This is my fight and I'll be the one to fight it.
"
,,
7,9,"Look at you all. Look what you're doing.
"
,,
7,9,"Why you no better than what you made me ought to be.
"
,,
7,9,"Sure I made some mistakes in my life.
"
,,
7,9,"I forget to take the trash out somedays.
"
,,
7,9,"I've left the toothpaste cap on the bathroom counter.
"
,,
7,9,"I've taped football games without the
"
,,
7,9,"expressed written consent of the NFL.
"
,,
7,9,"I guess what I'm saying is
"
,,
7,9,"I'm not perfect.
"
,,
7,9,"The only difference is I have the courage to admit it.
"
,,
7,9,"Does anyone else has the courage?
"
,,
7,9,"If so, why don't you just come on up here and join me?
"
,,
7,9,"He's right, I'm not perfect.
"
,,
7,9,"I suppose, I'm not either.
"
,,
7,9,"Yeah, I guess none of us are perfect.
"
,,
7,9,"Boy, do I feel like a jerk.
"
,,
7,9,"Me too.
"
,,
7,9,"I think we owe you an apology, O.J.
"
,,
7,9,"You see, none of us are perfect.
"
,,
7,9,"Oh, I guess he did do it.
"
,,
7,10,"Check it out guys. New driver's license.
"
,,
7,10,"What's wrong with your picture?
"
,,
7,10,"Well, see, I got drunk and
"
,,
7,10,"then got my picture taken.
"
,,
7,10,"So that way, when I get pulled over
"
,,
7,10,"for drunk driving I'll look the
"
,,
7,10,"same as on my license.
"
,,
7,10,"Y'know, and then the copper,
"
,,
7,10,"copper'll say ""Oh, you're fine,
"
,,
7,10,"you're not drunk.
"
,,
7,10,"This is you normal,
"
,,
7,10," I can tell by the picture.""
"
,,
7,10,"I wish I thought of that.
"
,,
7,10,"I just got my new license a month ago.
"
,,
7,10,"What's with the big grin?
"
,,
7,10,"Oh, I'd just gotten a new tube of
"
,,
7,10,"Aquafresh and I was feeling cocky.
"
,,
7,10,"Hey, let's see yours, Quagmire.
"
,,
7,10,"Hey, wait a second. You were born in 1948?
"
,,
7,10,"Uuh....yeah.
"
,,
7,10,"You're 61 years old?
"
,,
7,10,"Ah, yes sir.
"
,,
7,10,"What's your secret?
"
,,
7,10,"Uh...carrots. Sometimes I grind 'em
"
,,
7,10,"up into juice, or just eat 'em raw.
"
,,
7,10,"Or insert them anally. Long as I
"
,,
7,10,"get 'em into my body somehow.
"
,,
7,10,"Jigga-jigga.
"
,,
7,10,"And now back to the FOX News

7,10," Great, I need another expense
"
,,
7,10,"like I need a hole in the head.
"
,,
7,10,"And I don't need that.
"
,,
7,10,"I'm tellin' you this thing has
"
,,
7,10,"turned out to be nothing but a burden.
"
,,
7,10,"Oh, my God! Peter,
"
,,
7,10,"when did you get that?
"
,,
7,10,"Oh, a few of the fellows
"
,,
7,10,"at work talked me into it.
"
,,
7,10,"Said it was something I might need.
"
,,
7,10,"Wha...? It's horrible.
"
,,
7,10,"The worst thing is, I found
"
,,
7,10,"out I got it on the gay side.
"
,,
7,10," Hey, are you coming out tonight?
"
,,
7,10,"I'm not gay. They put
"
,,
7,10,"the hole in the wrong side.
"
,,
7,10,"All right family. The wait is over.
"
,,
7,10,"I give you......
"
,,
7,10,"High Def television.
"
,,
7,10,"Oooh! Can I have the box?
"
,,
7,10,"Look at me. I'm an
"
,,
7,10,"Iraq war vet in 10 years.
"
,,
7,10,"Naah! We're gonna take good care of them.
"
,,
7,10,"Wow! Look at that HD picture.
"
,,
7,10,"Yeah, it's so clear you can
"
,,
7,10,"even see Ellen DeGeneris' breath.
"
,,
7,10,"Well, my guest today is, uh, Seth Rogan.
"
,,
7,10,"Who's got a new movie out.
"
,,
7,10,"Now, now Seth. This movie is hot.
"
,,
7,10,"It's just hot......hot......hot.
"
,,
7,10,"How's it feel to have
"
,,
7,10,"the hottest film in Hollywood?
"
,,
7,10,"What the #%*$ ???
"
,,
7,10,"And now the real reason to have an HD TV.
"
,,
7,10,"And now the FOX News 6
"
,,
7,10,"o'clock report with Rhonda Latimer.
"
,,
7,10,"In High Definition.
"
,,
7,10,"Good evening everyone and I
"
,,
7,10,"hope you're as thrilled about
"
,,
7,10,"the new format change as I am.
"
,,
7,10,"A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!
"
,,
7,10,"            A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!
"
,,
7,10,"A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!
"
,,
7,10,"            A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!
"
,,
7,10,"A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!
"
,,
7,10,"             A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!
"
,,
7,10,"A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!
"
,,
7,10,"           A-a-a-a-a-a-a!!!
"
,,
7,10,"Oh no.
"
,,
7,10,"Oh no.
"
,,
7,10,"Oh.
"
,,
7,10,"A-a-a-a-a-a!
"
,,
7,10,"I'll get all of the A's out of my body.
"
,,
7,10,"A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a!
"
,,
7,10,"We interrupt this report to
"
,,
7,10,"inform you Rhonda Latimer has
"
,,
7,10,"been relocated to Guantanamo Bay.
"
,,
7,10,"Coming up, the new
"
,,
7,10,"format that makes HD obsolete.
"
,,
7,10,"Son of a bitch!
"
,,
7,10,"Mom, do you ever feel....
"
,,
7,10,"not so fresh down there?
"
,,
7,10,"No. There must be something wrong with you.
"
,,
7,10," Really?
"
,,
7,10," Yeah.
"
,,
7,10,"I've never had that problem
"
,,
7,10,"and I don't know any woman who has.
"
,,
7,10,"Hey, look at this. FOX News is looking
"
,,
7,10,"for a replacement for Rhonda Latimer.
"
,,
7,10,"Hey, mom, you should try out.
"
,,
7,10,"I mean, you majored in journalism
"
,,
7,10,"and you've never done anything with it.
"
,,
7,10,"Well, I did write for my college newspaper.
"
,,
7,10,"Yeah, didn't you do an interview
"
,,
7,10,"with that fast talking FedEx guy?
"
,,
7,10,"Yeah, I ended up dating him for 3 months.
"
,,
7,10,"Thats a beautiful shade of lipstick.
"
,,
7,10,"I bet you enjoy the music of Men at Work.
"
,,
7,10,"You're incredibly foxy.
"
,,
7,10,"Take off your shirt. Take off your pants.
"
,,
7,10,"Wow, what a body, that feels good,
"
,,
7,10,"I'll give you a call. You'd better get tested.
"
,,
7,10,"Yeah, mom, you should be a reporter.
"
,,
7,10,"Well, I mean I guess
"
,,
7,10,"there's no harm in trying out.
"
,,
7,10,"Hey, Lois. A little less yackity-yak,
"
,,
7,10,"little more cuttin' up my banana.
"
,,
7,10,"What am I supposed to do?
"
,,
7,10,"Stick the whole thing in my mouth?
"
,,
7,10,"I mean .... Oh...... hello.
"
,,
7,10,"Lois, you can't possibly be
"
,,
7,10,"considering working for FOX News.
"
,,
7,10,"Well, why not?
"
,,
7,10,"Why not? Because they're
"
,,
7,10,"evil and they distort the truth.
"
,,
7,10,"And they do the
"
,,
7,10,"bidding of the Republican party.
"
,,
7,10,"I mean ... what other
"
,,
7,10,"reasons do you need?
"
,,
7,10,"Don't listen to Brian, Lois.
"
,,
7,10,"You'd be great on camera.
"
,,
7,10,"Like I was, when I played
"
,,
7,10,"that dead body on Law and Order.
"
,,
7,10,"Well, until I got that itch in my crotch.
"
,,
7,10,"The contusion on
"
,,
7,10,"his left temple implies he
"
,,
7,10,"was hit by a blunt object.
"
,,
7,10,"And the cuts imply a struggle.
"
,,
7,10," So it was murder?
"
,,
7,10," But the question is who?
"
,,
7,10,"Well, whoever it was wears nail polish.
"
,,
7,10," We found traces in the wounds.
"
,,
7,10," Well, that narrows it down.
"
,,
7,10,"At least we know it wasn't the father.
"
,,
7,10,"Yeah, but we still gotta find out ...
"
,,
7,10,"Aaaaaaah ......... thank God.
"
,,
7,10,"Alright, FOX News auditions. Take 1.
"
,,
7,10,"And even though this
"
,,
7,10,"Iraqi veteran lost his hands
"
,,
7,10,"he didn't lose his ability to feel.
"
,,
7,10,"I'm Lois Griffen for FOX News.
"
,,
7,10," Great story, Lois.
"
,,
7,10," Thanks. I just made it up.
"
,,
7,10,"Y'know, I've been doing
"
,,
7,10,"this job a long time, and I
"
,,
7,10,"think  you've got what it takes.
"
,,
7,10,"Ha-haa. You're kidding. Really?
"
,,
7,10,"Yes. How would you like to
"
,,
7,10,"be our newest on-air reporter?
"
,,
7,10,"W-w-well ... y'know I came down
"
,,
7,10,"here not even thinking I had a shot
"
,,
7,10,"and now you're telling me this?
"
,,
7,10,"Gosh, it's an awfully big decision.
"
,,
7,10,"Lois, please. Take the job for FOX sake.
"
,,
7,10,"Well .... alright. I'll do it!
"
,,
7,10,"Great. Here's your contract.
"
,,
7,10,"Now run home Lois.
"
,,
7,10,"Run as fast as you can.
"
,,
7,10,"A-a-a-a-a-h.
"
,,
7,10,"A-a-a-a-a-h.
"
,,
7,10,"A-a-a-a-a-h.
"
,,
7,10,"A-a-a-a-a-h.
"
,,
7,10,"A-a-a-a-a-a-h.
"
,,
7,10,"Good morning everyone.
"
,,
7,10,"Well, do I look TV ready?
"
,,
7,10,"Lois, I can't believe you're
"
,,
7,10,"doing this. If you work for FOX News
"
,,
7,10,"you're  going to be selling your soul.
"
,,
7,10,"Oh, Brian, come on!
"
,,
7,10,"They're a major news network.
"
,,
7,10,"I would think you would be excited for me.
"
,,
7,10,"Are you kidding?
"
,,
7,10,"They're a lie factory. They report
"
,,
7,10,"whatever they damn well please.
"
,,
7,10,"Y'know Brian, you're welcome
"
,,
7,10,"to come with me to see for
"
,,
7,10,"yourself that it's all on the level.
"
,,
7,10,"Y'now, I just might
"
,,
7,10,"take you up on that, Lois.
"
,,
7,10,"And I know another way
"
,,
7,10,"we can take advantage of this.
"
,,
7,10,"Chris ... Meg. Meet me in
"
,,
7,10,"the living room in 10 minutes
"
,,
7,10,"and bring a pencil and paper.
"
,,
7,10," Dad? What are we doing?
"
,,
7,10," Meg, now that Lois has connections at FOX,
"
,,
7,10,"we are gonna invent our own cartoon show.
"
,,
7,10,"And we are here to
"
,,
7,10,"brainstorm ideas. Alright, GO!
"
,,
7,10,"Anything that pops into your head.
"
,,
7,10,"Ooh ... how about a show
"
,,
7,10,"about a bunch of disabled ducks
"
,,
7,10,"and we'll call it ""Handi-Quacks.""
"
,,
7,10,"Wow, caught fire a little earlier
"
,,
7,10,"than I thought we would, Perfect!
"
,,
7,10,"Alright, let's spend many hours on this.
"
,,
7,10,"Alright, the main duck ... what's his name?
"
,,
7,10,"I don't know, uh ... Red Hynie Monkey?
"
,,
7,10,"Ha-ha-ha, I love it.
"
,,
7,10,"I love it. Alright, now what's
"
,,
7,10,"his wacky neighbour duck's name?
"
,,
7,10,"Giddy Goose?
"
,,
7,10,"Meg, please try to formulate
"
,,
7,10,"ideas clearly before you vocalize them.
"
,,
7,10,"I'm not sure you're gettin' the show, Meg.
"
,,
7,10,"Alright. Names. Names. Names. C'mon now.
"
,,
7,10,"Poopy Faced Tomato Nose.
"
,,
7,10,"Yes! Write it down.
"
,,
7,10,"Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!
"
,,
7,10,"Maybe they live in a pond?
"
,,
7,10,"Chris, can I talk to
"
,,
7,10,"you in the kitchen for a sec?
"
,,
7,10," I don't think she's gettin' it ...
"
,,
7,10," I know she's not gettin' it, but ...
"
,,
7,10," There's no 'but', she's not gettin' it.
"
,,
7,10," What the hell d'ya wanna do?
"
,,
7,10," She's poison.
"
,,
7,10," Absolutely, she's dead weight.
"
,,
7,10," She doesn't understand.
"
,,
7,10," .....it's just not funny
"
,,
7,10," She's completely ruining it.
"
,,
7,10," Yeah, but I think it's important to
"
,,
7,10,"have a female perspective in the room.
"
,,
7,10,"Alright, then I think we're going to
"
,,
7,10,"have to expect nothing, right, and then
"
,,
7,10," maybe be pleasantly surprised.
"
,,
7,10," OK.
"
,,
7,10,"Welcome to FOX News, Lois.
"
,,
7,10,"We're very excited to have you.
"
,,
7,10,"Well, I'm excited to be here.
"
,,
7,10,"Oh, this is my dog, Brian. He
"
,,
7,10,"was just dying to see the studio.
"
,,
7,10," Well, hi there, Brian.
"
,,
7,10," How's it going, Adolf?
"
,,
7,10,"I'll have you know my
"
,,
7,10,"grandparents died in the holocaust.
"
,,
7,10,"Ha-ha-ha, No, I'm just joking.
"
,,
7,10,"They were there though.
"
,,
7,10,"This whole place just feels like a warm blanket.
"
,,
7,10,"I'll show you to our day
"
,,
7,10,"care facilities shortly, but
"
,,
7,10,"first let's have a look around.
"
,,
7,10,"This is our control room,
"
,,
7,10,"where we have the ability
"
,,
7,10,"to monitor up to 500 different
"
,,
7,10,"news stories in any given hour.
"
,,
7,10," What's that big button do?
"
,,
7,10," Oh, that's kinda fun.
"
,,
7,10,"It emits a noise that only Al Gore can hear.
"
,,
7,10," There it is again.
"
,,
7,10," It's probably just wind, honey.
"
,,
7,10,"It's not the wind!
"
,,
7,10,"And this is the kitchen. We've got all
"
,,
7,10,"kinds of snacks and cold drinks in here.
"
,,
7,10,"Well, I don't see the refrigerator.
"
,,
7,10,"Oh, we just use Anne Coulter.
"
,,
7,10,"Hmmmmm......
"
,,
7,10,"There's never anything good in here.
"
,,
7,10,"Alright, here we go. Handy Quacks.
"
,,
7,10,"Episode 1, scene 1.
"
,,
7,10,"Let's get 'em laughing right off the bat.
"
,,
7,10,"""Interior, Red Hynie Monkey's house.""
"
,,
7,10,"What's Red Hynie Monkey doing?
"
,,
7,10,"Um, maybe he just got up?
"
,,
7,10,"He's making breakfast?
"
,,
7,10,"Ah, I don't think people eat
"
,,
7,10,"breakfast anymore. More suggestions.
"
,,
7,10,"Ooh! What if Red Hynie Monkey
"
,,
7,10,"and Poopy Faced Tomato Nose
"
,,
7,10,"are trying to build a house of cards
"
,,
7,10,"and it keeps falling down?
"
,,
7,10," Oh, ho-ho. Jiminy Christmas, we
"
,,
7,10,"have all been there. That's goin' in.
"
,,
7,10,"Oh, we are cooking.
"
,,
7,10,"Cooking, cooking, cooking.
"
,,
7,10,"Now. Alright. Let's take a walk down
"
,,
7,10,"this road and see where it leads us.
"
,,
7,10,"Dialogue. What are they saying?
"
,,
7,10,"Umm ... maybe Poopy
"
,,
7,10,"Faced  Tomato Nose says, uh ..
"
,,
7,10,"""Boy, this house of cards
"
,,
7,10,"just doesn't wanna stay up.""
"
,,
7,10,"Well, I mean, yeah, if you wanna
"
,,
7,10,"go right at it like a neanderthal
"
,,
7,10,"sure, but I think we're shooting
"
,,
7,10,"for a little more subtilty here, y'know.
"
,,
7,10,"Y'know, I don't believe
"
,,
7,10,"that. I don't believe that that's a
"
,,
7,10,"real conversation when I hear
"
,,
7,10,"it. People don't talk like that, Meg.
"
,,
7,10,"Oooh ...oooh! What if they just
"
,,
7,10,"bought a new wood stove
"
,,
7,10,"and Red Hynie Monkey says,
"
,,
7,10,"""Boy, it's so hot in here because
"
,,
7,10,"we just bought that new wood stove
"
,,
7,10,"(Both) and we're sweating,
"
,,
7,10,"and our hands are all slippery
"
,,
7,10,"and that's why we can't
"
,,
7,10,"get the card house to stay up.""
"
,,
7,10,"Thank you, Chris.
"
,,
7,10,"We have lift off! Ha ha ha!
"
,,
7,10,"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry but none
"
,,
7,10,"of this stuff seems to make sense.
"
,,
7,10,"I mean, we haven't even
"
,,
7,10,"referenced the fact that they're ducks
"
,,
7,10,"or that they're handicapped.
"
,,
7,10,"But the show is called ""Handi-Quacks.""
"
,,
7,10,"Uh-huh. Chris, can
"
,,
7,10,"I see you in the kitchen?
"
,,
7,10," This is not working out. This is not workin' ..
"
,,
7,10," Dad, Dad, she's trying ....
"
,,
7,10," She gets along with everybody.
"
,,
7,10," She does not get along with everybody.
"
,,
7,10," She's kinda hot.
"
,,
7,10," She's 'Office' hot.
"
,,
7,10," You're right. You're right.
"
,,
7,10," She's the only woman around.
"
,,
7,10,"Yeah, in the real world
"
,,
7,10,"she doesn't know about it.
"
,,
7,10,"And in addition to
"
,,
7,10,"everything else, she's GOT B.O.!!
"
,,
7,10,"She's got B.O.
"
,,
7,10,"Alright, Lois, for your first assignment
"
,,
7,10,"we want you to do
"
,,
7,10,"an investigative expose on
"
,,
7,10,"one of America's greatest enemies.
"
,,
7,10,"Oh, that sounds important.
"
,,
7,10,"Who is it?
"
,,
7,10,"Michael Moore.
"
,,
7,10,"Oh, here we go. This is exactly
"
,,
7,10,"what I was talking about, Lois.
"
,,
7,10,"FOX News will take down
"
,,
7,10,"anyone who doesn't agree with them.
"
,,
7,10,"Wha...? Now wait a
"
,,
7,10,"minute, Brian. Give him a chance.
"
,,
7,10,"What exactly do you want me to do?
"
,,
7,10,"We have reason to
"
,,
7,10,"suspect that Michael Moore
"
,,
7,10,"may be a closet homosexual.
"
,,
7,10,"We need you to get the proof.
"
,,
7,10,"Well, if you think that Michael
"
,,
7,10,"Moore's possible homosexuality
"
,,
7,10,"is news worthy, I'll
"
,,
7,10,"do my best to get the story.
"
,,
7,10,"Alright, I have come up
"
,,
7,10,"with a design for Red Hynie Monkey
"
,,
7,10,"the head of the Handi-Quacks.
"
,,
7,10,"I want only positive feedback, please.
"
,,
7,10,"Why does he have such a big red bum?
"
,,
7,10,"Because it's funny, Meg.
"
,,
7,10,"People will tune in
"
,,
7,10,"to Handi-Quacks each week
"
,,
7,10,"and see that big red
"
,,
7,10,"bum and get a big laugh out of it.
"
,,
7,10,"Why? Because it's relatable.
"
,,
7,10," They'll see themselves in it.
"
,,
7,10," I think the design is great, Dad.
"
,,
7,10,"Good note. Good note. OK, now I
"
,,
7,10,"also had a thought for a female character
"
,,
7,10,"who's always nagging at
"
,,
7,10,"Red Hynie Monkey, and telling him not
"
,,
7,10,"to leave his beer cans
"
,,
7,10,"lying around and what-not.
"
,,
7,10,"And her name is Bitch Duck.
"
,,
7,10," That kinda looks like mom.
"
,,
7,10," Not finished talking, Meg.
"
,,
7,10,"OK, and this is Poopy Faced Tomato Nose.
"
,,
7,10,"You can see I gave him a funny little suitcase.
"
,,
7,10,"Now, see the joke
"
,,
7,10,"is, most people only carry
"
,,
7,10,"a suitcase when
"
,,
7,10,"they're going on vacation.
"
,,
7,10,"But Poopy Faced Tomato
"
,,
7,10,"Nose carries one all the time.
"
,,
7,10,"And see, he's got a sleeve
"
,,
7,10,"hangin' out. He didn't pack it right.
"
,,
7,10,"Oh, well, you know
"
,,
7,10,"what could be funny?
"
,,
7,10,"Maybe one week
"
,,
7,10,"he actually goes on vacation.
"
,,
7,10,"And ... he's already got the suitcase.
"
,,
7,10,"Chris, can I see you in the kitchen for a sec?
"
,,
7,10,"Your writing partner is out of her mind.
"
,,
7,10," OK first of all stop calling her my parsha.
"
,,
7,10," She's terrible.
"
,,
7,10," I know that.
"
,,
7,10,"But you know what? It's not fair to her.
"
,,
7,10," Well, that's sort of a cop out.
"
,,
7,10," Having her here is not fair to her.
"
,,
7,10,"Dad, if you want to fire
"
,,
7,10,"her, you go ahead and fire her.
"
,,
7,10,"But don't pretend that
"
,,
7,10,"you're doing it for her benefit.
"
,,
7,10," Don't put that on me, she firing herself.
"
,,
7,10," She's can't fire herself.
"
,,
7,10," No, you decide ...
"
,,
7,10," She's firing herself.
"
,,
7,10," She's can't fire herself.
"
,,
7,10," You decided ...
"
,,
7,10," And her lack of talent and her lack of funniness...
"
,,
7,10,"I just, y'know I just feel that
"
,,
7,10,"you and I have captured lightning
"
,,
7,10,"in a bottle with the Handi-Quacks.
"
,,
7,10," We have. Yes!
"
,,
7,10," And she's just coming in,
"
,,
7,10,"unscrewin' the top and lettin' it all out.
"
,,
7,10,"Meg, you're services will no longer be needed.
"
,,
7,10,"Ah, still nothing.
"
,,
7,10,"I don't understand. The lights
"
,,
7,10,"are on. Somebody must be home.
"
,,
7,10,"Aah! Get down.
"
,,
7,10,"Rush Limbaugh?
"
,,
7,10,"What's he doing coming out
"
,,
7,10,"of Michael Moore's house at this hour?
"
,,
7,10,"Unless .... Oh, my God.
"
,,
7,10,"Oh, my God, it's true!
"
,,
7,10,"Michael Moore is
"
,,
7,10,"gay with Rush Limbaugh!
"
,,
7,10,"And I just laid in dog poop.
"
,,
7,10,"That's not dog poop.
"
,,
7,10,"Sorry, we've been out here a long time.
"
,,
7,10,"And look, there's Rush
"
,,
7,10,"Limbaugh coming out of Michael
"
,,
7,10,"Moore's house at 2 in the morning.
"
,,
7,10,"I wouldn't believe
"
,,
7,10,"it if I hadn't seen it myself.
"
,,
7,10,"Well, your dog was right,
"
,,
7,10,"Lois. Looks like there's no story here.
"
,,
7,10," Michael Moore is clearly not gay.
"
,,
7,10," Wha...? No story?
"
,,
7,10,"What are you talking about?
"
,,
7,10,"You're the one who sent me to
"
,,
7,10,"investigate, and now I'm showing
"
,,
7,10,"you proof and you're dismissing it?
"
,,
7,10,"I don't understand.
"
,,
7,10,"Lois, I'll be honest.
"
,,
7,10,"Rush Limbaugh is one of us.
"
,,
7,10,"We have no wish to smear a fellow conservative.
"
,,
7,10,"That would be as foolish as F.D.R
"
,,
7,10,"hiring that midget press secretary.
"
,,
7,10,"The President has just
"
,,
7,10,"confirmed a devastating surprise attack
"
,,
7,10,"by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor.
"
,,
7,10,"Much of our naval
"
,,
7,10,"fleet has been destroyed
"
,,
7,10,"and the death toll is
"
,,
7,10,"believed to be in the thousands.
"
,,
7,10,"He's adorable!
"
,,
7,10,"OK, actors. Welcome to the
"
,,
7,10,"first voice record for Handi-Quacks.
"
,,
7,10,"Alright. Episode 1. ""What the Duck?""
"
,,
7,10,"Take 1.
"
,,
7,10,"Oh, darn it, Poopy Faced Tomato Nose.
"
,,
7,10,"I know, Red Hynie Monkey.
"
,,
7,10,"This card house won't stay up.
"
,,
7,10,"Probably because the
"
,,
7,10,"wood stove is so warm.
"
,,
7,10,"It's making our
"
,,
7,10,"hands sweaty and slippery.
"
,,
7,10,"It's all comin' together.
"
,,
7,10,"It's all comin' together.
"
,,
7,10,"This is it. Our vision. Come to life.
"
,,
7,10,"I know. Just listen to that voice.
"
,,
7,10,"And then picture him holding that
"
,,
7,10,"suitcase with the sleeve sticking out.
"
,,
7,10,"Ha-ha.
"
,,
7,10," Hi, everybody.
"
,,
7,10," Hello, Colonel Tush Finger.
"
,,
7,10,"I just built a space ship. Wanna
"
,,
7,10,"come up in space with me in it?
"
,,
7,10,"Whoa. Whoah, Whoah, Whoah.
"
,,
7,10,"Cut. Cut. Cut, Cut.
"
,,
7,10,"Cleveland. What are you doing?
"
,,
7,10,"I just figured I'd give Colonel
"
,,
7,10,"Tush Finger an Australian thing.
"
,,
7,10,"Colonel Tush Finger
"
,,
7,10,"lives on the moon, you idiot!
"
,,
7,10,"He talks with a moon accent. Y'know?
"
,,
7,10,"He. talks. like. this.
"
,,
7,10,"with. a. moon. accent.
"
,,
7,10,"You understand? I. am. Colonel.
"
,,
7,10,"Tush. Finger. and. I. live. on. the. moon
"
,,
7,10,"so. I. talk. like. this.
"
,,
7,10,"with. a. moon. accent. Do that!
"
,,
7,10," You know, Bonnie also acts.
"
,,
7,10," Oh, here we go.
"
,,
7,10,"So they want me to drop the
"
,,
7,10,"story completely because they don't
"
,,
7,10,"want to embarrass Rush Limbaugh.
"
,,
7,10,"Now do you see what
"
,,
7,10,"I was saying about FOX News?
"
,,
7,10,"They have an incredibly biased agenda.
"
,,
7,10," You should do the story anyway.
"
,,
7,10," You think so?
"
,,
7,10,"Absolutely. They're hypocrites. They
"
,,
7,10,"wanted you to do the story when they
"
,,
7,10,"thought it would embarrass Michael
"
,,
7,10,"Moore, but they don't want you to
"
,,
7,10,"do it if it's going to
"
,,
7,10,"embarrass Rush Limbaugh.
"
,,
7,10,"But you didn't want me
"
,,
7,10,"to do the story when it was
"
,,
7,10,"gonna embarrass Michael Moore.
"
,,
7,10,"But you want me to
"
,,
7,10,"do the story if it's gonna
"
,,
7,10,"embarrass Rush Limbaugh?
"
,,
7,10,"Can you picture the 2 of those
"
,,
7,10,"guys pokin' each other in the chops?
"
,,
7,10,"Eeuugh! It'd be like sticking
"
,,
7,10,"your arm in a backed up sink.
"
,,
7,10,"OK. You're right. I'm a little biased
"
,,
7,10,"myself but at least I'm willing to admit it.
"
,,
7,10,"Imagine that? The 2 of them going at it?
"
,,
7,10,"An oversized Armani suit and an
"
,,
7,10,"oversized cheap wind breaker
"
,,
7,10,"tossed casually on the floor.
"
,,
7,10,"Look, they started this,
"
,,
7,10,"Lois. But it's up to you to finish it.
"
,,
7,10,"I guess you're right, Brian.
"
,,
7,10,"Next day at work, Limbaugh finds
"
,,
7,10,"a Detroit Tigers ball cap up in there.
"
,,
7,10," Stewie, shut up!
"
,,
7,10," Why? It's just a weird image.
"
,,
7,10,"Like the way Commissioner Gordon
"
,,
7,10,"tells Batman that he just took a poop.
"
,,
7,10,"Eeuugh! I don't need to know about that.
"
,,
7,10,"Thanks for hearing our pitch, Mr Chernin.
"
,,
7,10,"You realise that the only
"
,,
7,10,"reason I'm taking this meeting is that
"
,,
7,10,"your wife is a reporter for our news division?
"
,,
7,10,"You have absolutely no prior credits.
"
,,
7,10,"Sir, I promise you won't regret it.
"
,,
7,10,"Handi-Quacks is going to be the next Simpsons.
"
,,
7,10,"We fire the jokes at you
"
,,
7,10,"like an automatic weapon of comedy.
"
,,
7,10,"We throw a curve ball joke
"
,,
7,10,"at you, hit you right in the head
"
,,
7,10,"You go ""Wow, what happened?""
"
,,
7,10,"Hmmmmmmm.
"
,,
7,10,"We take you on a little trolley ride
"
,,
7,10,"down story lane. You're havin' a good time,
"
,,
7,10,"enjoying out little tale, think
"
,,
7,10,"you know what's coming. BOOM!
"
,,
7,10,"Left turn! You don't know how
"
,,
7,10,"it happened. You don't know
"
,,
7,10,"where you are, but you like it.
"
,,
7,10,"Uh-huh?
"
,,
7,10,"You're watchin' the show. The ducks are sayin' stuff.
"
,,
7,10,"You're yukking it up, you're
"
,,
7,10,"laughing, your sides are hurting.
"
,,
7,10,"All of a sudden you realise,
"
,,
7,10,"you're feeling something too.
"
,,
7,10,"When did that happen?
"
,,
7,10,"When did the Handi-Quacks
"
,,
7,10,"become people I care about?
"
,,
7,10,"When did they become like
"
,,
7,10,"welcome guests in your home
"
,,
7,10,"whose weekly visits the
"
,,
7,10,"whole family eagerly awaits?
"
,,
7,10,"Take a look at what we got, Peter.
"
,,
7,10,"# One day 3 ducks
"
,,
7,10,"were crossing the road #
"
,,
7,10,"# Going to get some soda #
"
,,
7,10,"# But they weren't looking
"
,,
7,10,"where they were going #
"
,,
7,10,"# And a bus came along and hit them all #
"
,,
7,10,"# Now they're handicap-ded
"
,,
7,10,"Yeah ... Uh ... N-no, that's pretty much it..
"
,,
7,10,"# Handi-Quacks #
"
,,
7,10,"# And they never got their soda #
"
,,
7,10,"Why won't this card house stay up?
"
,,
7,10,"Our palms are slippery and sweaty
"
,,
7,10,"because of the heat from that
"
,,
7,10,"new wood stove we just bought.
"
,,
7,10,"(Giggles) That's gonna be his catch phrase.
"
,,
7,10,"How did you afford that wood stove?
"
,,
7,10,"Easy. I just walked into
"
,,
7,10,"the wood stove store and said
"
,,
7,10,"""Put it on my bill.""
"
,,
7,10," Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
"
,,
7,10," Ah ha ha. You with me?
"
,,
7,10," I sure am.
"
,,
7,10," You're with me now?
"
,,
7,10," I love it.
"
,,
7,10," You know you love it.
"
,,
7,10,"I just have one small change.
"
,,
7,10," Oh?
"
,,
7,10," Could Poopy Faced
"
,,
7,10,"Tomato Nose's nose be a plum?
"
,,
7,10,"How dare you?
"
,,
7,10,"It's a small change. And if you do
"
,,
7,10,"it, we'll really get behind this show.
"
,,
7,10,"A plum? What is this .... 1986?
"
,,
7,10,"Well, if you're gonna
"
,,
7,10,"be a TV producer, you've
"
,,
7,10,"gotta be open to collaboration.
"
,,
7,10,"So everybody just
"
,,
7,10,"gets to stick their big chef's
"
,,
7,10,"spoon  into my comedy gumbo, eh?
"
,,
7,10,"Well, no deal!
"
,,
7,10,"You know something? I like your passion.
"
,,
7,10,"OK, we'll do the show, and we'll do it your way.
"
,,
7,10,"No.
"
,,
7,10,"Well, that was a miscalculation.
"
,,
7,10,"Alright, there it is. Stay close to me.
"
,,
7,10,"Aah, this is it. Let's go.
"
,,
7,10,"Mr Moore. Mr Limbaugh.
"
,,
7,10,"Do you have anything to say to
"
,,
7,10,"FOX News about this ...
"
,,
7,10,"What the hell??
"
,,
7,10,"Who are you?
"
,,
7,10,"What's that suit on the bed?
"
,,
7,10,"And what have you done
"
,,
7,10,"with your gay lover, Rush Limbaugh?
"
,,
7,10,"Aaaah. I am Rush
"
,,
7,10,"Limbaugh. That's a costume.
"
,,
7,10,"Wait a minute! You mean
"
,,
7,10,"all these years Rush Limbaugh
"
,,
7,10,"has just been Michael Moore in disguise?
"
,,
7,10,"Well, it's a little more complex than that.
"
,,
7,10,"What are you talkin' about?
"
,,
7,10," Fred Savage?!
"
,,
7,10," Wait a minute. You're Rush
"
,,
7,10,"Limbaugh AND Michael Moore?
"
,,
7,10,"Yes I am. They're both characters I created.
"
,,
7,10,"But ...... why?
"
,,
7,10,"Well, after the Wonder
"
,,
7,10,"Years I was hungry to do more
"
,,
7,10,"acting but the pickings were slim
"
,,
7,10,"so I came up with this
"
,,
7,10,"scheme to satisfy my need to perform
"
,,
7,10,"and I guess it got a little out of hand.
"
,,
7,10,"This is unbelievable.
"
,,
7,10,"Well that's not the end of it.
"
,,
7,10,"I'm also Tony Danza, Camryn
"
,,
7,10,"Manheim, Malcolm-Jamar Warner,
"
,,
7,10,"Kevin Nealon, John Forsythe, 
"
,,
7,10,"and Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich.
"
,,
7,10,"Wow! Fred Savage is the
"
,,
7,10,"greatest actor in the history of the world.
"
,,
7,10,"That's all I ever wanted people to know.
"
,,
7,10,"Well if you let us run this
"
,,
7,10,"story, I promise you they will.
"
,,
7,10,"You got a deal.
"
,,
7,10,"Well, it finally happened.
"
,,
7,10,"I had finally gotten
"
,,
7,10,"the recognition I deserved.
"
,,
7,10,"I don't need you anymore!!
"
,,
7,10,"This Sunday on FOX, it's the new hit comedy
"
,,
7,10,"starring America's greatest actor, Fred Savage.
"
,,
7,10,"Well, Lois, you did a
"
,,
7,10,"good thing for a talented guy.
"
,,
7,10,"Yeah, but that should've been our timeslot.
"
,,
7,10,"Well I'm just glad that
"
,,
7,10,"everything's back to normal.
"
,,
7,10,"I don't think I was cut
"
,,
7,10,"out to be a TV reporter.
"
,,
7,10,"Yeah, how did you lose your job there anyway?
"
,,
7,10,"Oh, I don't know.
"
,,
7,10,"Do you really care, Peter?
"
,,
7,10,"Does anyone really care?
"
,,
7,10,"Yeah, you're right.
"
,,
7,10,"The story's over. Everything
"
,,
7,10,"will be back to normal next week.
"
,,
7,10,"So yeah, who gives a damn.
"
,,
7,10,"Anybody got any more jokes?
"
,,
7,10,"Stewie? Anything funny? No?
"
,,
7,10,"Brian? Meg? Chris?
"
,,
7,10,"No?
"
,,
7,10,"Alright. See ya folks.
"
,,
7,11,"The annual Quahog Star Trek convention.
"
,,
7,11,"Where once a year sci-fi buffs take their lips off the barrel of the loaded gun
"
,,
7,11,"and spend half a day adjusting their eyes to sunlight
"
,,
7,11,"Oh, this sucks, mom. Why are we even here?
"
,,
7,11,"Honey, your father's been waiting all year for this.
"
,,
7,11,"Especially since he got kicked out of the last one.
"
,,
7,11,"Yes, I have a question for Captain Kirk.
"
,,
7,11,"Uh, in that episode where you drown your wife, why are you so fat?
"
,,
7,11,"Brian, look. I've purchased authentic blue prints to build a Star Trek transporter.
"
,,
7,11,"That's great Stewie. You should get William Shatner to sign 'em for you.
"
,,
7,11,"No way. I'm getting Patrick Stewart to sign it.
"
,,
7,11,"Picard has it all over Kirk.
"
,,
7,11,"He's poised and measured and doesn't wear a chear lug.
"
,,
7,11,"Rather he excepts even boldness with a quiet cool that says:
"
,,
7,11,"""I am in command. You are safe with me.
"
,,
7,11,"I will cradle you in my arms though any crisis in any galaxy.""
"
,,
7,11," Are you queer?
"
,,
7,11," Probably
"
,,
7,11,"Dad, this is stupid. I'm so bored.
"
,,
7,11,"How can you be bored? This convention has everything!
"
,,
7,11,"You can even try LeVar Burton's visor!
"
,,
7,11,"Why would he wear these? Who would invent these for him?
"
,,
7,11,"And in conclusion,
"
,,
7,11,"whether your dreams are earthbound or set in the stars - follow your heart.
"
,,
7,11,"And.. make it so.
"
,,
7,11,"Ooooh, oh boy. He always says the things he says on TV
"
,,
7,11,"Now the cast and I would be happy to answer a few questions.
"
,,
7,11,"Oh, yes, so many questions. Me, me!
"
,,
7,11,"Mr. Stewart! Mr. Stewart! Mr. Stewart! Mr. Stewart!
"
,,
7,11,"Yes, you there.
"
,,
7,11,"Yes, I have a question.
"
,,
7,11,"Um, often times my household's sponges accumulate
"
,,
7,11,"an awful amount of buildup.
"
,,
7,11," What can I do to prevent this?
"
,,
7,11," That's an exellent question.
"
,,
7,11,"It's very important to thoroughly wring out your sponges after every usage.
"
,,
7,11,"This will prevent the accumulation of grime and bacteria.
"
,,
7,11,"A dry sponge is a happy sponge.
"
,,
7,11,"That's not a Star Trek question!
"
,,
7,11,"I have a question for Jonathan Frakes.
"
,,
7,11,"I have this itch on the back of my leg.
"
,,
7,11,"And I can't figure out if it's a bug bite or dry skin?
"
,,
7,11," Do you take hot showers?
"
,,
7,11," Yes.
"
,,
7,11," Dry skin.
"
,,
7,11," Thanks.
"
,,
7,11,"These aren't Star Trek questions, what the hell?
"
,,
7,11,"I have a question for Gates McFadden
"
,,
7,11,"I've got an artesian well on my property and the water pressure is lousy.
"
,,
7,11," Any suggestions?
"
,,
7,11," I would check the point first, before re-priming it.
"
,,
7,11,"But remember that the summer months take a particular toll on any region's aquafer, depending on the local climate.
"
,,
7,11," This is horseshit!
"
,,
7,11," And that's the last question
"
,,
7,11,"Thank you for coming. You've been wonderful.
"
,,
7,11,"You bastards. I'll get my question answered one way or another.
"
,,
7,11,"Oh my God, what a great costume!
"
,,
7,11,"Meg, Meg! Come take your picture with this space alien guy!
"
,,
7,11," No dad, I don't want to!
"
,,
7,11," Come on, it'll be funny.
"
,,
7,11,"What a wonderful novelty photo this will make.
"
,,
7,11,"Thank you so much buddy. Hey, how did you make that awesome mask?
"
,,
7,11,"It's not a mask, I have the mumps.
"
,,
7,11,"What? You came to a Star Trek convention with the mumps,
"
,,
7,11,"you could be infecting people with a disease!
"
,,
7,11,"Yeah, like that old gipsy did to Britney Spears in that Stephen King book.
"
,,
7,11,"Thicker.
"
,,
7,11,"Well, Meg has the mumps alright.
"
,,
7,11,"How is it she was never immunised.
"
,,
7,11,"Well, it was 1992 and I couldn't be bothered with
"
,,
7,11,"anything that didn't involved Dan Cortese
"
,,
7,11," Besides, what's a big deal? I never got a mumps shot.
"
,,
7,11," Really?
"
,,
7,11,"Well, I caution you, that getting the mumps as an adult could result a serious complications.
"
,,
7,11,"In some cases the symptoms could spread to the testicular glands.
"
,,
7,11,"Big deal, so I wear socks.
"
,,
7,11,"Mr. Griffin, your testicles are not on your feet.
"
,,
7,11," Oh, where are they?
"
,,
7,11," Under your penis.
"
,,
7,11,"Are you kidding? I always thought those were two
"
,,
7,11,"little sandbags to keep floodwaters from floating into my bum
"
,,
7,11,"No, no. I'm just poking at your funny bone. I am quite alarmed.
"
,,
7,11,"I don't think you realize the danger.
"
,,
7,11,"Like the people who think it's OK to bring shampoo on an airplane.
"
,,
7,11,"So I told Brenda:
"
,,
7,11,"I work hard, I like a clean house when I come home.
"
,,
7,11,"And now I'm the bad guy.
"
,,
7,11,"Oh, I know exacltly what you...
"
,,
7,11," Oh, It's in my eyes!
"
,,
7,11,"See, Chris, come here, come here, look. Check it out.
"
,,
7,11," Holy crap, no way!
"
,,
7,11," I know, classic!
"
,,
7,11,"I gotta forward this to my bud.
"
,,
7,11,"Meg, I know you hate having to be in bed all day, but
"
,,
7,11,"your father's bringing in the old TV.
"
,,
7,11," Hey Meg!
"
,,
7,11," Peter, what the hell?
"
,,
7,11," I don't wanna catch the mumps, Lois.
"
,,
7,11,"Here's your TV, Meg. It's a little old and there is no remote
"
,,
7,11,"and it only gets one channel and it's not on that channel right now.
"
,,
7,11,"Chris, check it out. Jackass number two.
"
,,
7,11,"This whole day is been one big laugh riot.
"
,,
7,11," Finally!
"
,,
7,11," Up next Kirk Cameron.
"
,,
7,11," To talk about God.
"
,,
7,11," Aww.
"
,,
7,11,"Hi, welcome to the Religion channel number one show.
"
,,
7,11,"""Kirk and the Lord"" just hanging. With me, Kirk Cameron.
"
,,
7,11,"Today, I'm gonna tell you why God will always be there for you.
"
,,
7,11," Even in the worst of times.
"
,,
7,11," No thanks.
"
,,
7,11,"But first, are you lonely, unappreciated?
"
,,
7,11,"Not totally happy with your physical appearance?
"
,,
7,11," Go on.
"
,,
7,11,"Are you unloved? Do you feel like no one cares about you?
"
,,
7,11,"Meg, your mother made soup for you.
"
,,
7,11,"Here you go honey.
"
,,
7,11,"Well, you know who does love you? The Lord.
"
,,
7,11,"Here's your milk!
"
,,
7,11,"Rupert, my transporter is complete.
"
,,
7,11,"If my calculations are correct the cast of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation""
"
,,
7,11,"will soon be here to anwser all my questions!
"
,,
7,11,"Wait a minute, something's wrong.
"
,,
7,11,"Alright, you girls ready?
"
,,
7,11,"What's goin on? Don't you laugh at it?
"
,,
7,11,"Good morning mom and dad!
"
,,
7,11,"Wow, look who's finally out of her room after five days.
"
,,
7,11," So you feel better Meg?
"
,,
7,11," All better mom.
"
,,
7,11,"I was made well by the hand of God.
"
,,
7,11,"This is the day that the Lord hath made.
"
,,
7,11,"Let us rejoice and be glad in it.
"
,,
7,11," Meg, what are you talking about?
"
,,
7,11," I'm talking about God mom, I've been reborn.
"
,,
7,11,"That's right folks. It's gonna be a Meg episode. Stick around for the fun.
"
,,
7,11,"Here's the clicker. No one'd blame ya.
"
,,
7,11," What do you mean you found the Lord?
"
,,
7,11," I've been washed in the blood of the lamb.
"
,,
7,11,"Kirk Cameron explained it all to me. The Lord is my saviour.
"
,,
7,11,"It's that damn religion channel. She was watching it all day while she was bedridden.
"
,,
7,11,"I want to share the word of God with everyone I know.
"
,,
7,11,"Starting with my family.
"
,,
7,11,"Now, everyone hold hands because we are gonna say grace before we eat.
"
,,
7,11,"Dad, would you like to do the honors?
"
,,
7,11,"Are you kidding? I'd love a chance to shine.
"
,,
7,11,"All right Peter, this is it.
"
,,
7,11,"Dear Lod, please give me the cheat codes from ""Mike Tyson's Punch-Out""
"
,,
7,11,"I have been stuck on ""Bold Ball"" for four years.
"
,,
7,11,"I tried Left-Left-Up-B-dodge-uppercut, but it still knocks me out.
"
,,
7,11,"And you know, they say your supposed to go
"
,,
7,11,"Right-B-Up-dodge-Left-uppercu...
"
,,
7,11,"Listen to me, telling you how to play a game.
"
,,
7,11,"All right, let's try this again.
"
,,
7,11,"It's them. I did it!
"
,,
7,11,"The cast of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation""
"
,,
7,11,"is here to anwser my questions!
"
,,
7,11," What the hell, where am I?
"
,,
7,11," What's goin on?
"
,,
7,11,"Greeting everyone, my name is Stewie Griffin.
"
,,
7,11,"I've transported you all here against your will.
"
,,
7,11,"I'm a huge fan. And you are going to answer all my questions.
"
,,
7,11," But.. you're a baby.
"
,,
7,11," Yes, that's right Denise Crosby.
"
,,
7,11,"That was a warning. Please,
"
,,
7,11,"do not speak unless you are spoken to.
"
,,
7,11,"Now. Question number one.
"
,,
7,11,"What's it like on the set?
"
,,
7,11,"The show's been off the air for fifteen years
"
,,
7,11,"Although I will say it was an awful lot of fun.
"
,,
7,11,"You know, when Patrick wasn't hogging the limelight.
"
,,
7,11,"Oh fuck you Michael! Fifteen years later you still got that attitude.
"
,,
7,11,"Oh my God! I'm already having a fantastic time.
"
,,
7,11," Let's spend a day together!
"
,,
7,11," Hey, that sounds like fun!
"
,,
7,11," Shut up Wil.
"
,,
7,11," Stop it Patrick!
"
,,
7,11," You know, I think you should all be nicer to Hwil Hwheaton
"
,,
7,11," The way I treat my...
"
,,
7,11," Wait, what?
"
,,
7,11," I said you ought to be nicer to Hwil Hwheaton
"
,,
7,11," You mean Wil Wheaton?
"
,,
7,11," Yes, Hwil Hwheaton.
"
,,
7,11,"Why are you saing it like that?
"
,,
7,11,"What? I'm just saying, you should be nicer to Hwil Hwheaton.
"
,,
7,11,"Hwil Hwheaton seems like a nice guy.
"
,,
7,11," Say ""wheat""
"
,,
7,11," Wheat.
"
,,
7,11," Now, say Wil Wheaton
"
,,
7,11," Hwil Hwheaton
"
,,
7,11," Wil Wheaton
"
,,
7,11," Hwil Hwheaton
"
,,
7,11," Wil Wheaton
"
,,
7,11," Hey, did you hook up with Whoopi Goldberg on the show?
"
,,
7,11,"All the time.
"
,,
7,11," Meg, what the hell? I was watching that.
"
,,
7,11,"It's time for Kirk Cameron!
"
,,
7,11,"And I think it's important for all of you to hear his
"
,,
7,11,"inspiring message about the word of God.
"
,,
7,11,"Oh, again Meg?
"
,,
7,11,"You know I think it's wonderful you found something to have
"
,,
7,11,"faith in but there is such a thing as moderation.
"
,,
7,11,"Mum, you sound like a non-believer.
"
,,
7,11,"Brian, you're thoughtful person.
"
,,
7,11,"Are you willing to open yourself up to God's truth?
"
,,
7,11,"Oh, you're barking up the wrong tree, Meg, I'm an atheist.
"
,,
7,11," What's that?
"
,,
7,11," I.. don't believe in God.
"
,,
7,11,"What? Brian?
"
,,
7,11," How can you say that?
"
,,
7,11," Why? I just thought
"
,,
7,11,"you knew. I mean, I never go to church.
"
,,
7,11,"You know how I feel about that.
"
,,
7,11,"Brian, it's one thing to bash organized religion, but
"
,,
7,11,"we believe in God in this house,
"
,,
7,11,"I mean an atheist... that's just about the worst thing a person can be!
"
,,
7,11,"You're not gonna get anything for Christmas, Brian!
"
,,
7,11," Guys, I'm just trying to say..
"
,,
7,11," Shut up beast!
"
,,
7,11,"I have dominion over you and I command you to believe in God!
"
,,
7,11,"I'm sorry, I just don't see any evidence.
"
,,
7,11,"I mean, look at the Hubble telescope.
"
,,
7,11,"It's discovered untold wonders of a vast unexplored universe.
"
,,
7,11,"But not one picture of a guy with a beard sitting around on a cloud.
"
,,
7,11,"I mean what's he doing up there?
"
,,
7,11,"You know, you keep talking like that, God's gonna get you, Brian.
"
,,
7,11,"He's gonna get you with the Kodak disc.
"
,,
7,11,"Oh God's gonna get you with the Kodak disc!
"
,,
7,11,"I'm sorry. What were we talking about?
"
,,
7,11,"Hey! Where the hell is my van?
"
,,
7,11,"Stewie, I'm not really much of a fast food eater.
"
,,
7,11,"Yeah? Can you read my mind?
"
,,
7,11,"Can you tell what I'm thinking right now?
"
,,
7,11,"I'm thinking ""Shut up and get a salad""
"
,,
7,11," I want some McNuggets!
"
,,
7,11," We'll get to you, Brent.
"
,,
7,11,"I'm wanna hamburger. No, a cheeseburger.
"
,,
7,11," I wanna hotdog, I wanna milk shake
"
,,
7,11," You'll get nothing and like it!
"
,,
7,11," Hello?
"
,,
7,11," Yes, welcome to MacDonald's. Can I help you?
"
,,
7,11,"Hailing frequency's open, huh?
"
,,
7,11,"Oh yeah, we're gonna get two McChicken
"
,,
7,11,"sandwiches and a diet coke and..
"
,,
7,11," What do you want Michael?
"
,,
7,11," A McB.L.T.
"
,,
7,11,"No, I already told you they don't make those anymore!
"
,,
7,11,"You know, sometimes it's a regional thing.
"
,,
7,11," You could ask.
"
,,
7,11," No MacDonald's anywhere makes a McB.L.T anymore!
"
,,
7,11," I'd love a shamrock shake if they got any of those.
"
,,
7,11," It's September Jonathan!
"
,,
7,11,"Stewie, can I take this fucking headband off?
"
,,
7,11,"No LeVar, you're blind, that's the only way you can see.
"
,,
7,11,"Just saying they have all the ingredients for a McB.L.T.
"
,,
7,11,"Just hang on, alright? There's a lot of us, it, there's a lot of.. It's a big order!
"
,,
7,11," What time do they stop serving breakfast?
"
,,
7,11," It's 3 o'clock!
"
,,
7,11," Some of them serve breakfast allday.
"
,,
7,11," NO ONE SERVE BREAKFAST ALLDAY!
"
,,
7,11,"Do they have beer?
"
,,
7,11,"Hey Brian! In hope you'll open your heart to God
"
,,
7,11,"I wanted to give you this cross.
"
,,
7,11," No, I don't wanna cross.
"
,,
7,11," Would you want it if I threw it over there?
"
,,
7,11," No, please don't do that.
"
,,
7,11," You gonna get it boy?
"
,,
7,11," No, please, no.
"
,,
7,11," Go get it boy!
"
,,
7,11,"Okay, give it back now!
"
,,
7,11,"Brian, Kirk Cameron is the one who converted me
"
,,
7,11,"but unfortunately he's not available.
"
,,
7,11,"So, I got his younger brother from ""Growing Pains""
"
,,
7,11,"Would you guys buy me a case of Sudafed?
"
,,
7,11,"Don't you wanna tell Brian about Jesus?
"
,,
7,11,"They got my picture up at the drug store
"
,,
7,11,"and they won't sell me any Sudafed.
"
,,
7,11,"I'll make it worth your while.
"
,,
7,11,"Ben.
"
,,
7,11,"Dad.
"
,,
7,11,"Ben.
"
,,
7,11,"What have I told you about trading sexual favors for sudafed?
"
,,
7,11,"Look, Meg. I've had enough of this. You not gonna convert me.
"
,,
7,11,"But Brian! I just want you to feel the joy that I feel.
"
,,
7,11,"I mean the Church makes me feel accepted and safe
"
,,
7,11,"and part of something bigger that myself.
"
,,
7,11,"But Meg, you don't need an outside voice to feel those feelings,
"
,,
7,11,"they're inside you.
"
,,
7,11,"What you call ""God"" is inside you, all of us.
"
,,
7,11,"And I just hate to see people hating and killing each other
"
,,
7,11,"over their own interpretation of what they're not smart enough to understand.
"
,,
7,11," You see what I'm saying?
"
,,
7,11," Oh I do Brian
"
,,
7,11,"And I think I know just what to do.
"
,,
7,11,"Good evening, I'm Tom Taker. Our top story tonight.
"
,,
7,11,"Just when you thought the world couldn't be any more dangerous
"
,,
7,11,"Channel 5 News has discovered that there is an atheist among us.
"
,,
7,11,"Local church goer and juniour christian soldier Meg Griffin
"
,,
7,11,"has identified the atheist as Brian Griffin of Spooner Street
"
,,
7,11,"Here's the reaction from City Hall.
"
,,
7,11,"Shocking to say the least.
"
,,
7,11,"I'd rather have a terrorist living on our midst.
"
,,
7,11,"At least they belive in a God. Even if it's a smelly brown God.
"
,,
7,11,"Meg, how the hell could you do something like this?
"
,,
7,11,"If a man hath ears, let him hear, Brian!
"
,,
7,11,"Alright, what's the worst that could happen,
"
,,
7,11,"this is the twenty first century, people are tolerant.
"
,,
7,11,"Well, this is nothing, probably just a random act of violence.
"
,,
7,11,"I thought only he without sin could cast the first Prius.
"
,,
7,11,"Huh, my God. That was a close one.
"
,,
7,11,"Brian, what happened?
"
,,
7,11,"I'm a pariah, Lois
"
,,
7,11,"Ever since Meg told everyone I'm an atheist
"
,,
7,11,"I'm the most hated person in town.
"
,,
7,11,"I try to rent a movie and they threw me out.
"
,,
7,11,"I try to buy a pack of cigarettes and they threw me out.
"
,,
7,11,"But the most serious part of it is no bar would serve me a drink!
"
,,
7,11,"Well if you ask me me, I think laying off the sauce could do you some good Brian.
"
,,
7,11,"Yeah, right. If you need me I'll be in the kitchen.
"
,,
7,11,"I hope he finds faith of some kind.
"
,,
7,11,"You know who doesn't have all this problems? Marmaduke.
"
,,
7,11,"All he does is eat pies off the high counter.
"
,,
7,11,"Next time around we're gonna get ourselves a big tall pie-eating dog, Lois
"
,,
7,11," Okay Peter.
"
,,
7,11," Or Howard Hughes. Let's get Howard Hughes!
"
,,
7,11,"Great, we have a game plan.
"
,,
7,11,"Hold it together, Brian, hold it together.
"
,,
7,11,"Come on! You know you want a drink.
"
,,
7,11,"Yeah, come on, Brian, drink us!
"
,,
7,11,"Come on, drink me! What are you waitng for?
"
,,
7,11,"Yeah you big silly arse. Just wrap your lips around me and take a big gulp.
"
,,
7,11,"Get to the chopper!
"
,,
7,11,"Alright, everybody got your bowling shoes, everybody got your balls.
"
,,
7,11,"I don't have my shoes.
"
,,
7,11," Jonathan, we were just up at the counter. Why didn't you get your shoes?
"
,,
7,11," I don't have my shoes either.
"
,,
7,11," What the hell? You need your shoes to bowl.
"
,,
7,11," Now, why exactly can I not wear my loafers?
"
,,
7,11," What is the danger there?
"
,,
7,11," Because, Patrick, because, Patrick!
"
,,
7,11," Those are the rules.
"
,,
7,11," Well I think it's just because they want another dollar fifty from me.
"
,,
7,11,"Alright, I'm putting our names in.
"
,,
7,11," Brent..
"
,,
7,11," No-no don't put Brent
"
,,
7,11," Put Rock Kickass
"
,,
7,11," I don't know how to change it, I already typed it in!
"
,,
7,11,"For mine put Dirk Diggler.
"
,,
7,11,"I'm not gonna put everyone with a fake name!
"
,,
7,11,"How do you wanna do the teams?
"
,,
7,11," How about the white guys against the black guys?
"
,,
7,11," Patrick, don't be an instigator.
"
,,
7,11," I have to pee.
"
,,
7,11," Brent, take Michael to the bathroom, please.
"
,,
7,11,"Okay.
"
,,
7,11,"Look at me! I've got girl boobs!
"
,,
7,11,"Hey Meg! Guess what?
"
,,
7,11,"I've seen the light.
"
,,
7,11," Really?
"
,,
7,11," Yes, hallelujah I believe in God. Lordy-lordy, I believe.
"
,,
7,11,"Brian, that's fantastic news!
"
,,
7,11,"I know, I know. Hey, you mind spreading the news around town, say
"
,,
7,11,"maybe down at the liquor store, maybe down at the Clam
"
,,
7,11,"Of course Brian, but first we have work to do.
"
,,
7,11,"God's work. And God will be happy that you're joining me.
"
,,
7,11,"Then I say let's celebrate the way they did in the bible.
"
,,
7,11,"With wine. Red wine. You know, like Jesus drank.
"
,,
7,11," Do you like the wine?
"
,,
7,11," Very much, what is it?
"
,,
7,11,"Take a guess.
"
,,
7,11,"I have to leave.
"
,,
7,11,"Naaah, sit down.
"
,,
7,11,"Thanks for setting everyone straight, Meg.
"
,,
7,11,"I feel the warm healing liquid presence of God's genuine cold filtered grace.
"
,,
7,11,"It was my pleasure Brian.
"
,,
7,11,"And now, we get to do the work of the Lord.
"
,,
7,11," Come on!
"
,,
7,11," What? What are we doing?
"
,,
7,11,"God's will Brian.
"
,,
7,11," A book burning?
"
,,
7,11," Come on! Grab an arm full!
"
,,
7,11,"We have to destroy everything that's harmful to God!
"
,,
7,11,"Meg, I can't be a part of this. And either should you.
"
,,
7,11,"What are you talking about? I thought you'd seen the light, Brian!
"
,,
7,11,"Well, to be honest I lied for booze, but Meg, you're a smart girl
"
,,
7,11,"You ought to be able see that what's going on here is wrong!
"
,,
7,11,"You are not gonna turn me from my faith, Brian!
"
,,
7,11,"Ok, fine. Then let me just ask you this.
"
,,
7,11,"If there were a God would he put you here on
"
,,
7,11,"Earth with a flat chest and a fat ass?
"
,,
7,11,"I'm made in his image?
"
,,
7,11," Really?
"
,,
7,11,"Would he give you a smoking hot mom like Lois
"
,,
7,11,"and then have you grow up looking like Peter?
"
,,
7,11,"Well..
"
,,
7,11,"And what kind of God would put you in a house where
"
,,
7,11,"no one respects or cares about you?
"
,,
7,11,"Not even enough to get you a damn mumps shot!
"
,,
7,11,"Oh, no!
"
,,
7,11,"You're right, Brian! You're right!
"
,,
7,11,"I'm sorry Meg.
"
,,
7,11,"But what is there to believe in without God?
"
,,
7,11,"Where do the answers come from?
"
,,
7,11,"Oh that's all part of the human experience. It's what we're here to find out.
"
,,
7,11,"And I bet you that the real answer to the nature of our existence
"
,,
7,11,"is gonna be more unimaginably amazing than we can possibly conceive.
"
,,
7,11,"Rob?
"
,,
7,11,"Did you hear that?
"
,,
7,11,"Hear what?
"
,,
7,11,"I swear I heard something.
"
,,
7,11,"There is nothing under your bed.
"
,,
7,11,"There is nothing in the closet.
"
,,
7,11,"There are no such things as monsters.
"
,,
7,11,"Alright?
"
,,
7,11," Alright I guess.
"
,,
7,11," Good.
"
,,
7,11,"Now, try to go to sleep, cause we gotta get up in the morning and make movies.
"
,,
7,11,"We're big Hollywood actors.
"
,,
7,11,"Yeah we are!
"
,,
7,11,"This was exhausting.
"
,,
7,11,"This whole experience was absolutely exhausting.
"
,,
7,11,"You people have ruined ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" for me
"
,,
7,11,"You are absolutely the most insufferable group of jackasses I've
"
,,
7,11,"ever had the misfortune of spending an extended period of time with.
"
,,
7,11,"I hope you all fucking die.
"
,,
7,11,"I still have five prize tickets from the carnival.
"
,,
7,11,"There was nothing for five tickets, we've been over this!
"
,,
7,11,"Well, but LeVar and I were going to pool ours for the Fuzzy Troll pencil topper
"
,,
7,11," Oh, yeah? You gonna share that?
"
,,
7,11," Yeah, we were gonna share it!
"
,,
7,11," Really? How's that gonna work?
"
,,
7,11," Three days at my house, three days at LeVar's and alternating sundays.
"
,,
7,11,"For a pencil topper?
"
,,
7,11," I have to pee again.
"
,,
7,11," That's it. Goodbye.
"
,,
7,12,"Hey Quagmire.
"
,,
7,12,"Peter, I want you
"
,,
7,12,"and the guys to come
"
,,
7,12,"over to my house right now.
"
,,
7,12,"We're drinking. What for?
"
,,
7,12,"Just come over.
"
,,
7,12,"I want you to see something.
"
,,
7,12,"Alright.
"
,,
7,12,"C'mon guys, we're going to Quagmire's.
"
,,
7,12,"Alright, hang on. I gotta
"
,,
7,12,"go to the bathroom first.
"
,,
7,12,"OK, let's go.
"
,,
7,12,"Oh, finally!
"
,,
7,12,"C'mon, c'mon. C'mon inside.
"
,,
7,12,"Well, what is it?
"
,,
7,12,"What's the big damn deal?
"
,,
7,12,"Look.
"
,,
7,12,"It's a cat.
"
,,
7,12,"Yeah, I just got him today.
"
,,
7,12,"His name's James.
"
,,
7,12,"Isn't he just the cutest
"
,,
7,12,"thing you've ever seen?
"
,,
7,12,"Hi, James.
"
,,
7,12,"Oh my God!
"
,,
7,12,"Watch when I scratch his
"
,,
7,12,"bottom. He sticks his fanny in the air.
"
,,
7,12,"Oh, oh. We have
"
,,
7,12,"lift off. We have lift off.
"
,,
7,12,"Oh, come here, James.
"
,,
7,12,"What the hell we doin'.
"
,,
7,12,"Quagmire, since when do you like cats?
"
,,
7,12,"Since I found this little
"
,,
7,12,"guy living under my house.
"
,,
7,12,"I'll tell you this ...
"
,,
7,12,"I understand now why the
"
,,
7,12,"pharoahs worshipped these animals.
"
,,
7,12,"Oh look, Joe. He's making friends.
"
,,
7,12,"Oh, sorry.
"
,,
7,12,"Y'know ... y'know what?
"
,,
7,12,"It's alright, Quagmire
"
,,
7,12,"That leg is mostly pus.
"
,,
7,12,"Oh, OK.
"
,,
7,12,"Here it comes, James.
"
,,
7,12,"Here comes the part
"
,,
7,12,"I was telling you about.
"
,,
7,12,"Aaaaah! You're one of those.
"
,,
7,12,"I hate Quagmire lately.
"
,,
7,12,"Me too.
"
,,
7,12,"That cat has totally
"
,,
7,12,"changed his personality.
"
,,
7,12,"Yeah, like when I went
"
,,
7,12,"over to his house the other day.
"
,,
7,12,"Who is it?
"
,,
7,12,"It's me, Quagmire. I need
"
,,
7,12,"to borrow your lawnmower.
"
,,
7,12,"Oh, Quagmire's not
"
,,
7,12,"here It's just me, James.
"
,,
7,12,"I'm supposed to watch the house.
"
,,
7,12,"C'mon, Quagmire. It's 97 out here.
"
,,
7,12,"We're 2 grown men.
"
,,
7,12,"Are you selling yarn? 'Cos I love yarn.
"
,,
7,12,"No, I need to borrow your lawnmower.
"
,,
7,12,"Oh, I don't think
"
,,
7,12,"Quagmire wants me to do that.
"
,,
7,12,"Oh, come on!
"
,,
7,12,"I don't think Quagmire appreciated
"
,,
7,12,"the condition you returned it in last time.
"
,,
7,12,"Glenn, can I just ...
"
,,
7,12,"No, you can't have it.
"
,,
7,12,"Hey guys, it's James' birthday tomorrow.
"
,,
7,12,"Would you all sign his card?
"
,,
7,12,"You want us to sign a card for your cat?
"
,,
7,12,"Yeah. Don't just put your
"
,,
7,12,"name, write something clever.
"
,,
7,12,"God, I hate having to come
"
,,
7,12,"up with something on the spot.
"
,,
7,12,"Ummm.
"
,,
7,12,"Have a 'mice' day.
"
,,
7,12,"Best fishes.
"
,,
7,12,"Peter.
"
,,
7,12,"Thanks ...... that's great.
"
,,
7,12,"Well, I gotta get going.
"
,,
7,12,"I'm heading off to Vermont
"
,,
7,12,"to get James' birthday present.
"
,,
7,12,"There's this neat little store called ""Cattitudes""
"
,,
7,12,"that makes all this neat cat stuff.
"
,,
7,12,"See you guys later.
"
,,
7,12,"What a queer.
"
,,
7,12,"He's goin' all the way to
"
,,
7,12,"Vermont for cat gifts and what-not?
"
,,
7,12,"You can get a scratcing post down at Wal Mart for $2.00
"
,,
7,12,"A pair of Lee jeans for $9.00
"
,,
7,12,"Y'know they got seats for children
"
,,
7,12,"now? You put 'em right in your car.
"
,,
7,12,"Supposed to make 'em safer.
"
,,
7,12,"Only problem is, you can't lean
"
,,
7,12,"your seat all the way back ... oh.
"
,,
7,12,"We gotta do somethin' about this.
"
,,
7,12,"His whole life is about that stupid cat.
"
,,
7,12,"Hey, y'know the cat's
"
,,
7,12,"alone at Quagmire's right now.
"
,,
7,12,"Y'know what we should do?
"
,,
7,12,"We should go over there and shave it.
"
,,
7,12,"That's a great idea!
"
,,
7,12,"Let's do it!
"
,,
7,12,"Let's shave the cat!
"
,,
7,12,"Oh boy, I usually only get this excited
"
,,
7,12,"when they say the title
"
,,
7,12,"of the movie in the movie.
"
,,
7,12,"I'm telling you
"
,,
7,12,"these drug dealers represent
"
,,
7,12,"a Clear and Present
"
,,
7,12,"Danger to the United States.
"
,,
7,12,"Eh? Eh? He said it. He said it.
"
,,
7,12,"All I'm sayin' is what
"
,,
7,12,"if this As Good As It Gets?
"
,,
7,12,"Eh? Eh? There it is! There it is!
"
,,
7,12,"The only way for me to solve
"
,,
7,12,"this crisis is to be Superman IV.
"
,,
7,12,"The Quest for Peace.
"
,,
7,12,"So that's why they call it that.
"
,,
7,12,"Alright, the cat's gotta be in here.
"
,,
7,12,"Hey, lets take a man-
"
,,
7,12,"sized poop in his cat box
"
,,
7,12,"so he thinks there's
"
,,
7,12,"something really wrong with him.
"
,,
7,12,"There it is!
"
,,
7,12,"Rock and roll!
"
,,
7,12,"Yeah! Shaving time!
"
,,
7,12,"Alright, hand me the razor.
"
,,
7,12,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
7,12,"Peter, you killed it!
"
,,
7,12,"Will you guys relax.
"
,,
7,12,"He's got 8 more lives.
"
,,
7,12,"OK, 7 more lives.
"
,,
7,12,"Peter, stop doin' what you're doin.
"
,,
7,12,"What'll we do?
"
,,
7,12,"Altight, alright. I have an idea.
"
,,
7,12,"How 'bout we hide the cat's
"
,,
7,12,"body and leave that window open
"
,,
7,12,"and that way, it'll
"
,,
7,12,"seem like the cat ran away.
"
,,
7,12,"We'll never get away with that.
"
,,
7,12,"Oh, we just might.
"
,,
7,12,"You see, I've got a lucky cat's foot.
"
,,
7,12,"Y'know, Peter, it's
"
,,
7,12,"sorta adding insult to injury
"
,,
7,12,"raiding Quagmire's fridge
"
,,
7,12,"for beer after you killed his cat.
"
,,
7,12,"Or is it?
"
,,
7,12,"Is my response.
"
,,
7,12,"Ah, crap!
"
,,
7,12,"God, I hate cops.
"
,,
7,12,"Almost as much as I hated
"
,,
7,12,"my overly sensitive car alarm.
"
,,
7,12,"Son of a bitch!
"
,,
7,12,"Whatta we got, partner?
"
,,
7,12,"Empty alcohol containers.
"
,,
7,12,"The driver's inebriated
"
,,
7,12,"and covered in blood.
"
,,
7,12,"He's got scratches
"
,,
7,12,"on his face and arms.
"
,,
7,12,"There's a blood soaked
"
,,
7,12,"corpse in the back seat.
"
,,
7,12,"He's got shovels in there,
"
,,
7,12,"and a hand drawn map titled
"
,,
7,12,"""This is where we'll hide the body.""
"
,,
7,12,"Well, that all seems fine.
"
,,
7,12,"Sorry to bother you. sir.
"
,,
7,12,"Pot! Small amount of pot!
"
,,
7,12,"You're under arrest, dirtbag!
"
,,
7,12,"Oh, come on!
"
,,
7,12,"I don't appreciate
"
,,
7,12,"drug addicts in my town!
"
,,
7,12,"I'm a family guy.
"
,,
7,12,"Eh? Eh? He said it.
"
,,
7,12,"Alright, Brian, your
"
,,
7,12,"family's here to bail you out.
"
,,
7,12,"Brian, if you don't mind,
"
,,
7,12,"we'll start thinkin' up our
"
,,
7,12,"prison rape jokes immediately.
"
,,
7,12,"I'll break the ice.
"
,,
7,12,"Hey, Brian, did you do
"
,,
7,12,"'Hard Time' or 'Hardly Working?'
"
,,
7,12,"Penis.
"
,,
7,12,"Alright, well all the pieces are there.
"
,,
7,12,"Somebody make somethin' outta that.
"
,,
7,12,"Hey, Brian, who's your
"
,,
7,12,"favorite baseball player?
"
,,
7,12,"Albert Pujols?
"
,,
7,12,"Chris, stop it! Come on.
"
,,
7,12,"Brian, we're happy you're out of jail.
"
,,
7,12,"And when we get to the car
"
,,
7,12,"would you like a donut to sit on?
"
,,
7,12,"Ha ha ha. Y'see, I'm part of it.
"
,,
7,12,"I'm part of it like everyone else.
"
,,
7,12,"I can't believe they threw me
"
,,
7,12,"in jail for a quarter ounce of pot.
"
,,
7,12,"Well, Brian, it's your own fault.
"
,,
7,12,"I mean, pot is illegal for a reason.
"
,,
7,12,"Lois, don't be a hypocrite.
"
,,
7,12,"You've smoked pot.
"
,,
7,12,"Well sure, Brian,
"
,,
7,12,"but I'm thinkin' about the children.
"
,,
7,12,"Pot's illegal mainly to protect them.
"
,,
7,12,"No, no. Pot is illegal
"
,,
7,12,"because William Randolph Hearst
"
,,
7,12,"ran a smear campaign
"
,,
7,12,"against marijuana in the 1930's
"
,,
7,12,"to protect his interests
"
,,
7,12,"in the timber industry
"
,,
7,12,"because hemp was
"
,,
7,12,"poised to replace wood
"
,,
7,12,"as an inexpensive raw material
"
,,
7,12,"for the manufacture of paper.
"
,,
7,12,"There's your smear
"
,,
7,12,"campaign right there, Brian.
"
,,
7,12,"Ah-ha-ha.
"
,,
7,12,"Mom's right.
"
,,
7,12,"Drugs are bad, Brian.
"
,,
7,12,"I mean, haven't you
"
,,
7,12,"seen those commercials?
"
,,
7,12,"Open up, Brian, it's Joe.
"
,,
7,12,"Crap!
"
,,
7,12,"Uh, uh, j-just a sec.
"
,,
7,12,"Brian, under your probation
"
,,
7,12,"you're required to
"
,,
7,12,"submit to random drug tests.
"
,,
7,12,"I need some urine.
"
,,
7,12,"You mean .... right now?
"
,,
7,12,"Yes. Right now.
"
,,
7,12,"Here's some
"
,,
7,12,"magazines to get you going.
"
,,
7,12,"Uh, how's that gonna ... ?
"
,,
7,12,"Oh, sorry. It's been a while.
"
,,
7,12,"Look, I don't really feel
"
,,
7,12,"comfortable doing this in front of you.
"
,,
7,12,"Fine, I'll wait outside.
"
,,
7,12,"Here's a bottle of lotion.
"
,,
7,12,"Aah, Joe ...
"
,,
7,12,"Right. Sorry.
"
,,
7,12,"Stewie, I need your urine.
"
,,
7,12,"Huh ... Really?
"
,,
7,12,"Yeah. Joe's doing a drug test
"
,,
7,12,"and if I give him some of mine
"
,,
7,12,"he's gonna know
"
,,
7,12,"I've been smoking pot
"
,,
7,12,"so I need some
"
,,
7,12,"of your urine so I can ...
"
,,
7,12,"Uh ... you don't have
"
,,
7,12,"to be naked for this.
"
,,
7,12,"But I don't have to NOT
"
,,
7,12,"be naked for it, either. Ah-ha ...
"
,,
7,12,"Come on, Stewie,
"
,,
7,12,"hurry up and pee.
"
,,
7,12,"Joe's waiting for me.
"
,,
7,12,"Brian, you know I
"
,,
7,12,"can't go unless you stare at it.
"
,,
7,12,"Brian, what the hell ... ?
"
,,
7,12,"Uhh ... hey, Lois
"
,,
7,12,"The jig's up, Brian.
"
,,
7,12,"Run!
"
,,
7,12,"Brian, is this how you're
"
,,
7,12,"trying to pass your drug test?
"
,,
7,12,"By stealing a baby's urine?
"
,,
7,12,"My God, that is just sick!
"
,,
7,12,"No, what's sick is
"
,,
7,12,"making marijuana illegal
"
,,
7,12,"when it's been proven that it
"
,,
7,12,"does less damage to you than alcohol.
"
,,
7,12,"No, what's sick is the
"
,,
7,12,"plot of the movie ""Baby Mama.""
"
,,
7,12,"What happens when
"
,,
7,12,"a 40 year old woman
"
,,
7,12,"asks her 41 year old
"
,,
7,12,"friend to carry her baby?
"
,,
7,12,"Push, Angie, push harder ...
"
,,
7,12,"Oh, it's dead.
"
,,
7,12,"Brian, when you
"
,,
7,12,"have to go to these lengths
"
,,
7,12,"just to get away with smoking pot
"
,,
7,12,"it's time to make a change.
"
,,
7,12,"You're right, Lois.
"
,,
7,12,"It is time to make a change.
"
,,
7,12,"Thank you.
"
,,
7,12,"It's time for Quahog
"
,,
7,12,"to legalize marijuana!
"
,,
7,12,"But that's not exactly what I meant.
"
,,
7,12,"Hey, check out
"
,,
7,12,"the size of Stewie's penis.
"
,,
7,12,"Oh, come on guys,
"
,,
7,12,"it's just the way God made me.
"
,,
7,12,"No more oppression!
"
,,
7,12,"We, as American adults with free will
"
,,
7,12,"have the right to
"
,,
7,12,"use marijuana if we choose to!
"
,,
7,12,"Enough government profiteering
"
,,
7,12,"under the guise of morality!
"
,,
7,12,"Enough with this phony war on drugs!
"
,,
7,12,"You know, you're going
"
,,
7,12,"about this all wrong, Brian.
"
,,
7,12,"If you want to win people over,
"
,,
7,12,"you can't just drone on like Ben Stein.
"
,,
7,12,"You've got to have a
"
,,
7,12,"little more showmanship.
"
,,
7,12,"Here, watch.
"
,,
7,12,"# Now everybody

7,12,"gather round #

7,12,"# and listen if you would #

"

7,12,"They rent ""The Rocketeer.""
"
,,
7,12,"He humps a guy like me
"
,,
7,12,"Right!
"

7,12,"# but all we need

"
,,
7,12,"Good evening everyone.
"
,,
7,12,"Our top story:
"
,,
7,12,"""Marijuana is now legal""
"
,,
7,12,"Le..le... is now legal.
"
,,
7,12,"Legal in Quahog
"
,,
7,12,"And it's made everything ...
"
,,
7,12,"... just so great.
"
,,
7,12,"OK, you ... you can
"
,,
7,12,"read the next one.
"
,,
7,12,"No, you can.
"
,,
7,12,"No, you.
"
,,
7,12,"OK, OK, OK.
"
,,
7,12,"L..let..let's read it both together.
"
,,
7,12," Ready?
"
,,
7,12," OK ... OK
"
,,
7,12,"Here's Ollie Williams with
"
,,
7,12,"the black you weather forecast.
"
,,
7,12,"How's the weather look, Ollie?
"
,,
7,12,"Not too bad.
"
,,
7,12,"Right on!
"
,,
7,12,"See Lois?
"
,,
7,12,"Tell me things in
"
,,
7,12,"Quahog aren't better now.
"
,,
7,12,"It's just weird, Brian.
"
,,
7,12,"I still don't think I'm
"
,,
7,12,"comfortable with the whole idea.
"
,,
7,12,"Look Lois, ever since
"
,,
7,12,"marijuana was legalized ...
"
,,
7,12,"... crime has gone down,
"
,,
7,12,"productivity is up,
"
,,
7,12,"and ratings forl Dr. Who
"
,,
7,12,"are through the roof.
"
,,
7,12,"Yeah, but Peter's so vague lately
"
,,
7,12,"he can hardly set up a cut away.
"
,,
7,12,"Man, this is even better than ...
"
,,
7,12,"Uh, no, wait ...
"
,,
7,12,"No, this is worse than ...
"
,,
7,12,"Thi ... Ah, better ...
"
,,
7,12,"I dunno.
"
,,
7,12,"Here's a list of
"
,,
7,12,"celebrities I don't like:
"
,,
7,12,"Hello, Griffin
"
,,
7,12,"Mr Pewterschmidt?
"
,,
7,12," Hey, how ya been?
"
,,
7,12," Not good.
"
,,
7,12,"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
"
,,
7,12,"Wow, a limo, huh?
"
,,
7,12,"Hey, are these
"
,,
7,12,"Diet Rites just to take?
"
,,
7,12,"No!
"
,,
7,12,"Those are my Diet Rites!
"
,,
7,12,"Now listen, Griffin.
"
,,
7,12,"Thanks to your dog's
"
,,
7,12,"stupid marijuana crusade,
"
,,
7,12,"people are using hemp for everything.
"
,,
7,12,"Fabric, fuel ... and paper.
"
,,
7,12,"Which means I'm
"
,,
7,12,"losing billions in timber dollars.
"
,,
7,12,"I had to sell my Bangles records.
"
,,
7,12,"I was still working on
"
,,
7,12,"memorizing all the words.
"
,,
7,12,"My back is hurting
"
,,
7,12,"from the chair I'm sitting on.
"
,,
7,12,"Where's the Tylenol?
"
,,
7,12,"If I lay down flat on the floor
"
,,
7,12,"It usually kinda fixes it.
"
,,
7,12,"Tony Danza
"
,,
7,12,"from Who's the Boss says
"
,,
7,12,"Eh-oh ... Eh-oh ...
"
,,
7,12,"Oh-eh .. oh-eh-ohhhhh ...
"
,,
7,12,"I'm losing money,
"
,,
7,12,"and it's your dog's fault.
"
,,
7,12,"Now, I have to get
"
,,
7,12,"hemp illegalized again.
"
,,
7,12,"And the only way to do that
"
,,
7,12,"is to start a fear campaign
"
,,
7,12,"designed to turn people against pot.
"
,,
7,12,"Will you help me?
"
,,
7,12,"Gosh, Mr. Pewterschmidt
"
,,
7,12,"I .. I could never go
"
,,
7,12,"against Brian like that.
"
,,
7,12,"I'll give you this
"
,,
7,12,"light up butterfly yo-yo.
"
,,
7,12," Ohhh, to keep?
"
,,
7,12," Not to keep!
"
,,
7,12,"You can use it today, and
"
,,
7,12,"one more day in the summer.
"
,,
7,12," Yeah!
"
,,
7,12," Pull over.
"
,,
7,12,"Bye.
"
,,
7,12,"Alright, Carter
"
,,
7,12,"I've finished cutting
"
,,
7,12,"together our anti-pot video.
"
,,
7,12,"Take a look.
"
,,
7,12,"Hey, I got a great idea.
"
,,
7,12,"Let's kill 6 million Jews.
"
,,
7,12,"Hooray! Yeah!
"
,,
7,12,"Yeah, I'm on board.
"
,,
7,12,"How did you come up with that?
"
,,
7,12,"I got the idea ...
"
,,
7,12,"from ... from ... while ...
"
,,
7,12,"... from while I was smoking pot.
"
,,
7,12,"Anyone else who likes
"
,,
7,12,"pot, reach for my joint.
"
,,
7,12,"Oh, there it is.
"
,,
7,12,"Give us some of that.
"
,,
7,12,"Ha  ha  ha, perhaps later.
"
,,
7,12,"Now let's go to France and steal
"
,,
7,12,"all their objects ... de... arte ...
"
,,
7,12,"Yay! Alright! Let's go to France!
"
,,
7,12," Not bad, uh?
"
,,
7,12," Ah, damn it.
"
,,
7,12,"That was FOX News.
"
,,
7,12,"Apparently they own
"
,,
7,12,"the rights to Hitler's likeness
"
,,
7,12,"and they won't
"
,,
7,12,"have him slandered.
"
,,
7,12,"Hi, I'm Peter.
"
,,
7,12,"You know me from the movie
"
,,
7,12,"""Harold, Kumar and
"
,,
7,12,"Peter go to White Castle""
"
,,
7,12,"As you can see, I'm
"
,,
7,12,"enjoying a White Castle burger.
"
,,
7,12,"Why?
"
,,
7,12,"Because I don't do drugs.
"
,,
7,12,"It took me 5 minutes
"
,,
7,12,"to get to White Castle.
"
,,
7,12,"I didn't get diverted
"
,,
7,12,"by all those crazy hijinks.
"
,,
7,12,"'Cos I don't get high.
"
,,
7,12,"It was a good movie, though.
"
,,
7,12,"Y'know, Neil Patrick Harris
"
,,
7,12,"got the job on ""How I Met Your
"
,,
7,12,"Mother"" 'cos of that movie?
"
,,
7,12,"Y'know, I've only
"
,,
7,12,"seen that show once
"
,,
7,12,"but I gotta tell ya,
"
,,
7,12," what's really weird to me
"
,,
7,12,"is why is the voice of the
"
,,
7,12,"guy from the future, Bob Saget?
"
,,
7,12,"I mean, the guy on the show
"
,,
7,12,"... he's already an adult.
"
,,
7,12,"Y'know, so it's not like he's
"
,,
7,12,"gonna grow in to Bob Saget.
"
,,
7,12,"Doesn't make sense.
"
,,
7,12,"Thank you for your time.
"
,,
7,12,"Well, what do you think?
"
,,
7,12,"Look, daddy, I agree with
"
,,
7,12,"what you're trying to do,
"
,,
7,12,"but I just don't
"
,,
7,12,"think this is gonna work.
"
,,
7,12,"It's so artificial.
"
,,
7,12,"You're asking for
"
,,
7,12,"a spanking, young lady.
"
,,
7,12,"Yeah!
"
,,
7,12,"All right!
"
,,
7,12,"Peter, the reason
"
,,
7,12,"Brian succeeded in his cause
"
,,
7,12,"is that he spoke with such passion.
"
,,
7,12,"No offence,
"
,,
7,12,"but you two just
"
,,
7,12,"don't have that talent.
"
,,
7,12,"Are you kiddin'?
"
,,
7,12,"I can be very persuasive.
"
,,
7,12,"That's how I used
"
,,
7,12,"to lure wayward sailors
"
,,
7,12,"to their deaths with my Siren song.
"
,,
7,12,"Hello, Brian.
"
,,
7,12,"You're looking good.
"
,,
7,12,"Nice shiny coat.
"
,,
7,12,"Don't try to butter me up, Carter.
"
,,
7,12,"Why did you call me here?
"
,,
7,12,"Come inside.
"
,,
7,12,"There's something
"
,,
7,12,"I want to show you.
"
,,
7,12,"What's this?
"
,,
7,12,"It's your novel, Brian,
"
,,
7,12,"""Faster than the speed of Love""
"
,,
7,12,"Ready to ship out tomorrow.
"
,,
7,12,"All you have to do is
"
,,
7,12,"publicly come out against pot.
"
,,
7,12,"Forget it, Carter
"
,,
7,12,"I'm not gonna take your bribe.
"
,,
7,12,"I don't care if
"
,,
7,12,"you printed a million copies.
"
,,
7,12,"I printed TWO million.
"
,,
7,12,"And I even commissioned an oil
"
,,
7,12,"painting for your author's photo.
"
,,
7,12,"And what's this?
"
,,
7,12,"Is this an Oprah Book Club sticker?
"
,,
7,12,"I think it is.
"
,,
7,12,"Wait! Really?
"
,,
7,12,"Oh, my God.
"
,,
7,12,"Plus I can get you a
"
,,
7,12,"night in bed with Oprah.
"
,,
7,12," Eeerrrr ......?
"
,,
7,12," OK, just the sticker then.
"
,,
7,12,"So whatta you say?
"
,,
7,12,"Is it a deal?
"
,,
7,12,"You don't have to
"
,,
7,12,"sell out like this, Brian
"
,,
7,12,"Your novel .. is good enough .. to
"
,,
7,12,"be published .. on it's own .. merits
"
,,
7,12,"You think so?
"
,,
7,12,"Yeah, you bet.
"
,,
7,12,"This is your shot, Brian
"
,,
7,12,"You can be a superstar author.
"
,,
7,12,"All you gotta do is make an
"
,,
7,12,"impassioned anti-pot speech in public.
"
,,
7,12,"Forget it, Carter
"
,,
7,12,"Even Stewie says the
"
,,
7,12,"book is good enough on its own.
"
,,
7,12,"Right, Stewie?
"
,,
7,12,"... Ermmm ... maybe do
"
,,
7,12,"a song about why pot is bad.
"
,,
7,12,"# And that's why pot is bad #
"
,,
7,12,"I've heard all I need
"
,,
7,12,"to make an informed decision.
"
,,
7,12,"Marijuana is hereby re-illegalized.
"
,,
7,12,"In other news,
"
,,
7,12,"a local Quahog author
"
,,
7,12,"has set a record for the
"
,,
7,12,"worst selling novel of all time.
"
,,
7,12,"Brian Griffin's ""Faster
"
,,
7,12,"than the speed of Love""
"
,,
7,12," has astonishingly
"
,,
7,12,"not sold a single copy
"
,,
7,12,"thanks to universal
"
,,
7,12,"panning by literary critics.
"
,,
7,12,"Coming up, children
"
,,
7,12,"are getting sexier ...
"
,,
7,12,"and that's ...
"
,,
7,12,"... that's pretty cool.
"
,,
7,12,"This is so humiliating.
"
,,
7,12,"I sold out everything I believed in,
"
,,
7,12,"and I have nothing to show for it.
"
,,
7,12,"My book's a bomb!
"
,,
7,12,"Well, look at it this way ....
"
,,
7,12,"you did accomplish something.
"
,,
7,12,"Marijuana's illegal because of you,
"
,,
7,12,"and Stewie got
"
,,
7,12,"to build a nice little fort
"
,,
7,12,"with all of your unsold books.
"
,,
7,12,"My house is made of mediocrity.
"
,,
7,12,"Hey, guys.
"
,,
7,12,"I want you to know I'm
"
,,
7,12,"raising my reward to 50 dollars
"
,,
7,12,"for anyone who can
"
,,
7,12,"help me find James.
"
,,
7,12,"No questions asked.
"
,,
7,12,"I killed your cat.
"
,,
7,13,"Oh, Joe, thank you so much
"
,,
7,13,"for  inviting us to your barbeque.
"
,,
7,13,"Well, it's my pleasure, Lois.
"
,,
7,13,"Hey, can one of you
"
,,
7,13,"weathermen come over here
"
,,
7,13,"and comment on the
"
,,
7,13,"meat while I'm cookin' it?
"
,,
7,13,"Yeah, I got it.
"
,,
7,13,"Oh, yeah. Oh,
"
,,
7,13,"those are lookin' good.
"
,,
7,13,"Yeah, that's
"
,,
7,13,"what I'm talkin' about.
"
,,
7,13,"Yeah, don't flip 'em
"
,,
7,13,"too often, now. You
"
,,
7,13,"don't wanna lose the juices.
"
,,
7,13,"Yeah, yeah. Comin' along nicely.
"
,,
7,13,"Oh, those are cookin' just fine.
"
,,
7,13,"Scoop that one up and put it
"
,,
7,13,"back down in the exact same spot.
"
,,
7,13,"Alright, they're done! Time to eat!
"
,,
7,13,"Oh boy! I'm so
"
,,
7,13,"hungry, I could eat a horse.
"
,,
7,13,"I ... errr ... I mis-spoke.
"
,,
7,13,"Wow, Bonnie, you really took
"
,,
7,13,"off the baby weight quickly.
"
,,
7,13,"Oh, thanks, Lois
"
,,
7,13,"Hey, do mind rubbing some
"
,,
7,13,"of that sun-block on my back?
"
,,
7,13,"Of course, Bonnie.
"
,,
7,13,"Ooh, but I don't
"
,,
7,13,"wanna get any on my shirt.
"
,,
7,13,"Mmm ... that feels good.
"
,,
7,13,"Um, you're going
"
,,
7,13,"a little low there, Lois
"
,,
7,13,"Ah-ha ha, ok, I'm sorry.
"
,,
7,13,"Giggety!
"
,,
7,13,"Ah, Joe, Susie's such a cute baby.
"
,,
7,13,"Hey, whatever
"
,,
7,13,"happened to your son, Kevin?
"
,,
7,13,"He died in Iraq.
"
,,
7,13,"Sad.
"
,,
7,13,"I won't let you walk out
"
,,
7,13,"of here without that dress.
"
,,
7,13,"Oh, I don't know ...
"
,,
7,13," Will I ever wear it?
"
,,
7,13," Yes you will.
"
,,
7,13,"You've got that thing for the
"
,,
7,13,"opening of the library next week.
"
,,
7,13,"It's perfect for that.
"
,,
7,13,"Hey, everybody!
"
,,
7,13,"Oh, look, it's Black Barbie!
"
,,
7,13,"And why are you all alone?
"
,,
7,13,"Oh, they
"
,,
7,13,"discontinued my boyfriend.
"
,,
7,13,"Mom says I'm the one
"
,,
7,13,"who's hair it's OK to cut.
"
,,
7,13,"Hey! I was playing with that!
"
,,
7,13,"Hey, come back here!
"
,,
7,13,"Alright, you asked for it.
"
,,
7,13,"Holy crap!
"
,,
7,13,"Alright, let's try that one again.
"
,,
7,13,"Oh, my God, Stewie!
"
,,
7,13,"Ha! Your kid got
"
,,
7,13,"beat up by a baby girl.
"
,,
7,13,"Oh man, this is more painful
"
,,
7,13,"to watch than when Family Ties
"
,,
7,13,"does a Tina Yothers episode.
"
,,
7,13,"Jennifer, What
"
,,
7,13,"happened in school today?
"
,,
7,13,"I got my period!
"
,,
7,13,"And I will see the
"
,,
7,13,"Keaton family next week.
"
,,
7,13,"Ok, now, sweetie.
"
,,
7,13,"This isn't gonna hurt at all.
"
,,
7,13,"Aaahh! Those lying bastards
"
,,
7,13,"at Johnson and Johnson!
"
,,
7,13,"We'll put ""No More
"
,,
7,13,"Tears"" on the label.
"
,,
7,13," But, it does make you cry.
"
,,
7,13," I know.
"
,,
7,13,"Heh heh heh! Ah hah! Ha ha.
"
,,
7,13,"Ha-ha-ha-ha. Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
"
,,
7,13,"Lois, you should just let
"
,,
7,13,"those wounds get infected.
"
,,
7,13,"It'll teach him a
"
,,
7,13,"lesson about being tough.
"
,,
7,13,"Peter, he's just a baby.
"
,,
7,13,"You gotta let this go.
"
,,
7,13,"My baby boy got beat up by a girl!
"
,,
7,13,"What was weird,
"
,,
7,13,"was that she was crying ...
"
,,
7,13,"... but the way she
"
,,
7,13,"was standing over me,
"
,,
7,13,"made it look like I was crying.
"
,,
7,13,"Which was weird.
"
,,
7,13,"Peter, what exactly are you worried
"
,,
7,13,"is gonna happen because of this?
"
,,
7,13,"World War 5!
"
,,
7,13,"Peter, we've been over this ...
"
,,
7,13,"There has to be a
"
,,
7,13,"World War 3 and 4 first.
"
,,
7,13,"Oh, no. Oh, no
"
,,
7,13,"That's the beauty
"
,,
7,13,"of World War 5, Lois.
"
,,
7,13,"It's so intense, it
"
,,
7,13,"skips over the other two.
"
,,
7,13,"Peter, it doesn't work ...
"
,,
7,13,"I have spoken!
"
,,
7,13,"Huuh! There's Connie D'Amico
"
,,
7,13,"Chris, don't walk next to me.
"
,,
7,13,"Hi, Connie.
"
,,
7,13,"Uh, so, I heard you talking
"
,,
7,13,"in the hall the other day
"
,,
7,13,"about how much you
"
,,
7,13,"liked High School Musical 2,
"
,,
7,13,"so I burned you the soundtrack.
"
,,
7,13,"OK, prepare for itemised insults.
"
,,
7,13,"A: Don't ever listen to me talk.
"
,,
7,13,"You don't deserve my words.
"
,,
7,13,"B: When I said I enjoyed
"
,,
7,13,"it, I was speaking ironically.
"
,,
7,13,"And ... C: You actually
"
,,
7,13,"liked High School Musical?
"
,,
7,13,"What are you, 8?
"
,,
7,13,"No, that's impossible,
"
,,
7,13,"because I've seen that big
"
,,
7,13,"hairy mud flap arse of
"
,,
7,13,"yours in the locker room.
"
,,
7,13,"Questions?
"
,,
7,13,"Hey, Meg, take that!
"
,,
7,13,"Ha ha. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha.
"
,,
7,13,"That was awesome!
"
,,
7,13,"The joke's kind of on us,
"
,,
7,13,"'cos we're smellin' it.
"
,,
7,13," Yeah!
"
,,
7,13," Awesome!
"
,,
7,13,"Oh, way to go, folks!
"
,,
7,13,"Ugh! Scott is such an idiot!
"
,,
7,13,"I'm totally breaking up with him.
"
,,
7,13,"I'm gonna switch to one
"
,,
7,13,"of the other popular guys.
"
,,
7,13,"But Connie, you've
"
,,
7,13,"gone out with, like, every
"
,,
7,13,"popular boy in this school.
"
,,
7,13,"Ah, yeah, you're right!
"
,,
7,13,"God, they all suck so much!
"
,,
7,13,"I need a new challenge.
"
,,
7,13,"What if ... wait, now
"
,,
7,13,"bear with me on this ...
"
,,
7,13,"What if I date a loser and make
"
,,
7,13,"him over into a popular guy?
"
,,
7,13,"Wow, great idea!
"
,,
7,13,"I'm glad I hung in there.
"
,,
7,13,"Now, who are the
"
,,
7,13,"biggest losers in this school?
"
,,
7,13,"Well, there's Smiley McGee.
"
,,
7,13,"Hello!
"
,,
7,13,"Nah. I hear he's a bed wetter.
"
,,
7,13,"And ... Chris Griffin
"
,,
7,13,"Oh, my God! I could
"
,,
7,13,"smell him from here.
"
,,
7,13,"He's perfect.
"
,,
7,13,"God, you're right!
"
,,
7,13,"He smells like Fred Flinstone's arse!
"
,,
7,13,"Hey! No-one's askin' you to smell it.
"
,,
7,13,"Alright, Stewie, your dad's gonna
"
,,
7,13,"help you learn how to be a man.
"
,,
7,13,"Real men have a couple of beers,
"
,,
7,13,"and then project their
"
,,
7,13,"inadequacies on their kids.
"
,,
7,13," OK.
"
,,
7,13," What's that?
"
,,
7,13,"You think you're better than me?
"
,,
7,13,"What? No, I didn't say that.
"
,,
7,13,"So I guess you
"
,,
7,13,"think you woulda been some
"
,,
7,13,"sort of big shot by my age, huh?
"
,,
7,13,"Done things differently?
"
,,
7,13,"Gotten that promotion?
"
,,
7,13,"I don't even know what you do.
"
,,
7,13,"Well, let me tell you somethin' ...
"
,,
7,13,"You're nothin'! And you're
"
,,
7,13,"never gonna be nothin'!!!
"
,,
7,13,"Now, let's sit here
"
,,
7,13,"and watch Spike TV.
"
,,
7,13,"Wow, my favorite.
"
,,
7,13,"P B and J with the crust cut off.
"
,,
7,13,"What'd you get?
"
,,
7,13,"Your crusts.
"
,,
7,13,"That's it?
"
,,
7,13,"No, I also got an
"
,,
7,13,"orange peel and a picture
"

,,
7,13,"Thank you.
"
,,
7,13,"Chris Griffin,
"
,,
7,13,"you are undoubtedly the
"
,,
7,13,"most unpopular boy in school.
"
,,
7,13,"I am? What about
"
,,
7,13,"Smiley McGee over there?
"
,,
7,13,"Hello!
"
,,
7,13,"You and I are going
"
,,
7,13,"on a date Saturday night.
"
,,
7,13,"Um ... OK.
"
,,
7,13,"I'll see you then.
"
,,
7,13,"Why would she go out with me?
"
,,
7,13,"She must be more
"
,,
7,13,"drunk than  Santa Claus
"
,,
7,13,"when he got that D.U.I.
"
,,
7,13,"No, no, it wasn't my fault.
"
,,
7,13,"Some guy in a
"
,,
7,13,"Plymouth totally cut me off.
"
,,
7,13,"Sir, they don't
"
,,
7,13,"make Plymouths anymore.
"
,,
7,13,"Are you Jewish?
"
,,
7,13,"Sir, I'm gonna need
"
,,
7,13,"you to step outta the sleigh.
"
,,
7,13,"Alright, Stewie, we're gonna
"
,,
7,13,"get you nice and pumped up.

,,
7,13,"Now, you see

7,13,"Uh-oh, spadoody-O's!
"
,,
7,13,"I noticed your kid
"

7,13,"is having some trouble.
"
,,
7,13,"You're tellin' me.
"
,,
7,13,"Oh, your kid just
"
,,
7,13,"needs a little help.
"
,,
7,13,"I got something
"
,,
7,13,"that'll get him going.
"
,,
7,13,"Well, if there's anyone I can trust
"
,,
7,13,"it's a stranger at the
"
,,
7,13,"gym holding a dirty needle.
"
,,
7,13,"Here, Stewie, try this.
"
,,
7,13,"Yaah! What the
"
,,
7,13,"hell are you do .... ?
"
,,
7,13,"Whoa! Oh my ...
"
,,
7,13,"suddenly I'm full of energy.
"
,,
7,13,"Alright, fat man, let's do this!
"
,,
7,13,"Wow, Stewie, you

7,13,"Oh, my God!
"
,,
7,13,"What the hell happened to Stewie?
"
,,
7,13,"Yeah, looks good, doesn't he?
"
,,
7,13,"Let's see that lesbo Susie
"
,,
7,13,"Swanson beat him up now.
"
,,
7,13,"Wait a minute. How
"
,,
7,13,"do you know she's gay?
"
,,
7,13,"Short haircut, stubby legs,
"
,,
7,13,"doesn't respond to my advances.
"
,,
7,13,"You haven't answered my question!
"
,,
7,13,"Why the hell does
"
,,
7,13,"Stewie look like this?
"
,,
7,13,"Well, I took him to the gym and
"
,,
7,13,"the colorful gent there advised
"
,,
7,13,"me that I put him on steroids.
"
,,
7,13,"And you listened to him?!
"
,,
7,13,"Yeah, I believe everything
"

7,13,"everyone tells me, anywhere.

,,
7,13,"You look like Lou Ferrigno's poop.
"
,,
7,13,"I look like a guy who's
"
,,
7,13,"been hittin' the gym.
"
,,
7,13,"It has nothing to do with
"
,,
7,13,"the gym. You're on drugs.
"
,,
7,13,"Doesn't matter how you find
"
,,
7,13,"the pot o' gold, B to the rian
"
,,
7,13,"All that matters is that
"
,,
7,13,"you beat the leprechauns.
"
,,
7,13,"That doesn't make any sense.
"
,,
7,13,"Doesn't have to make
"
,,
7,13,"sense when you look like this.
"
,,
7,13,"Rrrrrr ... !!!
"
,,
7,13,"I am hotter than
"

"
,,
7,13,"You sound hot.
"
,,
7,13,"What are you wearing?
"
,,
7,13,"I dunno.

7,13,"Chris, turn that off.
"

7,13,"Alright, if I'm
"

7,13,"that mean when we go in there
"
,,
7,13,"I can hold your hand?
"
,,
7,13,"Good idea.
"
,,
7,13,"Then everyone will
"
,,
7,13,"think you're popular.
"
,,
7,13,"Well, I don't really care about that.
"
,,
7,13,"I want to hold

"
,,
7,13,"He needs to deliver this
"
,,
7,13,"message before the construction

,,
7,13,"site contracts are handed down.
"

7,13,"It's of vital importance that

7,13,"So we may have to bring
"

7,13,"No, Gina, I'm not.
"
,,
7,13," You're not?
"
,,
7,13," No.
"
,,
7,13,"There's something about him.
"
,,
7,13,"He's not like the other guys.
"
,,
7,13,"I actually really like him.
"
,,
7,13,"You do?
"
,,
7,13,"Yeah. In fact, I'm going to

"
,,
7,13,"Wow, Connie D'Amico's coming

"
,,
7,13,"I just hope dad
"
,,
7,13,"doesn't embarrass us,
"
,,
7,13,"like he did when that
"
,,
7,13,"one legged guy came over.
"
,,
7,13,"Alright, well, if
"
,,
7,13,"you like movie trivia,
"
,,
7,13,"I got one that'll stump you ...
"
,,
7,13,"Aaaaaaah ...
"
,,
7,13,"... course, you're probably
"
,,
7,13,"not really into tibia ... trivia
"
,,
7,13,"Aaaaah ...
"
,,
7,13,"Boy, that global warming, huh?
"
,,
7,13,"They say we lost a
"
,,
7,13,"foot of snow last winter ...
"
,,
7,13,"Hey, how 'bout another beer, huh?
"
,,
7,13,"I bet you like the taste of hops
"
,,
7,13,"... Aaaah ....
"
,,
7,13,"You only have one leg, sir.
"
,,
7,13,"Oh, Connie, it's so nice to meet you.
"
,,
7,13,"We're so excited that
"
,,
7,13,"Chris is finally bringing
"
,,
7,13,"a girl home for dinner.
"
,,
7,13,"It's really nice to
"
,,
7,13,"meet you too, Mrs Griffin.
"
,,
7,13,"Um, do you mind if I ask
"
,,
7,13,"what's up with your baby?
"
,,
7,13,"I'm gonna go work out.
"
,,
7,13,"Again? It's like
"
,,
7,13,"the eighth time today.
"
,,
7,13,"I'm not satisfied until every
"
,,
7,13,"vein is forced up against my skin.
"
,,
7,13,"Look how vascular I am, Brian.
"
,,
7,13,"If there's one thing women
"
,,
7,13," love, it's a vascular man.
"
,,
7,13,"blood all over my bahdy.</i>
"
,,
7,13,"That's how John Mayer would say it.
"
,,
7,13,"Bahdy

,,
7,13,"I'm really into him now.
"
,,
7,13,"You better be OK with it!
"
,,
7,13,"Well, to answer
"
,,
7,13,"your question, Connie,
"
,,
7,13,"apparently I'm married to a man
"
,,
7,13,"who thinks it's OK to
"
,,
7,13,"inject an infant with steroids.
"
,,
7,13,"Wait, Lois,
"
,,
7,13,"knock it off for a sec.
"
,,
7,13,"Connie, you are really pretty.
"
,,
7,13,"I mean, you have
"
,,
7,13,"filled out something wacky.
"
,,
7,13,"Oh. Thanks, Mr Griffin.
"
,,
7,13,"I like what you're

7,13,"So, Connie, now that
"
,,
7,13,"you're dating my brother,
"
,,
7,13,"maybe we can hang out, y'know?
"
,,
7,13,"Hey, after dinner,
"
,,
7,13,"you wanna come up to my room
"
,,
7,13,"and give each other makeovers?
"
,,
7,13,"I don't use makeup, Meg.
"
,,
7,13,"Course you don't. You're all natural.
"
,,
7,13,"Man, your dad must be proud.
"
,,
7,13,"Actually, my dad
"
,,
7,13,"passed away 4 years ago.
"
,,
7,13,"Yeah, yeah, he did.
"
,,
7,13,"He sure did.

"
,,
7,13,"Ho ho. You know it, brother.
"
,,
7,13,"It's gonna be awesome.
"
,,
7,13,"But keep it on the down low,
"
,,
7,13,"so the spazoids don't catch wind.
"
,,
7,13,"Ha-haaaah!
"
,,
7,13,"Agh! Speaking of spazoids ...
"
,,
7,13,"Wow, can you believe it, Connie?
"
,,
7,13,"You and I are gonna be
"
,,
7,13,"at the same party this weekend.
"
,,
7,13,"Oh, this is so cool!
"
,,
7,13,"Hey, what are you
"
,,
7,13,"wearing, so I make sure I
"
,,
7,13,"don't wear the same thing.
"
,,
7,13,"Um, you're not invited, Meg.
"
,,
7,13,"What?
"
,,
7,13,"But ... it's at my house.
"
,,
7,13,"Uh, Connie, let me handle this.
"
,,
7,13,"I'm sorry, Meg. You can't come.
"
,,
7,13,"There's an arse to boob
"
,,
7,13,"ratio that you're way off of.
"
,,
7,13,"Hey, Chris! C'mon,
"
,,
7,13,"let's corner the nerds

,,
7,13,"that be gay of them?
"
,,
7,13,"Ha ha. Yeah! That is grotacular!
"
,,
7,13," Way to go, man.
"
,,
7,13," Awesome, bro.
"
,,
7,13,"Man, our boy Chris,
"
,,
7,13,"partying with the cool kids.
"
,,
7,13,"I am a very proud dad right now.
"
,,
7,13,"Look at that Connie.
"
,,
7,13,"So young and lithe.
"
,,
7,13,"Look at the shape of that body.
"
,,
7,13,"Look at the shape of that body!
"
,,
7,13,"That's it, Brian!
"
,,
7,13,"That's where one-eyed
"
,,
7,13,"Willy buried his gold!
"
,,
7,13,"Oh, Meg, sweetheart
"
,,
7,13,"why don't you just go
"
,,
7,13,"downstairs and join the party?
"
,,
7,13,"I wasn't invited!
"
,,
7,13,"I hate Chris! He's such a jerk!
"
,,
7,13,"Oh, look, honey, he's
"
,,
7,13,"just a little confused
"
,,
7,13,"about who he is right now.
"
,,
7,13,"I'm sure, deep down,
"
,,
7,13,"he still loves his big sister.
"
,,
7,13,"I hate my school!
"
,,
7,13,"I hate everyone!
"
,,
7,13,"I hate my life!
"
,,
7,13,"OK, look, Meg, I've
"
,,
7,13,"been at this for 45 minutes
"
,,
7,13,"I don't know what else I can say.
"
,,
7,13,"Here's a Sylvia Plath
"
,,
7,13,"book and a bottle of Ambien.
"
,,
7,13,"I'm gonna look the other way,
"
,,
7,13,"and whatever happens, happens.
"
,,
7,13,"Gina, have you seen Chris?
"
,,
7,13,"Yeah, he's over there.
"
,,
7,13,"Uh, Chris, what are you doing?!
"
,,
7,13,"Getting scraped
"
,,
7,13,"to death by my zipper.
"
,,
7,13,"You bastard!
"
,,
7,13,"How the hell can
"
,,
7,13,"you be cheating on me?
"
,,
7,13,"I'm the one who made you popular!
"
,,
7,13,"No, Connie, beating up that
"
,,
7,13,"Jewish kid made me popular.
"
,,
7,13,"Come on, girls! Let's
"
,,
7,13,"go upstairs and make out.
"
,,
7,13,"Oh, no, Connie's been hurt!
"
,,
7,13,"I guess I should lie on
"
,,
7,13,"top of her to keep her warm.
"
,,
7,13,"What are you lookin' at?
"
,,
7,13,"It's a cartoon!
"
,,
7,13,"Chris, I can't believe you
"
,,
7,13,"dissed Connie at your party.
"
,,
7,13,"That was awesome!
"
,,
7,13,"Yeah, I heard about
"
,,
7,13,"it when I was making
"
,,
7,13,"that gay nerd spoon with me.
"
,,
7,13,"Hey, guys ...
"
,,
7,13,"Room for one more?
"
,,
7,13,"I don't think so.
"
,,
7,13," Loser!
"
,,
7,13," Reject!
"
,,
7,13,"Everyone's gay but me.
"
,,
7,13,"My God, he's practically ruined me.
"
,,
7,13,"I've created a monster.
"
,,
7,13,"Meg, we've gotta do something.
"
,,
7,13,"""We""? Are you kidding?
"
,,
7,13,"Do you really think
"
,,
7,13,"I would help you out
"
,,
7,13,"in any way, after
"
,,
7,13,"everything you've done to me?
"
,,
7,13,"What are you talking about?
"
,,
7,13,"You see this, Connie?
"
,,
7,13,"This is from when you called me
"
,,
7,13,"""sticky arse cow"" in 6th grade.
"
,,
7,13,"This one is from when
"
,,
7,13,"you made a plaster cast of
"
,,
7,13,"my vagina, freshman year.
"
,,
7,13,"You want my help?
"
,,
7,13,"You can go #@!% yourself!!
"
,,
7,13,"Hey, Meg! Think fast!
"
,,
7,13,"Ha-ha! Loser!
"
,,
7,13,"Alright, let's do it.
"
,,
7,13,"When we're done with him,
"
,,
7,13,"he'll be more of an outcast than
"
,,
7,13,"a seagull at an Adam Sandler movie.
"
,,
7,13,"This is my old bicycle that
"
,,
7,13,"I had from when I was ten.
"
,,
7,13,"Sometimes the
"
,,
7,13,"banana seat hurts my hynie.
"
,,
7,13,"Will you shut up?
"
,,
7,13,"You shut up, man! It's a comedy!
"
,,
7,13,"When I ring the bell, it
"
,,
7,13,"makes my pants feel funny.
"
,,
7,13,"Ring, ring, ring!
"
,,
7,13,"Ah, another day of being huge.
"
,,
7,13,"Good morning, Guns of Navaro ...
"
,,
7,13,"Oh, no!
"
,,
7,13,"What's happening?!
"
,,
7,13,"I'll tell you what's happening.
"
,,
7,13,"Your steroids have worn off.
"
,,
7,13,"You're weak like everyone else.
"
,,
7,13,"And guess what?
"
,,
7,13,"There's a toll in the hall, now.
"
,,
7,13,"Stay away from me!
"
,,
7,13,"Stay away from me!
"
,,
7,13,"Stewie, no!
"
,,
7,13,"And now ... here's something
"
,,
7,13,"we hope you'll really like.
"
,,
7,13,"Settle down, everyone.
"
,,
7,13,"OK, let's get this assembly started.
"
,,
7,13,"Is everything set, Meg?
"
,,
7,13,"Once Chris gets up there, my
"
,,
7,13,"friend in the AV department
"
,,
7,13,"will take care of everything.
"
,,
7,13,"OK, Meg, remember our deal.
"
,,
7,13,"I do this for you,
"
,,
7,13,"and I have your permission
"
,,
7,13,"to think about you later
"
,,
7,13,"tonight when I'm in the tub.
"
,,
7,13,"Fine, Neil
"
,,
7,13,"Awesome! I might
"
,,
7,13,"even go lefty tonight.
"
,,
7,13,"Stranger in the tub.
"
,,
7,13,"Before we begin, Chris Griffin has
"
,,
7,13,"an announcement for the cool kids.
"
,,
7,13,"Yeah, hey, guys.
"
,,
7,13,"The meeting of the
"
,,
7,13,"Cool Kids Club will be at 3:15
"
,,
7,13,"leaning up against Tim
"
,,
7,13,"Breckner's SUV in the parking lot.
"
,,
7,13,"Hey, Chris. What's that?
"
,,
7,13,"Did you sit on something?
"
,,
7,13,"Chris Griffin's a freak!
"
,,
7,13,"What a loser!
"
,,
7,13,"I'm gay, alright?
"
,,
7,13,"Ah, c'mon, it's me!
"
,,
7,13,"Griffa!
"
,,
7,13,"You don't get to
"
,,
7,13,"talk like that anymore!
"
,,
7,13,"Connie, the person who humiliated
"
,,
7,13,"you has himself been humiliated.
"
,,
7,13,"By the rules of high school,
"
,,
7,13,"you are now popular again.
"
,,
7,13,"Well, we did it, Connie.
"
,,
7,13,"Thanks for your help, Meg.
"
,,
7,13,"There no chance we're gonna
"
,,
7,13," be friends now, is there?
"
,,
7,13,"Absolutely not.
"
,,
7,13,"Can I at least think
"
,,
7,13,"about you in the tub later?
"
,,
7,13,"No.
"
,,
7,13,"I'm still gonna.
"
,,
7,13,"Well, Chris, you must feel ridiculous.
"
,,
7,13,"I do, dad.
"
,,
7,13,"And Meg, I'm really
"
,,
7,13,"sorry I was such a douche.
"
,,
7,13,"Well, there is a way
"
,,
7,13,"you can make it up to me.
"
,,
7,13,"How?
"
,,
7,13,"Tell me what it was like ...
"
,,
7,13,"being one of them.
"
,,
7,13,"It was like basking in the warm
"
,,
7,13,"glow of a higher intelligence,
"
,,
7,13,"and it envelopes you,
"
,,
7,13,"and allows you to become
"
,,
7,13,"part of its everlasting glory.
"
,,
7,13,"I flew today.
"
,,
7,14,"Hey, everybody.
"
,,
7,14,"Look what came in the mail.
"
,,
7,14,"We got invitations
"
,,
7,14,"to Jillian's wedding.
"
,,
7,14,"Jillian's wedding?
"
,,
7,14,"She's getting married?
"
,,
7,14,"Wow, that's great.
"
,,
7,14,"Looks like she finally found
"
,,
7,14,"someone after dating that last loser.
"
,,
7,14,"She dated someone after me?
"
,,
7,14,"No. See how I set up my own
"
,,
7,14,"joke? You walked right into it, Brian.
"
,,
7,14,"Walk right in. Sit right down.
"
,,
7,14,"Stewie's gonna make you the fool.
"
,,
7,14,"Peter, here's your invite.
"
,,
7,14,"Chris, Meg, Stewie, and me.
"
,,
7,14,"Uhhhh ......
"
,,
7,14,"probably one more in there.
"
,,
7,14,"No, doesn't look like it.
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, yeah, here it is.
"
,,
7,14,"Brian. Oh, no, wait.
"
,,
7,14,"It's for B. Ryan.
"
,,
7,14,"Ah, cool, Mrs G. Thanks
"
,,
7,14,"for lettin' me stay here
"
,,
7,14,"the last couple of weeks.
"
,,
7,14,"I've enjoyed his company.
"
,,
7,14,"She invited everybody except me?
"
,,
7,14,"What the hell?
"
,,
7,14,"We dated for 6 months.
"
,,
7,14,"Ouch! Well, Brian, looks
"
,,
7,14,"like you're the odd man out.
"
,,
7,14,"Like a non-praying mantis.
"
,,
7,14,"Bless us, oh Lord, for these
"
,,
7,14,"gifts we are about to receive.
"
,,
7,14,"Help us to be mindful
"
,,
7,14,"of all our blessings ...
"
,,
7,14,"and ...
"
,,
7,14,"Brian, I'm filling
"
,,
7,14,"out my RSVP card ...
"
,,
7,14,"and I don't know
"
,,
7,14,"whether I should get the
"
,,
7,14,"salmon or the snausages.
"
,,
7,14,"They're having snausages?
"
,,
7,14,"Yeah, sounds like fun.
"
,,
7,14,"Big deal! I couldn't care less
"
,,
7,14,"about going to that wedding.
"
,,
7,14,"Look on the bright
"
,,
7,14,"side. It frees you up to
"
,,
7,14,"go to Cleveland's barbeque.
"
,,
7,14,"Cleveland's having a barbeque?
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, boy, this is really awkward ...
"
,,
7,14,"None of this is awkward.
"
,,
7,14,"I've moved on from Jillian.
"
,,
7,14,"I've dated plenty
"
,,
7,14,"of other girls since her.
"
,,
7,14," I never do computer dating.
"
,,
7,14," Yeah, me neither.
"
,,
7,14,"So .... you're 27?
"
,,
7,14,"Well, that picture,
"
,,
7,14,"y'know, it was posted
"
,,
7,14,"a couple of years ago.
"
,,
7,14,"So ... so you're ...
"
,,
7,14,"you're a Golden Retriever?
"
,,
7,14,"Well, it's a Retriever mix ...
"
,,
7,14,"... b ... bra ... doodle.
"
,,
7,14,"Wh ... where is that waitress?
"
,,
7,14,"Fine! If you're so over her,
"
,,
7,14,"we should all go out to dinner.
"
,,
7,14,"You, me, Jillian and her fiance.
"
,,
7,14,"Unless you're uncomfortable.
"
,,
7,14,"I would have no problem with
"
,,
7,14,"that. I'd love to meet the fiance.
"
,,
7,14,"Great! And I'm sure
"
,,
7,14,"Dushawn would love to meet you.
"
,,
7,14," Dushawn?
"
,,
7,14," Ahh ... his name's Derek.
"
,,
7,14,"But look at your face.
"
,,
7,14,"We now return to ... ""The Hills""
"
,,
7,14,"Justin Bobby was
"
,,
7,14,"supposed to be here, already.
"
,,
7,14,"Are you still going out with him?
"
,,
7,14,"I guess so.
"
,,
7,14,"I hate how he pushes
"
,,
7,14,"his bangs out of his face
"
,,
7,14,"with every word he says.
"
,,
7,14,"Ummm ...  order me a beer.
"
,,
7,14,"I have to find a
"
,,
7,14,"spot for my motorcycle.
"
,,
7,14," Hi, guys.
"
,,
7,14," Hi, Jillian.
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, hey, Jillian. Congratulations
"
,,
7,14,"on your upcoming nuptuals.
"
,,
7,14,"Oh! Are they showing?
"
,,
7,14,"It's a really thin bra.
"
,,
7,14,"Peter, I came over
"
,,
7,14,"to ask you something.
"
,,
7,14,"Will you give me
"
,,
7,14,"away at my wedding?
"
,,
7,14,"Wow, sure. That'd be great!
"
,,
7,14,"Jillian, don't you want your
"
,,
7,14,"own father to give you away?
"
,,
7,14,"Lois, don't ruin this for me.
"
,,
7,14,"Don't ruin this like
"
,,
7,14,"you ruined Kicks cereal.
"
,,
7,14,"Mmmm. This Kicks
"
,,
7,14,"cereal is good tasting.
"
,,
7,14,"And it's good for you.
"
,,
7,14,"Naaaah!!!
"
,,
7,14,"My father can't give
"
,,
7,14,"me away 'cause he's dead..
"
,,
7,14,"Ha ha ...
"
,,
7,14,"Well then, Peter would
"
,,
7,14,"be happy to do the honours.
"
,,
7,14,"Plus, when's the next time you're
"
,,
7,14,"gonna get to give a bride away?
"
,,
7,14,"I know. This is a once
"
,,
7,14,"in a lifetime opportunity.
"
,,
7,14,"You can give me away
"
,,
7,14,"when I get married, dad.
"
,,
7,14,"N-a-a-a-a-h!
"
,,
7,14,"Merci, mademoiselle.
"
,,
7,14,"And for the gentleman ... ?

7,14,"Ah ha ha ha. Bon.
"
,,
7,14,"Excellent. Merci, monsieur.
"
,,
7,14,"Wow, Derek, that's pretty
"
,,
7,14,"good French you speak there.
"
,,
7,14,"He also speaks 'Orange'.
"
,,
7,14," Mandarin, honey.
"
,,
7,14," Mandolin.
"
,,
7,14,"O-o-o-h ... o-o-o-h!
"
,,
7,14,"Hey, hey. What luck, huh?
"
,,
7,14,"Wow, sweetie! That was amazing.
"
,,
7,14,"Ha, I don't think I could do
"

7,14,"that again in a million years.
"
,,
7,14," Ahhhhhhh ... oh ... oh ... oh ...
"
,,
7,14," Aah ... ah ... ah ... ah

,,
7,14,"I caught ... this piece.
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, my God! Sir, are you alright?
"
,,
7,14,"Ahhh ... I don't know.
"
,,
7,14,"I actually just had elbow surgery.
"
,,
7,14,"I wasn't even supposed
"
,,
7,14,"to come in to work today ...
"
,,
7,14,"Why would you
"
,,
7,14,"trip me deliberately?!
"
,,
7,14,"I ...I'm ... I'm sorry.
"
,,
7,14,"Dinner's goin' great.
"
,,
7,14,"You know, I can probably
"
,,
7,14,"help you with that elbow.
"
,,
7,14," Does that feel better?
"
,,
7,14," Yeah, it feels a lot better.
"
,,
7,14,"Wow, you're the best man ever.
"
,,
7,14,"Oh ho ho, hardly.

,,
7,14,"Excuse me, I'm just gonna

"
,,
7,14,"... I just need to know
"
,,
7,14,"if he has any shortcomings
"
,,
7,14,"that'll make me feel better.
"
,,
7,14,"You are not even ...
"
,,
7,14,"You're goin' in there to look ...
"
,,
7,14,"That's even gayer.

"
,,
7,14,"Well, otherwise it was

"
,,
7,14,"So fun.
"
,,
7,14,"Y'know, I had a
"
,,
7,14,"really fun night, Brian.
"
,,
7,14,"You seem like a really cool guy.
"
,,
7,14,"Yeah, um ... Hey,
"
,,
7,14,"y'know, if you don't mind ...
"
,,
7,14,"I'm sorta a low
"
,,
7,14,"profile kinda person, so ...
"
,,
7,14,"I'm gonna take off before

"
,,
7,14,"Hey ... Brian, is that you?

7,14,"Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
"
,,
7,14,"Who's that?
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, it's just this jerk
"
,,
7,14,"that goes to my school.
"
,,
7,14,"You go to school?
"
,,
7,14,"No, I just lied to you
"
,,
7,14,"and I'm not really sure why.
"
,,
7,14,"Is this the longest
"
,,
7,14,"light ever, or what?
"
,,
7,14,"Ah, there we go!
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, my God! How do
"
,,
7,14,"you two know each other?

,,
7,14,"Well, I'm Stewie.
"
,,
7,14,"I'm Lauren, it's good to meet you.
"

,,
7,14,"need a gay friend on the
"
,,
7,14,"show .. a friend on the show?
"
,,
7,14,"Hey, you know what? I'm
"
,,
7,14,"actually on my way to go shoot now
"
,,
7,14,"if you want, you guys can tag along.
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, ah, I don't know if we have time.
"
,,
7,14,"Yes, we would love to.
"
,,
7,14,"Brian, don't wreck this for me.
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, my God! I have
"
,,
7,14,"the perfect hat for this.
"
,,
7,14,"Listen, Lauren, I'm not .. not
"
,,
7,14,"super comfortable being on camera.
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, relax. After a little while
"
,,
7,14,"you'll forget they're even there.
"
,,
7,14,"What's everybody looking at?
"
,,
7,14,"The salesman told me it was unisex.
"
,,
7,14,"Hey, those people look familiar.
"
,,
7,14,"Ah, that's Heidi and Spencer.
"
,,
7,14,"I don't really talk to them.
"
,,
7,14,"Wow, Spencer does
"
,,
7,14,"look like a monkey.
"
,,
7,14,"Spencer, I am so
"
,,
7,14,"over your selfishness.
"
,,
7,14,"Whatta ya want? I came out to
"
,,
7,14,"Hollywood, I'm on camera all day
"
,,
7,14,"and I turned my
"
,,
7,14,"back on my own kind.
"
,,
7,14,"Uuugh... there's Brody
"
,,
7,14,"Jenner. God, what a douchebag.
"
,,
7,14,"I can't believe that came
"
,,
7,14,"out of Bruce Jenner's vagina.
"
,,
7,14,"Bruce Jenner is a man.
"
,,
7,14,"No, Brian. That's what
"
,,
7,14,"the Press would have
"
,,
7,14,"you believe. But he's not.
"
,,
7,14,"Bruce Jenner is a woman. An
"
,,
7,14,"elegant, beautiful, Dutch woman.
"
,,
7,14,"This is where they
"
,,
7,14,"edit the show together.
"
,,
7,14,"Lauren, we've got a rough
"
,,
7,14,"cut of next week's episode.
"
,,
7,14," Can you queue that up, Terry?
"
,,
7,14," Sure.
"
,,
7,14,"I need to be, like, fine,
"
,,
7,14,"to be alone, and, like, not
"
,,
7,14,"even want to date someone
"
,,
7,14,"and then I know I'll be
"
,,
7,14,"fine to get into a relationship.
"
,,
7,14,"That's it? That was like, 5 seconds.
"
,,
7,14,"It's OK. They fill the
"
,,
7,14,"rest with shots of street
"
,,
7,14,"signs, and fronts of restaurants
"
,,
7,14,"and old footage from the A Team.
"
,,
7,14,"Hey, Brian, where
"
,,
7,14,"were you last night, buddy?
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, I was .. um .. I was out. I
"
,,
7,14,"got a little wrecked after dinner
"
,,
7,14,"and I didn't wanna drive home.
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, yeah? Did you stay in town
"
,,
7,14,"or did you head for 'The Hills?'
"
,,
7,14,"Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
"
,,
7,14,"Wait a minute! How the hell do
"
,,
7,14,"you guys know about that already?
"
,,
7,14,"It's all over the internet. Look!
"
,,
7,14,"Does Lauren Conrad
"
,,
7,14,"have a new beau?
"
,,
7,14,"An anonymous
"
,,
7,14,"source has the answers ..
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, yeah, I know that
"
,,
7,14,"guy. His name's Brian Griffin
"
,,
7,14,"and he definitely
"
,,
7,14,"boned Lauren last night.
"
,,
7,14,"Great ... great...
"
,,
7,14,"That ... that's fantastic.
"
,,
7,14,"Well, I think it's wonderful that
"
,,
7,14," you're datin' such a classy, well
"
,,
7,14,"educated girl like Lauren Conra ...
"
,,
7,14,"ha ha. She's such an idiot, Brian.
"
,,
7,14,"She's such an idiot!
"
,,
7,14,"Yeah, you know
"
,,
7,14,"something, Brian. I bet you
"
,,
7,14,"make the late night monologues.
"
,,
7,14,"I mean, it's a little weird isn't it,
"
,,
7,14," this new Lauren Conrad relationship?
"
,,
7,14,"When asked about their sex
"
,,
7,14,"life, Brian was quoted as saying
"
,,
7,14,"""Oh, yeah, we just do it ""me"" style.""
"
,,
7,14,"Have you seen the news about
"
,,
7,14,"Lauren Conrad and Brian Griffin?
"
,,
7,14,"Y'know, a lot of these
"
,,
7,14,"young Hollywood girls carry
"
,,
7,14,"their little dogs around in their purse.
"
,,
7,14,"But Lauren carries one in her pants.
"
,,
7,14,"Yeah, so Lauren Conrad and
"
,,
7,14,"Brian Griffin are now a couple.
"
,,
7,14,"Apparently she gave
"
,,
7,14,"that dog a bone and
"
,,
7,14,"... he gave it right back!
"
,,
7,14,"Look, I was drunk
"
,,
7,14,"outta my mind, I didn't
"
,,
7,14,"know what I was doing.
"
,,
7,14,"It was a one night
"
,,
7,14,"thing. I have no interest in
"
,,
7,14,"dating one of those shallow
"
,,
7,14,"idiot celebrities who's
"
,,
7,14,"only famous for being famous.
"
,,
7,14,"I'm going over to let her down easy.
"
,,
7,14,"Hey, tell her I like her
"
,,
7,14,"work in ""Jake and the Fatman"".
"
,,
7,14,"Oh no, wait.
"
,,
7,14,"That was William Conrad.
"
,,
7,14,"Tell her I like ""Jake and the Fatman"".
"
,,
7,14,"Can I help you?
"
,,
7,14,"Yeah, I'm Brian. I'm, ah,
"
,,
7,14,"the guy all the comedians
"
,,
7,14,"have been talking about.
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, si! Ha ha ha ha ha.
"
,,
7,14,"Lauren is in the back.
"
,,
7,14,"Just follow the
"
,,
7,14,"music and you will find her.
"
,,
7,14,"Thanks.
"
,,
7,14," Oh, hi Brian.
"
,,
7,14," Wow! Hi.
"
,,
7,14," That's beautiful. What was that?
"
,,
7,14," It's Mozart's violin
"
,,
7,14,"concerto number 1 in B flat.
"
,,
7,14,"Plato's symposium ... this yours?
"
,,
7,14," Oh, yeah.
"
,,
7,14," It's pretty worn out.
"
,,
7,14,"Yeah, I've read it,
"
,,
7,14,"like, a hundred times.
"
,,
7,14,"I find Aristfanes'
"
,,
7,14,"quasi satirical origin myth
"
,,
7,14,"regarding the three genders
"
,,
7,14,"both fantastic and serious.
"
,,
7,14,"Yeah, that .. er .. that
"
,,
7,14,"always cracked me up.
"
,,
7,14,"So, you read a lot, huh?
"
,,
7,14,"Yeah, but I try not
"
,,
7,14,"to let it interfere with
"
,,
7,14,"my biomolecular research.
"
,,
7,14,"Biomolecular?
"
,,
7,14,"I ... I don't understand.
"
,,
7,14,"Come on. I'll show
"
,,
7,14,"you what I did yesterday.
"
,,
7,14,"It'll make you feel ... young,
"
,,
7,14,"as when the world was new.
"
,,
7,14," You did all this in a day?
"
,,
7,14," The matrix formed in a day.
"
,,
7,14,"The life forms grew later at
"
,,
7,14,"a substantially accelerated rate.
"
,,
7,14,"Can I cook? Or can't I?
"
,,
7,14,"This doesn't make any sense. If
"
,,
7,14,"you're so smart why do you hide it?
"
,,
7,14,"Come on, Brian. You know
"
,,
7,14,"America doesn't like smart people.
"
,,
7,14,"They elected Bush twice.
"
,,
7,14,"Yeah, once, but .. so this whole
"
,,
7,14," persona is just a publicity stunt?
"
,,
7,14,"Publicity is what keeps
"
,,
7,14,"this franchise running, Brian.
"
,,
7,14,"We're even using state of the
"
,,
7,14,"art computer animation to create
"
,,
7,14,"a fake sex tape
"
,,
7,14,"with me and Bill Cosby.
"
,,
7,14,"Now, you will get ready for the
"
,,
7,14,"zim zam and the babbidy bibbedy.
"
,,
7,14,"and you will take off your
"
,,
7,14,"clothes, like vooo and voooom
"
,,
7,14,"and get ready for
"
,,
7,14,"the most splendiferous
"
,,
7,14,"pudding pop you have ever seen.
"
,,
7,14,"Alright, Jillian, since I'm giving
"
,,
7,14,"you away on your wedding day
"
,,
7,14,"I wanna make sure it
"
,,
7,14,"all goes off without a hitch.
"
,,
7,14,"Now, what are your
"
,,
7,14,"thoughts on a wedding singer?
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, I thought that maybe I
"
,,
7,14,"would just DJ the wedding myself.
"
,,
7,14,"I already made a playlist on this.
"
,,
7,14," A box of Junior Mints?
"
,,
7,14," This isn't an iPod?
"
,,
7,14," Do Junior Mints play MP3s?
"
,,
7,14," My iPod is chocolate?
"
,,
7,14,"Well, be that as it may,
"
,,
7,14," or not be that, I was thinkin'
"
,,
7,14," I could be your wedding singer.
"
,,
7,14,"That's a great idea, Peter!
"
,,
7,14,"Sweet! And I promise you'll be
"
,,
7,14,"able to understand all the words.
"
,,
7,14,"Not like Sting where you
"
,,
7,14,"can only understand the last 3.
"
,,
7,14,"... brand new day ..
"
,,
7,14,"So, did you break up with  Lauren?
"
,,
7,14,"No, I didn't. As a matter of fact,
"
,,
7,14,"she's coming over for dinner tonight.
"
,,
7,14,"Say what?!
"
,,
7,14,"Well, Lauren, it's a real
"
,,
7,14,"pleasure havin' you here for dinner.
"
,,
7,14,"Of course, I'm sure this isn't
"
,,
7,14,"as exciting as your usual cuisine.
"
,,
7,14,"Y'know, all that caviar
"
,,
7,14,"with the little silver spoons
"
,,
7,14,"Actually, Mrs Griffin, caviar
"
,,
7,14,"spoons are carved from bone.
"
,,
7,14,"They don't use metal because
"
,,
7,14,"it reacts chemically with the
"
,,
7,14,"fish eggs and changes their taste.
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, well that's fascinating.
"
,,
7,14,"You could have just
"
,,
7,14,"complimented the free food,
"
,,
7,14,"but one upping
"
,,
7,14,"me is another way to go.
"
,,
7,14," So, y'know, guys ...
"
,,
7,14," Bitch.
"
,,
7,14,"Lauren just finished
"
,,
7,14,"a fascinating doctoral thesis
"
,,
7,14,"on sub-orbital
"
,,
7,14,"propulsion mechanisms
"
,,
7,14,"that NASA is using for the
"
,,
7,14,"next generation of space shuttles.
"
,,
7,14,"Oooohhhhhh ... Aaaaahhhh!
"
,,
7,14,"So, Lauren, um, whenever
"
,,
7,14," I'm watchin' your show ... 
"
,,
7,14,"... you give me wood.
"
,,
7,14,"Where do we go from here?
"
,,
7,14,"Well, I could sign a picture for you.
"
,,
7,14,"Uh, yeah, sure,
"
,,
7,14,"that'd be fine. Thank you.
"
,,
7,14,"So, Lauren, do you and
"
,,
7,14,"Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan
"
,,
7,14," all hang out and
"
,,
7,14,"go drunk driving together?
"
,,
7,14,"I heard that Lindsay
"
,,
7,14,"Lohan wasn't driving that night.
"
,,
7,14,"She was taking the rap for a friend.
"
,,
7,14,"Road hog!
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, no! I already have 2 strikes.
"
,,
7,14," I'll take the wheel, Mr Magoo.
"
,,
7,14," I'm too old to go to prison.
"
,,
7,14,"They'll rape me! And I'll
"
,,
7,14,"never see 'em coming, no I won't.
"
,,
7,14,"Well, uh, Lauren and I had a
"
,,
7,14,"great time today at the Art museum.
"
,,
7,14,"There was a special exhibition
"
,,
7,14,"of rare Monet paintings ...
"
,,
7,14," Manet, honey.
"
,,
7,14," What?
"
,,
7,14,"It was actually the
"
,,
7,14,"Manet exhibit, not Monet ...
"
,,
7,14,"But no big deal. People
"
,,
7,14,"make that mistake all the time.
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, right.
"
,,
7,14,"Y'know, I don't mean
"
,,
7,14,"to be rude, but do you
"
,,
7,14,"have a more comfortable chair?
"
,,
7,14,"This one's really hurting my back.
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, my God! Quagmire, you
"
,,
7,14,"come out from under there!
"
,,
7,14,"I'm sorry everybody. I just
"
,,
7,14,"wanted to meet her so bad.
"
,,
7,14,"I can't do anything right.
"
,,
7,14,"I'll go have a talk with him.
"
,,
7,14,"Hey, buddy, where are all your pals?
"
,,
7,14," Playin' baseball.
"
,,
7,14," Well, why aren't you
"
,,
7,14,"playin' with 'em?
"
,,
7,14," 'Cause I don't have a glove.
"
,,
7,14," Oh, yeah?
"
,,
7,14," Gee! Just for me? No fooling?
"
,,
7,14," Nah, just kidding. It's mine.
"
,,
7,14," Oh.
"
,,
7,14," Yeah.
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, sweetie, dinner with your
"
,,
7,14,"family was so much fun tonight.
"
,,
7,14,"Yeah, I think they really liked you.
"
,,
7,14,"It was so cute when
"
,,
7,14,"you thought Manet was Monet.
"
,,
7,14,"Yeah .. yeah .. that .. that was a hoot.
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, hey, how are you
"
,,
7,14,"liking my unabridged history
"
,,
7,14,"of 2nd World War naval
"
,,
7,14,"tactics in the Pacific theatre?
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, it's really, um .. interesting ..
"
,,
7,14,"I'm at the part where
"
,,
7,14,"they detail the account
"
,,
7,14,"of Admiral Halsey's
"
,,
7,14,"victory at Midway.
"
,,
7,14,"You mean Admiral
"
,,
7,14,"Spruance, sweetie.
"
,,
7,14,"Huh?
"
,,
7,14,"Well, Halsey was
"
,,
7,14,"hospitalized with cirrhosis
"
,,
7,14,"at the outset of the battle
"
,,
7,14,"so Spruance, who
"
,,
7,14,"prior to June of 1941,
"
,,
7,14,"was primarily a desk Admiral
"
,,
7,14,"was charged with leading the
"
,,
7,14,"naval fleet at Midway against Japan.
"
,,
7,14,"A victory which
"
,,
7,14,"surprised even his peers.
"
,,
7,14,"And in fact, was a
"
,,
7,14,"turning point for the American
"
,,
7,14,"naval forces in the Pacific.
"
,,
7,14,"No, yeah. That's ..
"
,,
7,14,"that's the part I'm at.
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, my God, you're so cute
"
,,
7,14,"when you don't know
"
,,
7,14,"what you're talking about.
"
,,
7,14,"Well, wait a minute. What
"
,,
7,14,"the hell does that mean?
"
,,
7,14,"Are you saying I'm not smart?
"
,,
7,14,"You don't have to be. You're
"
,,
7,14,"adorable. Like those calendars
"
,,
7,14,"that have monkeys in clothes.
"
,,
7,14,"Look, why don't we talk
"
,,
7,14,"about this in the morning?
"
,,
7,14,"I wanna finish that book.
"
,,
7,14," Sweetie, since when
"
,,
7,14,"do you wear reading glasses?
"
,,
7,14," What? These?
"
,,
7,14," I've had these forever.
"
,,
7,14," Honey, those aren't real.
"
,,
7,14," Sure they are.
"
,,
7,14," No .. they're not.
"
,,
7,14,"I can see the little
"
,,
7,14,"Austin Powers logo on the side.
"
,,
7,14,"What are you talkin'
"
,,
7,14,"about?  These are my glasses.
"
,,
7,14,"Yeah, baby, yeah!
"
,,
7,14," Alright, I can't do this.
"
,,
7,14," Can't do what?
"
,,
7,14,"I can't date someone
"
,,
7,14,"who's smarter than I am.
"
,,
7,14,"I feel like Jillian.
"
,,
7,14,"O-o-o-o-o-h-h-h-h ..
"
,,
7,14," What? What, what,
"
,,
7,14,"what? What is that?
"
,,
7,14,"I think I get it.
"
,,
7,14,"This isn't about me
"
,,
7,14,"being smarter than you.
"
,,
7,14,"This is about you still
"
,,
7,14,"being in love with Jillian.
"
,,
7,14," How do you know that?
"
,,
7,14," Because I'm smarter than you, Brian.
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, my God ...
"
,,
7,14,"You're right!
"
,,
7,14,"Y'know, I thought I was
"
,,
7,14,"over her, but .. I'm .. I'm not.
"
,,
7,14,"Somewhere along the line she
"
,,
7,14,"must have gotten under my skin.
"
,,
7,14,"I'm in love with her. How
"
,,
7,14,"could I have been so miopic?
"
,,
7,14," ""Myopic"".
"
,,
7,14," Thank you, Lauren!
"
,,
7,14,"My God, Lauren. What am I gonna
"
,,
7,14,"do? I'm still in love with Jillian.
"
,,
7,14,"Well, there's only one
"
,,
7,14,"thing you can do, Brian.
"
,,
7,14,"Tell her how you feel.
"
,,
7,14,"What's the use? It's
"
,,
7,14,"over. She's moved on.
"
,,
7,14,"Well, who knows? Women
"
,,
7,14,"are complex creatures, Brian.
"
,,
7,14,"Maybe she just needs to be
"
,,
7,14,"reminded how much she misses you.
"
,,
7,14,"And I know exactly
"
,,
7,14,"how to do that, Brian.
"
,,
7,14,"She needs to see you on
"
,,
7,14,"the arm of a beautiful woman.
"
,,
7,14," What is this gonna do?
"
,,
7,14," It's gonna make her jealous.
"
,,
7,14,"You, out on the
"
,,
7,14,"town with a hot date.
"
,,
7,14,"How are you a hot date?
"
,,
7,14,"Whoa! You're angry at her, not me.
"
,,
7,14,"No wonder you're alone.
"
,,
7,14,"This isn't working at all. She
"
,,
7,14,"doesn't even know we're here.
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, she will, Brian. And she's gonna
"
,,
7,14,"be upset that your date is so into you.
"
,,
7,14,"Ok, ready? I've
"
,,
7,14,"been reading up on things that
"
,,
7,14,"sound sexy.
"
,,
7,14,"""Oh, Brian, I can't wait
"
,,
7,14,"til after dinner
"
,,
7,14,"'cause then we'll go home and you
"
,,
7,14,"can watch me have my period"".
"
,,
7,14,"What the hell's wrong
"
,,
7,14,"with you? That's not sexy!
"
,,
7,14,"Hey, Brian. I just
"
,,
7,14,"noticed you over here.
"
,,
7,14," Hi, I'm Jillian.
"
,,
7,14," Desiree. Charmed!
"
,,
7,14,"Well, I wish we could
"
,,
7,14,"stay. But we have quite
"
,,
7,14,"an exciting evening planned.
"
,,
7,14,"Oh, oh, yeah, right.
"
,,
7,14,"We're really hittin' the town.
"
,,
7,14,"Yes, we're gonna
"
,,
7,14,"douche the night away.
"
,,
7,14,"Uh, well, have fun. You
"
,,
7,14,"two are a really cute couple.
"
,,
7,14,"Hey, Desiree.
"
,,
7,14,"Oh ... hey, Lee...
"
,,
7,14,"Brian,this is Lee.
"
,,
7,14,"Lee, this is Brian.
"
,,
7,14,"I know Lee from ...
"
,,
7,14," ... Starbucks.
"
,,
7,14," Hey, is that Desiree?
"
,,
7,14,"That's it. I mean, I
"
,,
7,14,"don't know what else I can
"
,,
7,14,"do. The wedding's tomorrow
"
,,
7,14,"and she hasn't shown
"
,,
7,14,"any signs of leaving Derek.
"
,,
7,14," I've completely run out of options.
"
,,
7,14," Not quite, Brian.
"
,,
7,14," There's still one thing you can do.
"
,,
7,14," What's that?
"
,,
7,14,"Go for broke. Just throw all
"
,,
7,14,"your cards on the table at once.
"
,,
7,14,"Show her that you love her in
"
,,
7,14,"a way she can't possibly ignore.

7,14,"I want you .. no .. I need you
"
,,
7,14,"with all my heart and soul.
"
,,
7,14,"And my only regret is that I
"
,,
7,14,"didn't realize it
"
,,
7,14,"when we were together.
"
,,
7,14,"Those were the
"
,,
7,14,"happiest days of my life and
"
,,
7,14,"I want more of
"
,,
7,14,"those days. Please, Jillian ...
"

7,14,"please take me back?
"

7,14,"Brian, no.

7,14,"I mean, I thought
"
,,
7,14,"you were my 'Soul Train' ..
"
,,
7,14," but you didn't want me.
"
,,
7,14," 'Soul Mate.'
"
,,
7,14,"Soul Food? I'm sorry ...
"

7,14," Yeah.
"

"
,,
7,14," At least you gave it your all.
"
,,
7,14," I guess you're right.

"
,,
7,14," Well, look at it this way ...
"

7,14,"You may have lost Jillian but
"
,,
7,14,"you can at least be
"

7,14,"happy that she's happy.
"
,,
7,14," Plus you can always call Lauren.
"
,,
7,14," No, I can't.
"

7,15,"went looking for a dead body
"

7,15,"and instead found ..... themselves.

7,15,"... and also a dead body.
"
,,
7,15,"The year was 1955
"
,,
7,15,"and the voice in my head

7,15,"Cleve, it's 1955.

7,15,"into writing more serious stuff.

7,15,"the reader doesn't have a load in

7,15,"Am I wearing lipstick?
"

7,15,"Not any more.
"
,,
7,15,"Um, Paul, quick question,
"
,,
7,15,"and feel free to say no,
"
,,
7,15,"but I couldn't help but notice
"
,,
7,15,"the new Snuggly Jeff manuscript
"
,,
7,15,"in your bag, and, I was
"
,,
7,15,"wondering if I could read it
"
,,
7,15,"then kill you if I hate it?
"
,,
7,15,"Well, I guess that'd be OK.
"
,,
7,15,"Oh, thankyou, thankyou, thankyou!
"
,,
7,15,"Can I read it while I touch
"
,,
7,15,"your ear and suck my thumb?
"
,,
7,15,"Uh, I guess.
"
,,
7,15,"Oh, goody, goody!
"
,,
7,15,"Stewie?
"
,,
7,15,"I just finished the
"
,,
7,15,"book, you dirty birdy!
"
,,
7,15,"How could you?
"
,,
7,15,"He can't be dead!
"
,,
7,15,"Snuggly Jeff cannot be dead!
"
,,
7,15,"Aaaaaarrrr!!
"
,,
7,15,"Look, Stewie, I've gone as
"
,,
7,15,"far as I can with Snuggly Jeff,
"
,,
7,15,"and I .. I wanna
"
,,
7,15,"write something more serious
"
,,
7,15,"Well, you are gonna write
"
,,
7,15,"Snuggly Jeff back to life, Mr. Man.
"
,,
7,15,"Look, Stewie, first of all,
"
,,
7,15,"you're insane.
"
,,
7,15,"And second of all, I have
"
,,
7,15,"to be inspired before I write.
"
,,
7,15,"Well, how 'bout a little TV?
"
,,
7,15,"No, no, no!
"
,,
7,15,"This won't do, Paul.
"
,,
7,15,"You can't just have Snuggly Jeff
"
,,
7,15,"magically brought back to life
"
,,
7,15,"by a child's wish.
"
,,
7,15,"It's insulting to the reader!
"
,,
7,15,"What do you mean?
"
,,
7,15,"Well, it's just bad story telling.
"
,,
7,15,"Let's see ... How
"
,,
7,15,"can I explain this to you?
"
,,
7,15,"Did you ever see the movie Contact?
"
,,
7,15,"Yeah.
"
,,
7,15,"So, like, they spent a trillion dollars
"
,,
7,15,"building this mile high space machine
"
,,
7,15,"and Jake Busey blows it up.
"
,,
7,15,"So, now they're all like:
"
,,
7,15,"""Oh, no. We can't
"
,,
7,15,"use the space machine""
"
,,
7,15,"But then this other guy's like:
"
,,
7,15,"""Hey, it just so happens,
"
,,
7,15,"""I built another identical
"
,,
7,15,"trillion dollar space machine
"
,,
7,15,"at my own expense,
"
,,
7,15,"on the other side of the world""
"
,,
7,15,"And we're supposed to believe
"
,,
7,15,"no-one noticed that?
"
,,
7,15,"Well, I stood up in the theatre and I said:
"
,,
7,15,"""No! You can't go into space
"
,,
7,15,"because the machine
"
,,
7,15,"already got blown up
"
,,

"
,,
7,15,"Start over!
"
,,
7,15,"Fine. But you're
"
,,
7,15,"gonna have to go into town
"
,,
7,15,"and get me some more paper.
"
,,
7,15,"I'm all out.
"
,,
7,15,"Uh, I don't know, Paul
"
,,
7,15,"Let me see if I can
"
,,
7,15,"get the Big Wheels started.
"
,,
7,15,"Rurrr, rurr, rurr, rurr.
"
,,
7,15,"Oh, I don't know, Paul. It's not starting.
"
,,
7,15,"Rurrr, rurr, rurr, rurr.
"
,,
7,15,"Oh, I'm afraid I'm gonna flood it.
"
,,
7,15,"Rurrr, rurr, rurr, rurr.. Vrooooom!
"
,,
7,15,"Vrooooom! Vrooooom!
"
,,
7,15,"OK. I got it now.
"
,,
7,15,"I'll see you in a bit.
"
,,
7,15,"Heh heh. He's too big for that car.
"
,,
7,15,"Mr. Sheldon?
"
,,
7,15,"Oh, my God! I'm saved!
"
,,
7,15,"Let's get outta here
"
,,
7,15,"before Stewie gets back!
"
,,
7,15,"Ah! My legs!
"
,,
7,15,"Now I'm gonna have to spend
"
,,
7,15,"the rest of my life in a wheelchair!
"
,,
7,15,"No you're not.
"
,,
7,15,"Well, that's it, Stewie.
"
,,
7,15,"The book is done.
"
,,
7,15,"Can I go now?
"
,,
7,15,"Oh, no, Paul. I'm not stupid.
"
,,
7,15,"If I let you go, you'll
"
,,
7,15,"just run straight to the police
"
,,
7,15,"and tell them I kidnapped
"
,,
7,15,"you and held you hostage
"
,,
7,15,"and fondled you
"
,,
7,15,"while you were asleep.
"
,,
7,15,"No, I ...wait ...What?
"
,,
7,15,"You'll tell them that
"
,,
7,15,"while you were sleeping
"
,,
7,15,"I did things to you
"
,,
7,15,"that you don't remember.
"
,,
7,15,"You .. fondled me
"
,,
7,15,"while I was asleep?
"
,,
7,15,"Yeah.
"
,,
7,15,"I don't think I like that.
"
,,
7,15,"Well, it's done.
"
,,
7,15,"Everybody still awake?
"
,,
7,15,"Alright. Big finish.
"
,,
7,15,"Now, you remember
"
,,
7,15,"that Stephen King story
"
,,
7,15,"when the guy went

,,
7,15,"up to the empty hotel

,,
7,15,"and there were those creepy twins
"
,,
7,15,"and a guy was
"
,,
7,15,"runnin' around with that axe

7,15," Ha ha ha ha haa!
"
,,
7,15,"Ah, we've only had one conversation
"
,,
7,15,"but I can tell we're
"
,,
7,15,"gonna be life long friends.
"
,,
7,15,"And since you're
"
,,
7,15,"black and I'm white
"
,,
7,15,"that makes it more
"
,,
7,15,"especial for the audience.
"
,,
7,15,"Inspection!
"
,,
7,15,"You Andy Dufresne?
"
,,
7,15,"A little bit. You?
"
,,
7,15,"Ah ha ha ha ha!
"
,,
7,15,"I'm just tweakin' your bum.
"
,,
7,15,"What can I do for you?
"
,,
7,15,"I understand you
"
,,
7,15,"make Star Wars figurines.
"
,,
7,15,"Oh, Grievous! Wicked!
"
,,
7,15,"Well, anyway, I'm
"
,,
7,15,"a pretty corrupt guy
"
,,
7,15,"so I figured I could sell your
"
,,
7,15,"figurines and pocket the cash.
"
,,
7,15,"What d'ya say?
"
,,
7,15,"I don't know ...
"
,,
7,15,"Oh, come on!
"
,,
7,15,"I'll even cripple that guy
"
,,
7,15,"who rapes you in the shower.
"
,,
7,15,"But I like that guy.
"
,,
7,15,"Too late!
"
,,
7,15,"Ah, my legs!
"
,,
7,15,"Wars figurines Andy carved,</i>
"
,,
7,15,"cleanin' the warden's office.</i>
"
,,
7,15,"OK, you clean up the warden's office
"
,,
7,15,"while I go pop out a pine cone.
"
,,
7,15,"by Gwen Stefani</i>
"
,,
7,15,"that it's a 47 year old fish dog.</i>
"
,,
7,15,"Andy, I think you know why
"
,,
7,15,"I've called you in here today.
"
,,
7,15,"A prison is an
"
,,
7,15,"environment which requires
"
,,
7,15,"the highest level of discipline ...
"
,,
7,15,"and that little stunt you pulled today
"
,,
7,15,".. that little stunt you pulled today
"
,,
7,15,"made a lot of
"
,,
7,15,"people look very foolish.
"
,,
7,15,"Look, warden ..
"
,,
7,15,"we got it rough in here
"
,,
7,15,"I just thought we
"
,,
7,15,"could use a little music.
"
,,
7,15,"Music is expressly
"
,,
7,15,"forbidden inside prison walls!
"
,,
7,15,"My God! How can you be so obtuse?
"
,,
7,15,"What did you call me?
"
,,
7,15,"Obtuse. You're bein' obtuse.
"
,,
7,15,"Two months in the hole!
"
,,
7,15,"Or am I being obtuse?
"
,,
7,15,"Nope, now you're bein' acute.
"
,,
7,15,"hole changed ol' Andy.</i>
"
,,
7,15,"I'm gettin' outta here tonight, Red.
"
,,
7,15,"I'm gonna take the
"
,,
7,15,"poop pipe to the crap swamp.
"
,,
7,15,"Wow. Where you
"
,,
7,15,"headed once you get out?
"
,,
7,15,"Zihuatanejo.
"
,,
7,15,"Sounds fancy.
"
,,
7,15,"Eh, actually, it's
"
,,
7,15,"a filthy Mexican village.
"
,,
7,15,"Listen, Red
"
,,
7,15,"when you get outta here,
"
,,
7,15,"I want you to do somethin' for me.
"
,,
7,15,"Up in a hayfield in Buxton,
"
,,
7,15,"Maine, under an old oak tree,
"
,,
7,15,"there's a rock that has
"
,,
7,15,"no earthly business bein' there.
"
,,
7,15,"Under that rock is a box with
"
,,
7,15,"somethin' I want you to have.
"
,,
7,15,"Course, now that I think about
"
,,
7,15,"it, I've been in her 25 years
"
,,
7,15,"All these landmarks are based
"
,,
7,15,"on possibly outdated observations.
"
,,
7,15,"That whole area could
"
,,
7,15,"be a Wal-Mart by now.
"
,,
7,15,"If it is, pick yourself
"
,,
7,15,"up some nice cheap pants
"
,,
7,15,"and good life to you.
"
,,
7,15,"Inspection!
"
,,
7,15,"Dufresne? Dufresne!
"
,,
7,15,"Dufresne, you better get
"
,,
7,15,"your arse out here before
"
,,
7,15,"here before you make
"
,,
7,15,"me cut this sentence shor ....
"
,,
7,15,"Where is he?
"
,,
7,15,"Where the hell is Dufresne?
"
,,
7,15,"I don't know, Sir.
"
,,
7,15,"I want him found ... now.
"
,,
7,15,"Not after breakfast
"
,,
7,15,"Not after C.S.I.
"
,,
7,15,"Now!
"
,,
7,15,"God, I'm so angry
"
,,
7,15,"I could just throw a rock
"
,,
7,15,"at that poster of David Cassidy.
"
,,
7,15,"his boys didn't realise was</i>
"
,,
7,15,"escaped from Shawshank Prison</i>
"
,,
7,15,"the night before.
"
,,
7,15,"through a river of poop</i>
"
,,
7,15,"Do you believe,
"
,,
7,15,"in your best judgement,
"
,,
7,15,"that you have been rehabilitated?
"
,,
7,15,"Rehabilitated?
"
,,
7,15,"It's just a stupid made up word
"
,,
7,15,"so boys like you
"
,,
7,15,"can sit behind a desk,
"
,,
7,15,"wear a fancy suit,
"
,,
7,15,"and feel important.
"
,,
7,15,"You're a jerk! And I had
"
,,
7,15,"sex with your mother last night!
"
,,
7,15,"And I swear to God,
"
,,
7,15,"you let me out of here,
"
,,
7,15,"first thing I'm
"
,,
7,15,"gonna do is kill again.
"
,,
7,15,"a friend that I had to keep.</i>
"
,,
7,15,"until you reach the tree,</i>
"
,,
7,15,"you'll find the rock.</i>
"
,,
7,15,"willing to go a little further.</i>
"
,,
7,15,"of the town in Mexico, right?</i>
"
,,
7,15,"Crap!
"
,,
7,15,"What? Oh! Oh, is that him?
"
,,
7,15,"Is that..? No, no, beach dog.
"
,,
7,15,"Oh! Oh! Is that Red?
"
,,
7,15,"Is it? No, no. Not him either.
"
,,
7,15,"Where the hell is that jagoff?
"
,,
7,15,"There's like 1200 bucks in that box.
"
,,
7,15,"Oh, my God,
"
,,
7,15,"if he ran off with that ...
"
,,
7,15,"Oh, I am gonna be so pissed!
"
,,
7,15,"And what am I gonna do?
"
,,
7,15,"Go to the authorities?
"
,,
7,15,"I just broke out of prison.
"
,,
7,15,"Now, what? I gotta spend the
"
,,
7,15,"rest of my life here by myself?
"
,,
7,15,"Well, at least I won't have to be
"
,,
7,15,"self conscious about my farting.
"
,,
7,15,"Well, that's our show.
"
,,
7,15,"Thank you, Stephen King.

"
,,
7,16," Yeah, Peter next.
"
,,
7,16,"Oh, I don't think there's
"
,,
7,16,"anything in that black bag for me.
"
,,
7,16,"You're wrong, Peter.
"
,,
7,16,"Let us begin.
"
,,
7,16,"Oh, my! You were
"
,,
7,16,"a very important man.
"
,,
7,16,"You were Griffin Peterson,
"
,,
7,16,"the founder of the city of Quahog.
"
,,
7,16,"Now wait a second, Cool
"
,,
7,16,"Runnings. We learned in school
"
,,
7,16,"that Miles Chatterbox
"
,,
7,16,"Musket founded Quahog, after
"
,,
7,16,"he was saved by the magic clam.
"
,,
7,16,"No, that is a myth.
"
,,
7,16,"Peter, you were
"
,,
7,16,"the founder of Quahog.
"
,,
7,16,"I see ... I see
"
,,
7,16,"England a long time ago.
"
,,
7,16,"It is a crisp, clear Spring morning,
"
,,
7,16,"and Griffin Peterson is
"
,,
7,16,"ridin' to the home of his beloved.
"
,,
7,16,"Peterson, what are you doing
"
,,
7,16,"here? Shouldn't you be down at
"
,,
7,16,"your job, making oblong
"
,,
7,16,"bricks out of manure and straw?
"
,,
7,16,"No, we're off. It's Martin Luther Day.
"
,,
7,16," Ah hah!
"
,,
7,16," Yes, that's a very smart joke.
"
,,
7,16," Isn't that right, comedy professors?
"
,,
7,16," Mmmmm. Oh, yeah. Well done. Indeed.
"
,,
7,16," Now, what d'you want?
"
,,
7,16," I wanna marry your daughter.
"
,,
7,16,"and I'm here to
"
,,
7,16,"ask for your blessing.
"
,,
7,16,"What could you possibly
"
,,
7,16,"have to offer my daughter?
"
,,
7,16,"Well, I'm one of
"
,,
7,16,"the few guys in this town
"
,,
7,16,"who isn't dying a
"
,,
7,16,"slow, painful diarrhoea death.
"
,,
7,16,"Alright, come on in.
"
,,
7,16," Knock, Knock. Lady Redbush?
"
,,
7,16," Griffin! It's so good to see you.
"
,,
7,16,"I'm so horny. Kiss my hand.
"
,,
7,16,"What are you doin' here?
"
,,
7,16,"I was just walkin' off the rotted
"
,,
7,16,"goose anus I had for breakfast
"
,,
7,16,"and I thought I'd come by
"
,,
7,16,"and ask you a little question.
"
,,
7,16," What's that?
"
,,
7,16," Will you marry me?
"
,,
7,16,"Ah! Oh, my God, yes!!
"
,,
7,16,"Yes, I will, Griffin. Oh,
"
,,
7,16,"I thought you'd never ask.
"
,,
7,16," Did you do it?
"
,,
7,16," I did it.
"
,,
7,16,"Ooh yah yah yah
"
,,
7,16,"oh boy yah yah yah yah ...
"
,,
7,16,"But in another part of
"
,,
7,16,"London there was a man
"
,,
7,16,"who was not in such good spirits.
"
,,
7,16,"The King of England.
"
,,
7,16,"Stewart, the turd.
"
,,
7,16,"Oh .... I'm so bored.
"
,,
7,16,"I wish to be entertained.
"
,,
7,16,"Where's my troop of actors?
"
,,
7,16,"Presenting ... the cast
"
,,
7,16,"of How I Met Your Mother.
"
,,
7,16," You told her, I told you I kissed her?
"
,,
7,16," Dude, you broke the bro' code.
"
,,
7,16," That's not against the bro' code.
"
,,
7,16," Yes it is. Article 15B.
"
,,
7,16,"That's the heart
"
,,
7,16,"of the bro' code, man.
"
,,
7,16,"Well, you're right, I
"
,,
7,16,"guess I did break the bro' code.
"
,,
7,16,"Hey! Whoa, whoa,
"
,,
7,16,"whoa, whoa ... whoa ... whoa!
"
,,
7,16,"What is this?
"
,,
7,16,"Are these jokes?
"
,,
7,16,"Do people in other
"
,,
7,16,"castles think this is funny?
"
,,
7,16,"Well, yeah. We get a pretty
"
,,
7,16,"sizeable chunk of Princes 18 to 34.
"
,,
7,16,"I think I'd like to
"
,,
7,16,"delete this from my TIVO.
"
,,
7,16," Are you sure you
"
,,
7,16,"want to delete this program?
"
,,
7,16," Yes.
"
,,
7,16,"Bring me my mid
"
,,
7,16,"season replacement fool!
"
,,
7,16," Hi there.
"
,,
7,16," I want to hear some jokes, fool.
"
,,
7,16,"Well, y'know, I don't really tell jokes.
"
,,
7,16,"I .. I like to tell stories from my life
"
,,
7,16,"and let the humour flow
"
,,
7,16,"organically from everyday situations.
"
,,
7,16,"A-hem.
"
,,
7,16,"Yeah, my aunt Frieda was a real card
"
,,
7,16,"She always had
"
,,
7,16,"the most wonderful spirit,
"
,,
7,16,"even when her mind started to go.
"
,,
7,16,"I remember once, she
"
,,
7,16,"wrote a letter to my uncle Tom
"
,,
7,16,"from whom she'd been
"
,,
7,16,"divorced for several years.
"
,,
7,16,"And in the letter, she'd
"
,,
7,16,"misspelled his name T-O-M-M.
"
,,
7,16,"And I said, ""Frieda, you've
"
,,
7,16,"spelled Tom's name wrong.""
"
,,
7,16,"""You need to take out one of the M's.""
"
,,
7,16,"And she said, ""Which one?""
"
,,
7,16,"Y'know, you're gonna
"
,,
7,16,"be #@%*!@$ dead in 5 seconds
"
,,
7,16,"if aunt Frieda doesn't
"
,,
7,16,"throw a pie at somebody!
"
,,
7,16,"I mean, part of that is you
"
,,
7,16,"sorta have to know my family ...
"
,,
7,16,"Make me laugh!!!
"
,,
7,16,"Hey, look .... keys!
"
,,
7,16,"Ha ha ha ah ah.
"
,,
7,16,"Oh, that's so satirical.
"
,,
7,16,"Ah ha ha. What social commentary?
"
,,
7,16,"Ah ha ha. Well, now
"
,,
7,16,"I'm in a wonderful humour.
"
,,
7,16,"I wish to go for a walk into town.
"
,,
7,16,"Hey, coachman. Let's drive
"
,,
7,16,"on the left side of the road
"
,,
7,16,"and see if that catches on.
"
,,
7,16,"Good Lord! Who is that?
"
,,
7,16,"That's Lady Redbush, and her
"
,,
7,16,"husband-to-be, Griffin Peterson.
"
,,
7,16,"That piece of arse is marrying
"
,,
7,16,"that tall glass of poop juice?
"
,,
7,16,"Well, not if I have
"
,,
7,16,"anything to say about it.
"
,,
7,16,"A woman of that calibre
"
,,
7,16,"should be married to a King.
"
,,
7,16," Well, what are
"
,,
7,16,"you gonna do about him?
"
,,
7,16," I'm the King, jester.
"
,,
7,16,"I'm going to have him exiled
"
,,
7,16,"to the farthest corner of the world.
"
,,
7,16,"And then she'll be all mine.
"
,,
7,16,"Why is he such a jerk to everybody?
"
,,
7,16,"Because he has
"
,,
7,16,"a very, very small penis.
"
,,
7,16,"I've seen it, actually, and .. and it's,
"
,,
7,16,"like,  you don't even
"
,,
7,16,"want to make fun of it,
"
,,
7,16," y'know ... it's just
"
,,
7,16," ... medically fascinating.
"
,,
7,16," I kinda wanna see it.
"
,,
7,16,"Yeah, it's like
"
,,
7,16,"that one grape in the
"
,,
7,16,"bunch that never got to be a grape.
"
,,
7,16,"I wonder what's keepin' Griffin.
"
,,
7,16,"Oh, I'm sure he'll be along, sweetie.
"
,,
7,16,"Remember, he's tubby. It
"
,,
7,16,"takes him a while to move around.
"
,,
7,16,"I hope he didn't get diarrhoea and die.
"
,,
7,16," Can I feel those boobs?
"
,,
7,16," No! Daddy, what are you, sick?
"
,,
7,16,"Hey, it's a different time!
"
,,
7,16,"What a wonderfully exciting day.
"
,,
7,16,"I'm young, I'm all dressed up,
"
,,
7,16,"and I'm on my way
"
,,
7,16,"to marry the woman I love.
"
,,
7,16,"And there's 290 years separating
"
,,
7,16,"me from the films of Kevin Smith.

7,16," Who are you?
"
,,
7,16," I'm King Stewart.
"
,,
7,16," Don't you recognise
"
,,
7,16,"me from the coins?
"
,,
7,16,"Oh, yeah. The one's with your profile.
"
,,
7,16,"You know, you look
"
,,
7,16,"really weird from the side.
"
,,
7,16,"Well, that's something we
"
,,
7,16,"didn't really think out too well
"
,,
7,16,"when we started ...
"
,,
7,16,"but never mind that!!
"
,,
7,16,"You're going into exile, Peterson.
"
,,
7,16,"I'm shipping you out on
"
,,
7,16,"the first boat to the new world.
"
,,
7,16,"But I'm supposed to get married today.
"
,,
7,16,"Oh, yeah? Where you
"
,,
7,16,"going for your honeymoon?
"
,,
7,16," That medium sized hill.
"
,,
7,16," Wrong. Seize him!
"
,,
7,16,"cruelty was only just beginning.</i>
"
,,
7,16,"Maybe he changed his
"
,,
7,16,"mind. Maybe he's not comin'.
"
,,
7,16,"Ohhhhh, come on now. There,
"
,,
7,16,"feel better after I just said that?
"
,,
7,16," Give me one little touch.
"
,,
7,16," No!
"
,,
7,16,"I hate this. I .. I .. I hate my life!
"
,,
7,16," Oh ... the King!
"
,,
7,16," The King is here.
"
,,
7,16,"I didn't vote for him.
"
,,
7,16,"Your Majesty, this is
"
,,
7,16,"a real honour. Carter Redbush.
"
,,
7,16,"Very glad to meet you.
"
,,
7,16,"Hello. Harry McAfee.
"
,,
7,16,"As a citizen, I'm proud
"
,,
7,16,"to have you reign over me
"
,,
7,16,"and the McAfee Fertilizer company.
"
,,
7,16,"Lady Redbush, I wish I
"
,,
7,16,"was here on a happier errand.
"
,,
7,16,"But I'm afraid I must inform
"
,,
7,16,"you that Griffin Peterson is dead.
"
,,
7,16,"What?!
"
,,
7,16,"Now that some time has
"
,,
7,16,"passed, do you wanna go out?
"
,,
7,16,"exiled to the new world </i>
"
,,
7,16,"believing he was dead,</i>
"
,,
7,16,"now free to marry her.</i>
"
,,
7,16,"The bride and groom
"
,,
7,16,"have written their own vows.
"
,,
7,16,"Our love is like two
"
,,
7,16,"figs hanging from a fig tree,
"
,,
7,16,"cradled by Cupid's own hand.
"
,,
7,16,"You and I are like t...
"
,,
7,16,"Oh ...oh ... I'm sorry.
"
,,
7,16,"Is my wedding interrupting
"
,,
7,16,"your .. your promotion?
"
,,
7,16,"We're right in the middle of our show.
"
,,
7,16,"OK, right now. You
"
,,
7,16,"have a time slot. Go there!
"
,,
7,16,"Maybe finish this candy bar
"
,,
7,16,"before you open another one.
"
,,
7,16,"Well, at least it wasn't one of those
"
,,
7,16,"promos where they've got the whole
"
,,
7,16,"cast shoving each other
"
,,
7,16,"playfully,  like they're all good pals.
"
,,
7,16,"Oh, oh, look! There we go! Oh, look
"
,,
7,16,"at 'em jostling each other around.
"
,,
7,16,"Oh, they give each other a
"
,,
7,16,"hard time, but they're friends.
"
,,
7,16,"Is that areal show?
"
,,
7,16,"No, it's just ... no, it's ..
"
,,
7,16,"somebody's makin' a joke. Forget it.
"
,,
7,16,"the other exiles passed the time</i>
"
,,
7,16,"Ah, crap! A splinter.
"
,,
7,16," Well, it's been nice knowin' you guys.
"
,,
7,16," So, what'd you do to get exiled?
"
,,
7,16,"I got caught pleasuring
"
,,
7,16,"myself to a painstakingly
"
,,
7,16,"etched engraving of the wife of Bath.
"
,,
7,16,"What you do?
"
,,
7,16,"Ah, I slept with an underaged virgin
"
,,
7,16,"to cure my puff penis.
"
,,
7,16,"Hey, fellers. You wanna join
"
,,
7,16,"me in a game of mumble peg?
"
,,
7,16," Oh, no thanks.
"
,,
7,16," Fine, I'll play by myself.
"
,,
7,16,".. mumble .. mumble .. mumble ..
"
,,
7,16,".. mumble .. mumble .. mumble ..
"
,,
7,16,"One - nothing.
"
,,
7,16," finally reached the new world.</i>
"
,,
7,16,"I declare this land .. Quahog.
"
,,
7,16,"This place is nothin' but a
"
,,
7,16,"wilderness. What're we gonna do?
"
,,
7,16,"We're gonna build a new settlement.
"
,,
7,16,"We'll have a happy new life,
"
,,
7,16,"and we'll have equal rights for all.
"
,,
7,16,"Except Blacks, Asians, Hispanics,
"
,,
7,16,"Jews, Gays, Women, Muslims ..
"
,,
7,16,"Um ... everybody
"
,,
7,16,"who's not a white man.
"
,,
7,16,"And I mean ""white"" white,
"
,,
7,16,"so no Italians, no Polish. Just people
"
,,
7,16,"from Ireland, England, and Scotland.
"
,,
7,16,"But from only certain
"
,,
7,16,"parts of Scotland and Ireland.
"
,,
7,16,"Just full blooded whites.
"
,,
7,16,"No, y'know what? Not even whites.
"
,,
7,16,"Nobody gets any rights.
"
,,
7,16,"Ahhhh ... America.
"
,,
7,16,"How's your
"
,,
7,16,"stewed fox-quail, my dear?
"
,,
7,16,"Oh, it's quite good.
"
,,
7,16,"I'm also enjoyin' the turtled hen.
"
,,
7,16,"Isn't the turtled hen good?
"
,,
7,16,"So, listen. You and I
"
,,
7,16,"need to have a conversation
"
,,
7,16,"about you not bearing me a son.
"
,,
7,16,"Well, my Lord, we've discussed this.
"
,,
7,16,"We have to have sex in
"
,,
7,16,"order for me to bear you a son.
"
,,
7,16,"Oh, I know. I've just been so
"
,,
7,16,"tired, and I've had so much work,
"
,,
7,16,"and I think .. I think
"
,,
7,16,"I wanted to the other day
"
,,
7,16,"but I couldn't find you.
"
,,
7,16,"So, y'know, it's like both of
"
,,
7,16," us on our schedules, y'know?
"
,,
7,16,"Well, why don't we do it tonight?
"
,,
7,16,"Maybe. Tonight might work. Yea...
"
,,
7,16,"Oh, no! I got that thing in the morning.
"
,,
7,16,"Oh .. how 'bout tomorrow at four?
"
,,
7,16,"You know I'm with
"
,,
7,16,"my mother tomorrow at four.
"
,,
7,16,"Oh, darn it! I'm going to
"
,,
7,16,"be so horny tomorrow at four.
"
,,
7,16,"Y'know, I gotta say, I'm a little mad
"
,,
7,16,"at you for not bein' more available.
"
,,
7,16,"We can have sex
"
,,
7,16,"right now on the table.
"
,,
7,16,"Hey! hey, hey, hey ... hey.
"
,,
7,16,"We eat here.
"
,,
7,16,"colonists worked day and night</i>
"
,,
7,16,"settlement, until finally,</i>
"
,,
7,16,"colony of Quahog was complete.</i>
"
,,
7,16,"was a thriving new world settlement,</i>
"
,,
7,16,"Boy, everything's
"
,,
7,16,"shapin' up real nice.
"
,,
7,16,"Yeah, and we finally
"
,,
7,16,"finished the town Abortion Clinic.
"
,,
7,16,"Griffin forget Lady Redbush,</i>
"
,,
7,16,"himself a hearty new wife.</i>
"
,,
7,16,"Boy, that was fantastic.
"
,,
7,16,"You must have had a lot of practice.
"
,,
7,16,"No, not really. I've been
"
,,
7,16,"saving myself for marriage.
"
,,
7,16,"Ahhhhhh ....... We should 
"
,,
7,16,"probably open up some windows.
"
,,
7,16,"I don't know what to do, jester. I
"
,,
7,16,"can't be married to the King anymore.
"
,,
7,16,"My heart still
"
,,
7,16,"belongs to Griffin Peterson,
"
,,
7,16,"but he's dead.
"
,,
7,16," Ahh. No. He's not.
"
,,
7,16," What?
"
,,
7,16,"I was ordered to keep silent by
"
,,
7,16,"the King, under threat of execution
"
,,
7,16,"but .. you're gonna see this anyway.
"
,,
7,16,"Oh, my God! He's alive!
"
,,
7,16,"Jester, I've got to get to him.
"
,,
7,16,"I'll help you. But
"
,,
7,16,"only if I can go with you.
"
,,
7,16,"If I stay here, the King'll
"
,,
7,16,"execute me for telling you all this.
"
,,
7,16,"Well .. OK. But how
"
,,
7,16,"are we gonna get there?
"
,,
7,16,"We'll hitch a ride on one of
"
,,
7,16,"the slave ships tomorrow night,
"
,,
7,16,"after an all new Shovin' Buddies.
"
,,
7,16,"Followed by an all
"
,,
7,16,"new slowly rotating black man.
"
,,
7,16,"sailed off to the new world.</i>
"
,,
7,16," his new wife was a pain in him arse.</i>
"
,,
7,16,".. and then I
"
,,
7,16,"finished scrubbing the kettle
"
,,
7,16,"but .. then I saw that I'd missed a spot
"
,,
7,16,"and, oh .. I was so worried that
"
,,
7,16,"the whole thing wasn't clean enough
"
,,
7,16,"so I went back and started
"
,,
7,16,"washing it again, and sure enough ...
"
,,
7,16,".. I'd missed another spot, and
"
,,
7,16,"there was a clump of cornmeal
"
,,
7,16," under the rim
"
,,
7,16,"from when I made breakfast.
"
,,
7,16," Shut up, Meg! I prithee, shut up!
"
,,
7,16,"Griffen!
"
,,
7,16,"Lady Redbush.
"
,,
7,16,"Lady Redbush were happily reunited.</i>
"
,,
7,16,"through the complex, extensive divorce</i>
"
,,
7,16,"by 18th century society.</i>
"
,,
7,16,"Gone! What do you mean she's gone?
"
,,
7,16,"Sire, Lady Redbush has
"
,,
7,16,"been gone these 6 months.
"
,,
7,16," 6 months?
"
,,
7,16," Yes. Forgive me, Sire, but how
"
,,
7,16," could you not be aware of this?
"
,,
7,16,"Don't you share a
"
,,
7,16,"bed chamber with her?
"
,,
7,16,"Well, I mean, sometimes we .. we..
"
,,
7,16," we sleep .. we.. we go to different ..
"
,,
7,16,"er, we go to bed at.. at different
"
,,
7,16,"times. We've both been so busy ...
"
,,
7,16,"it's been .. rediculous! I .. I thought
"
,,
7,16,"she was takin' a class or something.
"
,,
7,16,"Oh, man, that sucks!
"
,,
7,16,"Because I'm so horny.
"
,,
7,16,"Damn it! Oh, I wanted
"
,,
7,16,"to do sex to her tonight.
"
,,
7,16,"Well then, I guess
"
,,
7,16,"we've gotta go get her.
"
,,
7,16,"Yeah .. alright.
"
,,
7,16,"and Lady Redbush continued to</i>
"
,,
7,16,"the colony of Quahog,</i>

7,16,"locusts they descended </i>
"
,,
7,16,"make the townfolk flee</i>
"
,,
7,16,"They've gotta be here somewhere.

7,16,"Where's my 1st lieutenant?
"
,,
7,16,"Here I am, sir. Yessir, right

7,16,"Redbush and Griffin Peterson.
"
,,
7,16,"That fat bastard thinks he can
"
,,
7,16,"steal my bride and get away with it
"
,,
7,16,"I wouldn't bet a corn
"
,,
7,16,"farthing on him escaping.
"
,,
7,16,"No, I wouldn't. Not a corn
"
,,
7,16,"farthing would I bet. No sir.
"
,,
7,16," What's wrong with you?
"
,,
7,16," Little wrong in the head, I am,

7,16,"Oh, Griffin, this time together
"
,,
7,16,"has been the happiest of my life.

,,
7,16,"Me too, Lady Redbush.
"
,,
7,16,"All those months I was
"
,,
7,16,"without you, I never stopped
"
,,
7,16,"seein' your face in
"
,,
7,16,"the back of my wife's head.
"
,,
7,16,"And all those months I
"
,,
7,16,"was sailin' for the new world
"
,,
7,16,"I saw your face
"
,,
7,16,"in every slave's stomach.
"
,,
7,16,"Tell me we'll be together forever.
"
,,
7,16,"We will.

7,16,"and then I'm gonna kill you!
"
,,
7,16,"Alright, alright,

,,
7,16,"Mr. King, sir. You win.
"
,,
7,16,"I'm sorry, Lady Redbush.

7,16,"throw down your weapons.
"
,,
7,16,"Go ahead and kill him, Griffin.
"

7,16,"You kill him, and I'll kill her.

7,16,"You kill her, I'll kill him.
"

7,16,"Wait! Wait! There's gotta

7,16," Talent show?

,,
7,16," Talent show!
"
,,
7,16,"Hear ye! Hear ye!
"
,,
7,16,"This talent competition will

,,
7,16,"decide rightful possession of
"
,,
7,16,"the good Lady Redbush and

7,16,"control of the colony of Quahog.
"
,,
7,16,"We first present
"
,,
7,16,"King Stewart of England with
"
,,
7,16,"some observational humour.
"
,,
7,16,"Hi, there, everybody.
"
,,
7,16,"You know, my aunt
"
,,
7,16,"Frieda was a real card.
"
,,
7,16,"She always had
"
,,
7,16,"the most wonderful spirit,
"
,,
7,16,"even when her mind started to go.
"
,,
7,16,"What the !*$#@?
"
,,
7,16,"I remember once, she
"
,,
7,16,"wrote a letter to my uncle Tom
"
,,
7,16,"from whom she'd been
"
,,
7,16,"divorced for several years.
"
,,
7,16,"And in the letter, she'd
"
,,
7,16,"misspelled his name T-O-M-M.
"
,,
7,16,"This .. this is my bit.
"
,,
7,16,"These .. these are all my bits.
"
,,
7,16,"Ssshh. This is funny.
"
,,
7,16,"Unbelievable.
"
,,
7,16,"And I said, ""Frieda, you've
"
,,
7,16,"spelled Tom's name wrong.""
"
,,
7,16,"""You need to take out one of the M's.""
"
,,
7,16,"And she said, ""Which one?""
"
,,
7,16,"Clap your hands, everybody.
"
,,
7,16,"And everybody clap your hands.
"
,,
7,16,"We are the Quahog colonists
"
,,
7,16," and Mort the Jew.
"
,,
7,16," Hey there.
"
,,
7,16,"We're out here on stage tonight
"
,,
7,16,"to do a show for you
"
,,
7,16,"We got Peterson on the violin
"

,,
7,16,"Aaaaaaarrrrrrrrr! Break!
"
,,
7,16,"Oh, God. They put
"
,,
7,16,"so much work into theirs.
"
,,
7,16,"I .. I didn't know
"
,,
7,16,"we could rip off movies.
"
,,
7,16,"Redbush and Griffin Peterson</i>
"
,,
7,16," Oh, Griffen, I love you.
"
,,
7,16," And I, you.
"

7,16,"Let's grow old into our 30's together.
"
,,
7,16,"I wanna have a baby with you.
"
,,
7,16,"And I wanna be there there

7,16,"when you die, giving birth to it.
"
,,
7,16,"And so ends the tale of Griffin
"

7,16,"Peterson and the founding of Quahog.
"
,,
7,16,"Well, what a bunch of
